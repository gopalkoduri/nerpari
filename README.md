Introduction
------------

There are two paradigms that were in vogue for extracting assertions from natural language text: Traditional IE starts with a predefined vocabulary and hueristics for a domain that will help in identifying the entities and the relations between them. Open IE is a task which intends to scale relation extraction by learning about the entities and their relations, without the requirement of pre-defined vocabularies.
