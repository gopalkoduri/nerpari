Ranganatha Sarma also took part in the discussion and talked &#8211; and sang &#8211; about the beauty of Dikshitar kritis in both Hindustani and Carnatic music. He referred to the Hindustani raag &#8216;Ramkali' and sang the piece &#8216;Rama Rama Kali Kalusha.'He also explained Carnatic ragas derived from Hindustani such as Yaman Kalyani (&#8216;Jambupathe Maam Pahi'&#8211; a Panchalinga kshethra kriti), Subhapanthuvarali (&#8216;Sree Sathyanarayanam'), Ameer Kalyani (&#8216;Purahara Nandana') and so on.

He also sang &#8216;Sree Rama Saraswathi Sevitham' (Nasikabhooshani/Nasamani) before going on to the main item.&#8216;Sree Kamalamba,' a kriti from Kamalamba Navaavaranam in Bhairavi, was stunning as the main item of the day.
