VThe Sica music lovers were treated to an orthodox Carnatic katcheri with Madurai T. N. Seshagopalan's opening varanam in Khamboji. What followed was a feast with rare but lovely kritis served with utter dedication. The organisation bestowed on him &#8216;Sangeetha Chakravarthy' title on the occasion of their annual art festival which he so richly deserved.So, the king of music took us on a heavenly trip with &#8216; Mahaganapatim manasa smaraami&#8230;' in Hamsadhwani with effortless ease through the improvisations. The elaborate alapana opened up vistas of Purvi Kalyani with the incomparable Shyama Sastri's &#8216; Ninnu vina mari dikkevvaru&#8230;' on Kanchi Kamakshi. Seshagopalan's emotive rendition added glitter to the kriti especially the lines, &#8216; sthiramu leka chapaludaitinamma&#8230;' where he elongated the syllables to stress on the bhava which was simply superb. The scaling down of the swaras to a single solpha syllable (taggimpu), a stylistic variation whereby the three kalais are touched upon, was created and recreated with majestic charm so akin to Seshagopalan. Two Dikshitar kritis, one in Brindavana Saranga and the main piece in Thodi reached their zenith in his able tone. &#8216; Soundar rajam aashrayami&#8230;' echoed with perfection by Komunduri Venkata Krishna, a raga pregnant with meaning flowed like an unruffled river &#8211; slow (Vilamba kalai) and steady. The mitram in madhyama was like a slight ripple. The virtuosity of the vocalist came to the fore with &#8216; Sri Krishnam bhaje&#8230;' where the sangathees were delineated with authority as was the neraval and the mind-boggling kalpana swaras at the &#8216; Pankajaksha&#8230;' Beginning at the lower octave, he went on the war-path shooting improvisations with lightning speed and velocity. The violinist was an enthusiast who tried his best to keep pace with this rain of musical arrows that came dazzling one after another. The laya-vinayasam (Prasad on the mridangam and Nemani Somayajulu on the ghatam) was a rhythmic experience with the percussionists vying with each other. Nemani was no match to the mridangam player though.Seshagopalan was in his full form with the Ragamaalika which was virtually a garland of myriad ragas ranging from Bahudari to Mohana, Kamas, Atana, Sindhu Bhairavi, and what not. He switched ragas in a jiffy even before the sentence was completed. But the elaboration of these ragas in a brief period of time was beautiful. The potency of each raga was made to stand out singularly and seamlessly merge into the next till it got down to the brilliant tillana in which the vocalist excelled. The audience' cup was full and so did the musician call it a day. This festive evening was hosted at Ravindra Bharati.
