VSixty years are a fairly long time even in the lives of nations. And to celebrate 60 years of diplomatic relations between Austria and India, the Austrian Embassy and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) in New Delhi have invited the Vienna Chamber Orchestra to give a few performances in India, where the orchestra consisting of about 40 musicians is currently engaged in an assorted tour programme. While the concerts in New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkota feature the whole orchestra, some smaller groups have been formed to visit several other cities, including Chennai, Bangaluru, Goa and Shillong, and they are called &#8216;Soloists of the Vienna Chamber Orchestra.&#8217;The ensemble which gave a performance in Chennai last week consisted of seven talented musicians, five of them playing string instruments (violin, viola, double-bass), and two playing wind instruments (oboe, English and French horns). ICCR, which is based in the Capital, has been actively concerned for a long time with presenting Indian cultural colours abroad and bringing foreign cultural colours to India. Most of the latter events naturally take place in New Delhi. The Council has an office in Chennai, and one hopes it will bring many more visiting musicians from various foreign countries to this city in the future.That there&#8217;s a hard core of music-lovers here who are very seriously interested in Western classical music was evident from the fairly large and highly enthusiastic gathering which had assembled in the Pethachi auditorium  to hear the performance of the visitors from Vienna. The audience consisted of many elderly persons, many youngsters, and even some children.Given the world-wide good reputation of the Vienna Chamber Orchestra, everyone seemed to be eagerly looking forward to a substantial and memorable musical experience. And all the musicians were quite earnest and performed extremely well. However, the overall musical experience of the listeners turned out to be rather superficial and quite unsatisfying. This was so because the entire programme &#8212; including an avoidable running commentary by one of the musicians about the nature of the instruments (&#8216;The violin and viola are made of superior wood...,&#8217; etc.) &#8212; lasted only about an hour.The concert featured only three very short works by Mozart, which included a divertimento for five strings, and the famous opus &#8216;Nannerl Septet&#8217; for strings and horns, dedicated by Mozart to his sister Nannerl. Anyone familiar with the last piece of music would have quickly spotted an anomaly because the part meant for the violin-cello was actually played by the double-bass. (Apparently the orchestra&#8217;s cellist had gone away with another group to some other city). But this hardly seemed to matter, because the whole team&#8217;s performance was extremely smooth and had a silky tone, and there weren&#8217;t any jarring notes at all.But what really did matter in this alien setting was not whether the music was good enough &#8212; it certainly had to be! &#8212; but whether it was substantial enough. What&#8217;s the point of taking all the trouble to bring such accomplished musicians quarter-way across the world merely for dispensing such a small dose of their wonderful music to such an enthusiastic foreign audience, as if it were a strong medicine?
