VJitesh Sundaram has pulled off a musical coupe. He has brought two of India's leading ghazal singers &#8211; Pankaj Udhas and Anup Jalota &#8211; to sing in Malayalam.The two maestros have sung in &#8216;Ennumee Swaram,' an album of ghazals composed by Jitesh. The album, which marks the Thalassery-born singer's debut as a composer, will be released in Kozhikode on January 5. &#8220;Although I have tuned ghazals and bhajans before, this is my first recording as a composer. I consider myself extremely fortunate to have Udhas and Jalota sing in the first ever album tuned by me,&#8221; says Jitesh.Favourite singersHe adds: &#8220;They are among my favourite singers and they didn't accept any payment to sing in my album. Jalota has been my guru, without whose blessing I would not have become a ghazal singer. He was instrumental in giving me opportunities in Mumbai, where I am settled now.&#8220;This is the first time that Udhas is singing in a South Indian language; yes, he did find the pronunciation of certain Malayalam words tough but he has tried hard. I would not claim that his or Jalota's diction is perfect, but I am sure Malayali music lovers would certainly enjoy listening to these great voices in my album.&#8221;The rest of the songs in the album are sung by Jitesh himself. All the songs have been penned by Rafeeq Ahmed. &#8220;I got exactly what I wanted from Rafeeq. Contrary to what most people believe, a ghazal is not just a song sung at a low pace. A ghazal needs to meet certain requirements; for instance, a couplet has to stand on its own and its meaning and rhyme have to be used in a precise way. When I decided to come out with an album of ghazals in Malayalam, I wanted to do it in the true style of a ghazal,&#8221; says Jitesh, who sung and acted in Kamal's &#8216;Megha Malhar.'He adds that he has got the best of musicians to work for &#8216;Ennumee Swaram.He says he has tried to bring varied tones to his compositions. &#8220;I have created different moods and used different ragas such as Yaman, Bhairavi, Piloo, Desh, Kafi and Darbari,&#8221; he explains. Jitesh is planning to release the album in Hindi as well. &#8220;I will get all the songs written in Hindi and I might use even more singers for that album. I would like to work with someone like Chandan Das, a ghazal singer who hasn't got his due,&#8221; says Jitesh who also dreams of having Jagjit Singh sing a Malayalam ghazal one day.
