VSudha&#8217;s venture into composing has been rewarding. Blessed with a vivid, varied and powerful, yet simple vocabulary, she has been triumphant in pouring out her heart through her compositions. Her bhakti predominant themes have been endearing. Couched in simplicity the lyrics of her vaaggeya (vaak+geya: that words that can be sung) songs have been powerful communicators. About 30 of her songs, easily accessible even to a lay man have been brought out in a book and different CDs rendered by veteran  vocalist R.K. Padmanabha and his students. The books and CDs were released at H.N. Kalakshetra by Mattoor Krishnamurthy.After the release-function, R.K. Padmanabha sent the audience into raptures with his rich singing of some select compositions of Sudha Rao. As a tribute to her talent and skill, Padmanabha has created and dedicated to her a new raga called Rama Sudha, derived from the Rasikapriya melakartha. Her krithi &#8220;Jaya Jaya Rama Sudha&#8221; was tuned and sung in this raga leaving the audience spellbound. Aptly accompanied by J. K. Sridhar (violin), C. Cheluvaraju (mridanga) and M.A. Krishnamurthy (ghata). RKP sang &#8220;Namipevu ninage&#8221; (Nata), &#8220;Manthralayake&#8221; (Ahir Bhairav), &#8220;Tungateeradi&#8221; (Hameer Kalyani), &#8220;Guru Vadiraja&#8221; (Ranjani) and others with his usual verve.***** Seasoned singer S. Sowmya&#8217;s layered, attractive and impressive musical phrases moving in all the three octaves captivated the rasikas at Sri Avani Shringeri Math, Mahalakshmi Layout. It was a delight to hear her rendering demanding ragas like Manji (&#8220;Brovavamma&#8221; in vilamba kala), Kiranavali (&#8220;Paraaku neekelara&#8221;), Poorvi Kalyani (&#8220;Ninnuvinaga mari&#8221;), Dwijavanthi (&#8220;Akhilandeshwari&#8221;) and Mayamalavagowla (&#8220;Aadikondar&#8221;). Charulatha Ramanuram (violin), H.S. Sudheedra (mridanga) and Narayanamurthy (ghata) imparted rewarding support.***** Youthful and seasoned nagaswara artiste V. Murali directed a unique ensemble of nagaswaras, saxophones and dolus at the same venue and enthralled the packed rasikas.The road in front of the Math was converted into a huge platform and about 128 instrumentalists (including 36 from Tamilnadu and 28 from Andhra Pradesh) comprising 51 nagaswaras, 25 saxophones, 51 dolus (tavils) and a few shrithi and tala vidwans filled the platform making it a visual delight. It was noteworthy that the ensemble worked out the programme with a fine understanding and synchronising melodies.It had a traditional beginning with a traditional Mallari (Gambheer Nata). &#8220;Vatapi Ganapathim Bhaje&#8221; with swaras followed by &#8220;Saraswathi Namostute&#8221; (Saraswathi, with chittaiswaras) created a lively tempo. &#8220;Sadhinchane&#8221; (Arabhi), &#8220;Devadideva&#8221; (Sunadavinodini), &#8220;Nagumomu&#8221; (Abheri), &#8220;Endaro Mahanubhavulu&#8221; (Sri) captivated the listeners with their moving phrases, raga and sahitya bhavas.
