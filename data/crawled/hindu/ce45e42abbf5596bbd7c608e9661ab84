VGUDIPOODI SRIHARILaya, a young music sabha, celebrated its fourth anniversary at Thyagaraya Gana Sabha, last week, by featuring the legendary Andhra violinist Avasarala Kanyakumari, in a delightful solo in the company of D.S.R. Murthy on mridangam and P.V. Ramanamurthy on ghatam. Her disciple Anuthama accompanied her on the second violin. Kanyakumari, till recently was bracketed in the list of Tamil artistes for the very reason that she was educated and brought up in Chennai and has  accom\u000apanied Tamil artistes like M.L. Vasanthakumari, till almost M.L.V breathed her last.But Kanyakumari has greater influence of Dwaram play, for she learned from Ivaturi Vijjeswara Rao, who in turn was the student of Dwaram Narasimha Rao. Kanyakumari hails from Avasarala family of that area and later moved to Chennai with her parents. Besides doing her graduation in Queen Mary&#8217;s college, she was under the tutelage of Chandrasekharan.She sharpened her style after she attracted the attention of the late Sangita Kalanidhi M.L.Vasanthakumari, who had her as her accompanist for most of her life.Kanyakumari went to all places and shared the glory of M.L.V with her own accomplishment.Later, she began accompanying Mandolin Srinivasand also played with Kadiri Gopalanath (saxophone). D.S.R. Murthy who launched this music sabha&#8216;Laya&#8217;has been holding a variety of concerts, inviting young and old artiste\u000as.Kanyakumari&#8217;s solo gave a finishing touch to the anniversary of Laya&#8217;s activities. Dr. Aripirala Viswam, a poet and spiritual person, blessed the organisation.
