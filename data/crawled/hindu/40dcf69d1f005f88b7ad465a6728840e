VNIKHIL VARGHESEMusic evokes emotions, brings together experiences, blends traditions and when the might of Carnatic music meets the cadence of Flamenco (a form of Spanish music), it is sheer magic. Flamenco found many takers in Thiruvananthapuram who were yearning for a new and different musical experience. And the concert organised by the Alliance Francaise de Trivandrum did just that. A fusion musical concert by Beuroshna, a Spanish musical troupe, and Carnatic singers, M.D. Jayan and Padma Krishna, took the audience at Vyloppilli Samskirthi Bhavan, to a new level of rhythm and melody.Nacho Corral, who leads a music band in Spain, had composed the music for the concert. As the voice of Belen Cantos synchronised with the guitar notes played by Nacho Corral himself, M.D. Jayan on the mridangam and Padma Krishna on the violin beautifully followed up the fast numbers, effortlessly bringing out the ethos of classical music. The concert fused the ragas of Carnatic with the Buleriyas Tala of Flamenco. The performance took off with the rendition of `The Poem,' set in Malahari, which reflected on the troupe's experiences in Thiruvananthapuram.The spirit and beliefs of Spain found their expression in the next song set in Thodi. The numbers in Nadabhairavi and Mayamalavagaula, dedicated to Ganesha, spoke on the plight of women the world over. Beginning on a slow note on the Flamenco guitar, the rhythm soon picked up and when the music reached a crescendo, the fast numbers in Spanish set amidst Carnatic music notes resonated with the emotions of the audience. Thunderous applause that followed each recital proved beyond doubt that the appreciation of music recognises no barriers of language and culture.Bottom Template Starts
