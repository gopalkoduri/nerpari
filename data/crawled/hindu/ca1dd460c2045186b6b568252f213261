VPandit Krishnarao Shankar Pandit Centre for Traditional Music  launched the year-long platinum jubilee celebrations of Pandit Laxman Krishnarao Pandit with the inaugural concert of the doyen of the Gwalior gharana at the Stein Auditorium this past week. Panditji, as he is widely addressed, belongs to the  unbroken lineage of the Pandits of  Gwalior who were  musicians at the erstwhile Maratha court of the Scindias of Gwalior .Jyotiraditya M. Scindia was the  chief guest and  felicitated Panditji along with other  senior musicians. The auditorium was filled to capacity  with his admirers when  Panditji opened the concert with raga Bageshri-Bahar.A judicious combination of the night melody Bageshri with Bahar, the spring time raga, it  was a  befitting choice for heralding the celebrations. The slow delineation of the raga during the bada khayal, set to vilambit Ek tala, opened the raga&#8217;s folds seamlessly, caressing each note with  tender care. Panditji follows the Gwalior gharana format faithfully and develops ragas in &#8216;ashtaang-gayaki&#8217;, a systematic eightfold elaboration of the raga.This was quite evident even during the chhota khayal &#8220;Sundar  si  kaliyaan&#8230;&#8221; set to Teen  tala and the following raga Basant with its popular bandish (composition) &#8220;Piya sang khelo&#8230;&#8221;People were eagerly  waiting for a tappa to follow , as  he is one of the few musicians today, who can render the difficult genre of the taxing tappa with ease and fluidity. Instead,  he chose  a traditional Hori, as  it was the eve of  Holi . The composition described the gay  abandon of Lord Rama playing Holi in Awadh, where the mukhra (opening phrase) itself had intricate nuances of tappa ang to the satisfaction of those who wanted to listen to his  tappa.The doyen  was  ably accompanied on  the tabla by Ustad Faiyyaz Khan, while Murad Ali gave him melodious support on the sarangi. Meeta and other disciples assisted him in singing. The inaugural concert will be followed by a series  in Mumbai,Gwalior, Bhopal,  Nagpur, Pune and  Bangalore.The Sanskriti Pratishthan presented Kumar Mardur, the able recipient of the Mani Mann scholarship, in a vocal concert at Anand Gram the other day. Hailing from the rich musical tradition of Dharwad, Kumar is the gifted son and disciple of  Somnath Mardur, who  is a senior disciple of Pandit Vasavraj Rajguru. Having done his  masters in  music, Kumar is taking  guidance from the famous Firoz Dastoor of the Kirana gharana.Endowed with a melodious voice and an enchanting aesthetic sense, Kumar was a delight  in the artistic environs of  Anand Gram, that literally lived up to its name that evening.Kumar Mardur opened his concert with Yaman, the most appealing evening raga. The slow composition &#8220;Deejo daras tum&#8230;&#8221; set to vilambit (slow) Jhap tala was elaborated not only with grammatically correct treatment of the raga but also with beautiful imagery.The systematic alap-barhat and the varied taan patterns continued during the popular chhota khayal &#8220;Eri aali piya bin&#8230;&#8221;Kumar sang raga Basant next with the medium tempo composition in Teen tala, &#8220;Fagawaa  brij dekhan ko chali ri&#8221; before he concluded his vocal recital with &#8220;Aaj khelo  shyam sang  hori&#8230;&#8221; an oft-heard composition in raga Kafi, but with a difference. Kumar presented it in the style of a &#8216;bandish ki thumri&#8217; set to addha theka with the customary &#8216;bol-banaav&#8217; and the climax  laggi  was superbly played on the tabla  by Prasun Chatterjee.Parvesh Mallik accompanied Kumar on the harmonium, while Murad Ali enhanced his recital.&#8226;Son of Padma Bhushan Pt. Krishnarao Shankar Pandit&#8226;Doyen of Gwalior Gharana&#8226;Fifth in an unbroken lineage of legendary musicians&#8226;Can render the difficult genre of tappa with ease and fluidity&#8226;Winner of numerous awards including Tappa Samrat, Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, Ustad Hafiz Ali Award, Pt. Omkarnath Thakur Award&#8226;His daughter, Meeta Pandit, is also a renowned singer
