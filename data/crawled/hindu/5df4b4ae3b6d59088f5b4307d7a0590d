VAs this month's programme, Vijayawada's Swarajhari Sabha presented an attractive vocal concert by V. Jyothi Sridevi of Delhi, an accomplished singer who received her training from veterans like R. Vedavalli and late Voleti Venkateswarlu. She received her Sangeeta Vidwan certificate in first class from the Central College of Music, Chennai and also got her M. Phil from Mother Theresa University in Kodaikanal. Jyothi Sridevi hails from a family of musicians and music lovers.Her music is traditional and scholarly, pleasing connoisseurs. She began the concert at Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram with a crisp varnam in Behag followed by a tarangam of Narayana Teertha, Jaya Jaya Swamin in Nata. After singing Janani Pahi of Swathi Thirunal in Sudha Saveri, Jyothi rendered an effective version of Begada, in which she sang Thyagaraja's Sundari Ninne and Devi Brova of Syama Sastri, showing excellent command of the manodharmam aspects.The highlight of Jyothi Sridevi's concert was the elaborately sung Hiranmayim in Lalita, and Bhajare of Dikshitar in Kalyani. Both the ragas were treated with superb alapanas and swaras. In between the two items, Jyothi sang Edi nee bahubala, a rare composition of Thyagaraja in Kafi.B.V. Durga Bhavani and K. Sai Giridhar supported Jyothi Sridevi on the violin and mridangam respectively. Bhavani's version of Kalyani and Sai Giridhar's tani deserve special mention.Jyothi closed her concert with a couple of Hindi bhajans and a sparkling thillana in Rageswari.
