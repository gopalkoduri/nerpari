VIt was a sight to watch the Raj Bhavan's open air facade filled with luminaries who gathered to welcome &#8216;Sri Khara' New Year and also to listen to the violin recital of Avasarala Kanyakumari, rightly chosen to be part of Ugadi celebrations. The august presence included Chief Minister Kirankumar Reddy, opposition leaders and others. Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan, a great lover of Carnatic music said in Telugu that he had organised this concert to show how this year would be a joyous journey. &#8220;India's World Cup win in cricket made people from Himalayas to Kanykumari happy. Instead of going to Kanyakumari, I thought of bringing this Kanyakumari (the artiste) here to time with the onset of &#8216;Khara' New Year,&#8221; he said and wished all a happy new year.Kanyakumari left good memories with a few choice numbers. She opened the concert paying obeisance to Vinayaka with her Vatapi Ganapathim Bhaje in Hamsadhwani.She was in the company of her disciple Rajiv on second violin,Aravindan on mridangam, Ganeshrao on tabla and Kirankumar on pads that was set in &#8216;dolu' mode, with sharp notes and also at times sounded like a bell. Due to improper sound, the second violin was in low volume and pads dominated, at times drowning the second violin sound. However the volume of Kanyakumari's violin was apt and clear, more because of the contact mike. Her play had the touch of a vocalist in expression while rendering the kritis. She concluded the number with breezy swara play and the end was simply thrilling. It was apt that she chose to present next Thyagaraja's popular Pancharatna kirtana Endaro Mahanubhavulu in Sriragam, suiting the occasion.The chittaswaras and the accompanying sahitya in the same notes were enjoyable. She then came out with Brindavanasaranga for Kamalaptakula saying that she was playing this in response to Governor's wife Vimala Narasimhan's wish. This in fact turned out to be the major piece of her concert. She evolved the raga into a mellifluous structure going through the three sthayis.She switched on to light numbers in which Bhagyadalakshmi a composition of Purandaradasa in Sriragam was played, followed by Govinda Naamalu in Revati which gave a different feel.
