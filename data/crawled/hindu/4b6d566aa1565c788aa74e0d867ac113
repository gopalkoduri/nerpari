VA familiar face and a much sought after sitar player for accompanying ensembles of various dance orchestras, Sunil Kant Saxena&#8217;s sitar often distracts you from watching dancers performing on stage. An artiste of merit in his own right, Sunil ha\u000as also been giving solo sitar recitals at prestigious music festivals, at home and abroad. The Epicentre in Gurgaon this past week presented Sunil in a solo sitar recital. He was accompanied on the tabla by Shovan Hazra.A Sangit Visharad in vocal music and sitar, Sunil was initially trained under B.N. Dutta. He was further groomed in sitar under Umashankar Mishra and Amjad Ali Khan. His latest sitar recital vouched for his talent and training under the illustrious gurus. If the detailed alap-jod of his opening raga Shyam Kalyan had the signature of Umashankar Mishra in the&#8216;laraj kharaj ka kaam&#8217;, his Durga compositions reminded one of Amjad Ali Khan. After creating the atmosphere of Shyam Kalyaan with the alap-jod, he played a medium tempo composition in this raga set to and 11-beat tala cycle, followed by a Razakhani gat in Teen tala. Shyam Kalyan was grammatically authentic, except for the occasional Ga Re Ma Ga that sounded like Gaud Sarang.The Carnatic raga Saraswati came next. It has lately become quite popular with Hindustani musicians. Sunil played a medium tempo composition set to drut Ek tala in this raga before playing a couple of compositions in raga Durga set to Teen tala. The gat todas and varied taan patterns amply adorned the compositions but this pentatonic raga does not have the scope to be overstretched, hence it sounded repetitive towards the end.Sunil concluded his sitar recital with a bandish in raga Pilu set to addha theka with   glimpses of ragas like Shivranjani to give it a dhun-like flavour, that ultimately climaxed in &#8220;Raghupati Raghav&#8221;. The dadra-like treatment gave the familiar bhajan an entirely fresh flavour. Shovan Hazra, a disciple of Kumar Bose, was competent on the tabla.The other highlight of the week was a musical evening at the India Habitat Centre with the world music album launch of the talented young brothers, sarangi exponent Murad Ali, and sitar player Fateh Ali.Gifted sons and disciples of Ghulam Sabir, the duo belongs to the famous Moradabad gharana. Although trained in the strict discipline ofgharanedaar taalim, the youngsters have ventured into fusion with world class musicians including Shubha Mudgal. This is for the first time they played together for a world music album launched by Mystica Music &#8212; hence the name of the album is &#8216;Convergence&#8217;.Artistes like Anish Pradhan, Fateh Singh Gangaani and Talvin Singh from the U.K. have also contributed to the musical venture.On the occasion, Fateh Ali gave a solo sitar recital, playing Jhinjhoti, one of the most melodious ragas, which was followed by a track from the album played live together by Murad on the sarangi and Fateh on the sitar. The piece sounded like it was based on raga Vachaspati with a tinge of Kirvani. The other tracks comprise &#8220;Ode to Granada&#8221; and also the poetry of Jigar Moradabadi recited by Murad Ali.
