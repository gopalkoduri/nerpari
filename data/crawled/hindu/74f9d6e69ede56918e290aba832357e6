VKunthalam, Varali and Kunthalavarali are the three  ragas covering the seven  compositions sung by Gayathri Girish for the fifth  volume in the Dakshin series of compact discs released by Rajalakshmi Audio.The disc commences with a virutham in Varali attributed to Ghanam Krishna Iyer. The virutham is followed by a varnam in the same raga in Tisra Triputa talam, composed by K. Ponnaiah Pillai. This Tamizh varnam &#8216;Pavai Nee Parai&#8217; is one of those rarely heard in the current concert circuit. The vocalist has presented this piece with clarity.Raga Kunthalam is a vivadi raga of the asampoorna paddhati and is known as &#8216;Kanthamani&#8217; in the sampoorna paddhati. Gayathri has rendered two songs in Kunthalam in this disc.The first is a Thiruvottriyur Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Maati Maatiki&#8217; which is followed by a Muthuswamy Dikshitar composition &#8216;Sri Sugandhi&#8217; in praise of the Goddess enshrined in the Rockfort temple,  Tiruchirapalli.A verse from Adi Sankara&#8217;s Tripurasundari Ashtakam precedes this kriti. The tricky vivadi raga is handled confidently by Gayathri.In her rendition of &#8216;Sri Sugandhi,&#8217; Gayathri in the samashti charanam sings the sahityam as &#8216;Vaasudeva Sri Guruguha Varadaraja&#8217; and then &#8216;Rajeshwari.&#8217; The proper split of the lyrics should have been as &#8216;Vaasudeva Sri Guruguha Varada&#8217; and then &#8216;Raja Rajeshwari.&#8217; What the composer means is that Goddess Sugantha Kunthalambika bestows boons on Vaasudeva (Vishnu) and Guruguha (Muruga).Varada in this context stands for bestower of boons and does not denote &#8216;Varadaraja&#8217; (Vishnu). The songs in Kunthalavarali vocalised are a rare creation of Veenai Kuppier &#8216;Kannathandri&#8217; and the popular Swati Tirunal composition &#8216;Bogindra Saayinam.&#8217; Gayathri renders kalpanaswaras at &#8216;Padmanabham&#8217; for the royal composer&#8217;s song with precision though there is a slight hesitancy in reaching the upper madhyama note on a couple of occassions.A soulful rendition of the majestic kriti of Syama Sastri in Varali &#8216;Karunajoodavamma&#8217; is satisfying. The curtains are drawn with a thillana composed by K.S.Raghunathan in Kunthakam, Varali and Kunthalavarali. The accompanists, B.U. Ganeshprasad (violin), Poongulam Subramaniam (mridangam) and S. Karthick (Ghatam) have fulfilled their roles with aplomb.The inlay card mentions the composer of &#8216;Bogindra Saayinam&#8217; as just Swati and the tala of the varnam in Varali reads as &#8216;Tisra Triputa&#8217; which is amusing.Dakshni (Vol. 5)Rajalakshmi audioGayathri GirishCarnatic Classical VocalCD &#8211; (Price Rs. 195)
