VHis innate ability in probing the soul of a raga and his clear diction have stood him in good stead.His thorough grounding in  the esoteric aspects of Carnatic music has been imparted to him by T.N. Seshagopalan. His ascetic disposition and hard-earned insight into the purport of compositions make him an ideal person for lecture-demonstrations.He presented a  concert at  Kalikotta Palace in Thripunithura to illustrate the compositions of Thripunithura Jayaprakash, who signs his kritis as &#8216;Poornaprakasha&#8217;.The concert, organised under the auspices of Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha, began with a charming Hamsadhwani and &#8216;Gurulokaparam.&#8217;A dignified tapestry of Saurashtram adorned the devotion-soaked composition &#8216;Jyeshta-Rajaaya&#8217; on Mahaganapati, set to Roopaka tala.Kharaharapriya was invested with the  required stateliness and &#8216;Garudaaroodha,&#8217; invoking Lord Poornathrayeesa, had a niraval plus varied patterns of swara clusters.Sankarabharanam was followed by &#8216;Havya Vaahatmakaram&#8217; in khanda chaappu, in praise of Lord Siva. &#8216;Sharavanabhava&#8217; in Khanda Tripuda  was garnished with swaras. The lilting aspect in Thodi was brought to the fore in its depiction in &#8216;Sreechakra Raja.&#8217;  Kannada found  sublime expression in &#8216;Sreesavithaa.&#8217;C.S. Anuroop  gave adequate support on the violin. The tonal magic with which Cherthala Jayadevan played the mridangam was ably followed up by Thrikkakara Santharam on the ganjira.
