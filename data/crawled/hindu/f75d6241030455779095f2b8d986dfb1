VWhat makes for a good concert? An assorted choice of songs of various composers in catchy ragas set to different rhythmic patterns, a confident singer with a flexible voice and control over his presentation, backed by smart time management&#8230; these are prime constituents to make a concert gripping.The concert of Swarna Rethas, an up and coming vocalist, with his voice in fine fettle, showcased all these facets.It was held at Raga Sudha hall for Nada Inbam's SVK Birthday Concert Series.&#8216;Sarasijanaba,' the magnificent Khambodi Ata tala varnam provided a stately start for Swarna Rethas' concert. &#8216;Daya Payonidhe' in Jaganmohini by Meesu Krishna Iyer, led up to the raga essay of Sriranjani and Sivan's &#8216;Ini Oru Kanam Unnai Maravaen' with lively swaras.Dikshitar's Navagraha kriti &#8216;Budham Asrayami' (Natakurunji) set to Jhampa talam, went on the right pace to make way for expanding Poorvikalyani. Both Sriranjani and Poorvikalyani are ragas with great vivacity.Vibrant momentsThe intricate inflections and the vibrant hues of these ragas were ingeniously integrated into the raga suites by Rethas. &#8216;Deva Deva Jagadeeswara' of Swati Tirunal was an admirable choice here. The swara exercise in Poorvikalyani was fascinating.The not-so-frequently heard ragamalika of Narayana Tirtha, &#8216;Jaya Jaya Gokula Bala' set on the heavy ragas such as Bhairavi, Atana, Khambodi, Kalyani and Suruti, and &#8216;Ka Guha Shanmuaga' of Koteeswara Iyer in the mela raga Kosalam were glowing fillers.Begada was chosen as the main option, and Rethas took care to exemplify the sparkling phrases of the raga. &#8216;Nadopasana' of Tyagaraja, another worthy selection, was kept at the right tempo; niraval and swaras were for the line &#8216;Tantri laya swara raga'. The swara segment pitched on the exclusive combination of notes to Begada.A few suggestions to Swarna Rethas&#8230; His approach to the raga expositions is quite spontaneous; but on critical listening, one can find an undercurrent of slight restless speed that prevents him from staying on at any place for karvais. This youngster should give some thought to it so that his raga interpretations become more poignant. Similarly, in the swara prayogas, his proclivity to extend them inadvertently effaces the discerning combinations he brings out in between or towards the end. A smart and calculative move can help him to overcome this.B. Ananthakrishnan on the violin was a cool accompanist, responding to all the challenges of Swarna Rethas in right measure. His raga and swara passages also proved his perfect comprehension of the Carnatic idiom. B. Sivaraman on the rhythmic side bolstered the concert and included a brisk and brief thani. The post-thani section included &#8216;Nirupamana' in Behag, &#8216;Parengum Parthalum' in Kalyani (Ganam Krishna Iyer) and a Tiruppugazh.The last but not the least point is the audio system, which was near perfect and balanced, making listening a real pleasure for the audience throughout.
