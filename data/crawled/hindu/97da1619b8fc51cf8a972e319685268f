VLinking music with religion is a potent cultural tradition. Tyagaraja has linked music with our normal life too with unique richness of expression. At one end is his empyrean devotion. At the other is his scathing condemnation of pretentious religiosity and overall conduct. He has strongly proclaimed that adherence to good character or rejection of it leads one to progress or downfall.In the Kuntalavarali kirtana, &#8220;Kalinarulaku,&#8221; he has accurately portrayed  the ills of today&#8217;s society.Daara-SutulakaiDhanamulakai Yuru-PerulakaiBahu Peddatanamuka Sareku Bhakta VesamuGonuvaariki&#8230;(For the sake of wife, children, wealth, popularity and for the status of an elite, people put on the garb of a bhakta.)More pertinent is Tyagaraja&#8217;s observation in the song &#8216;Rama-Rama-Krishna-Yanare&#8217; (Gaulipantu).Yaduti-Pachcha-JoodalekaHitavu-Maatalaade-JanuluChallani-Vaakkulu-BalikiSwaanta-Manala Mynavaaru(Pricked by jealousy on seeing other&#8217;s prosperity, they speak sweetly,  with honey on their lips and poison in their heart).In the Nayaki Kirtana, &#8220;Kanugonu &#8211; Sowkhyamu,&#8221; he refers to the two faces of men.Tanu-VokachoManasokachoDagina-VeshamokachoNidi-JanulaNechu-varriki-Jayamowne(With body in one place and mind in another, but putting on an appropriate hypocritical image &#8211; these can never ensure success.)In a similar vein is his remark in the Yadukulakhambodi song &#8220;Adigaadu &#8212; Bhajana&#8221;Goppa-Tanamukai-AasaKuchchita-PibasaMeppulakai-Bahu-VesamidiUppadhille Daru(Hankering after  elitism, thirsting for  lowly sensual enjoyment, dressed like a dandy fishing for compliments people feel highly upbeat.)Through telling examples he asks what they can really achieve.  The piece in Saveri &#8220;Balamukulamu&#8211;Yela&#8221; mocks at the feigned visage to command attention from others.Patramulano-Meyu- MekaBalamaina-Upaasama(Goats feed on leaves. Is it a matter of fasting?)Guhala-Vesha-KodulundeGunamu-Galku-MownulaGahamunanu-KothulundeGanamow-Vanavaasama(If one resorts to a cave in a sadhu&#8217;s garb, will he become a rishi? Monkeys live in forests. Are they invanavasa?)The driving motive in people is to gain a  high social status. This desire often leads them to nefarious and despicable activities.  In &#8220;Sarijesi-Veduga,&#8221; the Theevravahini kirtana he contrasts the position occupied by the deceitful and righteous persons.Kokka-Sastra-ViduluNara-SannuticheGoppa-BahumatulaNanderayyaChakkaganu Bhakti-Sastra-VidulaChaala Gani-Navveru(The one who is an expert in  sexual service and indulges in flattery, gains people&#8217;s appreciative acclaim; the one who has mastery over devotional literature becomes the laughing stock).In &#8220;Gattiga-Nanu&#8221; in Begada, Tyagaraja finds fault with Rama:Teppunaingita-MerugagaMeppuna-KaasincheYa-Chappani PrabhuvolaKadavunu-Trippata-Leelara.(Rama! Why did you not warn me that I should not be hanging around worthless wealthy persons).In the Nilambari kriti &#8220;Neeke-Dayaraka&#8221; is his wise observation:Meppulakai-BahuDharmamu-JesiteMigula-Brova-Dagune-Oh! Ragava(If you disburse liberal donations in order to gain praise, will God save you?)To cap it all, Tyagaraja also admits his helplessness and exclaims (Sataleni&#8211;Dinamulu, Naganandini).Kalilona&#8211;Pratama&#8211;PaadamuloTalli-Tandri-Guru-BhaktiyulekaPalumaru&#8211;Dushkrityam&#8211;Bonarpa Valena(Should it happen that even at the first quarter of Kaliyuga people should indulge in despicable acts and let go respect to father, mother and guru?)In despair Tyagaraja wails (&#8216;Rama-Rama-Govinda&#8217; in raga Sowrashtram):Kaliyuga&#8211;ManjulakuNeeku&#8211;MahaatmyamuGaladu&#8211;Ledane&#8211;KaalamaayegaThe time has come in the Kaliyuga for people to doubt whether you have power to stem the tide or not. In agony, he  asks in the kirtana, &#8220;Evaryna-Lera&#8221; in Siddhasena.Kali&#8211;MaanavaadamulaKaaryamulKama-MatsaraadulaKrityamulChala-ChittamuleniVaaripuduChala-TyagarajaNutunito-TelupaIs there not one righteous person to convey to Sri Rama, worshipped by Sri Tyagaraja, the depraved conduct of people actuated by infatuation, information, arrogance and demeaning behaviour?A firm Rama Bhakta, Tyagaraja refuses even to think about the incompetence of his ishta-deivata in punishing the wicked.  In the Durbar song, &#8220;Edinee-Baahubala-Parakrama,&#8221; he reminds Rama in these words.Varasatappu-BuddhuluNeechulakuVachchinad&#8211;TeliyadaVerapuleka-TirigeruChaalanuchuVegame-Tyagaraja-Sannuta(Are you not aware that lowly men indulging in wicked deeds are everywhere? Show your prowess and strike them down soon.)It is akin to the way we, helpless today, throw up our hands saying &#8220;God alone can help us.&#8221;
