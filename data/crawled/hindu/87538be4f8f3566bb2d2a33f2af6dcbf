VThe ethereal space over the southern banks of the Cauvery at Srirangam was fully charged with the strains of Sampradaya music for 12 days recently, with musicians of different age groups offering their obeisance  to Lord Rama.The Sringeri Sankara Math open-air theatre complex was the venue for  the annual sangeetha mahotsavam, which coincided with  Vasantha Navarathri (Vardhanthi  of the present  head, Sri Bharathi Theertha Swamigal). Perhaps the presence of  a large number of connoisseurs from all over Tiruchi and Srirangam, inspired  Priya Sisters to give their best  and the listeners too enjoyed the excellent and perfect modulation.  Commencing with a  brisk varnam, `Evvari Bhodana,' they quickly went through `Thathvam Ariya Tharama' and `Sri Ranganathude' with  aesthetic sensibility.After  the senior Priya gave glimpses of the raga Sahana,  both displayed  the bhava in full form for Dikshitar's `Sri Kamalambikaiai.'Presenting  Mohana Kalyani  with all the lyrical tenderness, they took the audience to dizzy heights by singing Harikesanallur's soul-stirring,  `Bhuvaneswariye Nena Manasare' followed by  swaraprastaras.Thepiece de resistanceof their kutcheri was the elevating elucidation of Thodi  by the elder sister  and both of them  presented Tyagaraja's `Karuna Joodavamma.'Not content with the devotionally enunciated sahitya phrases, the duo went on to delineate the third charanam phrase, `Parasakthi Nayoka Chittamu... '  with niraval and  impressive swaras.Delightful alapanaStarting with the Hamsadhwani varnam, `Jalajakshi,' Neyveli Santhanagopalan sang `Thathvamariya,' `Kripa Joochutaku'  (Chaya Tarangini) and briefly gave the Purvikalyani alapana in which he delighted the listeners with `Gnanamu Chakaradha.' Equally fascinating was his slow  rendering of Tyagaraja's composition, `Giripai Nelakonna Ramuni Guri Thappaka' fully echoing and enunciating  Tyagaraja's prayer and sentiments.Rudrapatnam Brothers took off on a rather sedate note and gained momentum slowly.  They presented a sampradhaya sankeertanam with versatility and pristine purity. The alapana of raga Nayaki by the junior was simply superb and both combined in perfect resonance when they rendered  Dikshitar's `Ranganayakam Bhavaye.' The 12th day concert commenced with a flute recital  by Sikkil Mala Chandrashekar.   She rendered a Kalyani raga alapana followed by `Nidhi Chala Sukhama.'   Her delineation of Kharaharapriya  was unusually fast  but she amply compensated for it while playing the sahityam for  `Chakkani Raja'.  `Bhajare Guru Manasa,' a composition of Sri Bharthi Theertha Swamigal in Abheri was another item she rendered. A student of the Bangalore Engineering College and a member of the Thathachariar family in Srirangam, Aishwarya Vidhya Ragunath has all the promise of emerging  as a top class vocalist. Her  brief elucidation of  Panthuvarali for  `Appa! Rama Bhakti Entho... ' was impressive.Touching devotionalsGayathri Venkataraghavan  dedicated her concert to  Sri Rama,  except for  two compositions, `Sringeri Nayaki Sri Sharadha Devi' in Arabhi and `Sri Saradambam Baje' in  Khamas.  Her  soul-stirring devotionals  touched the hearts of the listeners.U.P. Raju and Nagamani presented on the mandolin, `Viriboni,' `Raghunayaka,' `Guruleka,' a Mallari in Gambiranattai, `Ninnu Nera Namminanu,' `Anuraghamule,'  `Nagumomu' and the lilting `Raghuvamsa.'Sathur Sisters' performance was ecstatic and  pleasant. Most of the songs rendered by them were devoted befittingly to Lord Rama.Tiruchi K. Ramesh sang a Ritigowla alapana followed by his emotional presentation of `Nannu Vidachi Kadalakura'. Precision that marked the alapana (Saveri), sahitya and the swaraprastara for `Rama Bana' showed hard work.G.Ganesh, disciple of Maharajapuram Santhanam, chose unusual compositions.  The Thodi alapana stood out for its raga lakshana  and he appropriately chose `Dasarathi'  of Tyagaraja.Bottom Template Starts
