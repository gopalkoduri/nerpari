VAccessing the venue at the interior of East Abhiramapuram was a task in the lashing rains despite the directions given by the organisers, Brhaddhvani and Rasayana. The aesthetically furnished flat was the chamber where R. Parthasarathy was to give a concert.The gathering was, in fact,\u000ajust handful and a few arrived\u000alittle late and wet including\u000athe accompanists. The arrangement\u000aof acoustics (conceivably\u000aelaborate for a\u000achamber concert) took some\u000amore time.R. Parthasarathy, after his\u000atutelage under his father\u000aRaghavan, who belonged to\u000athe school of Cheranmadevi\u000aSubramanya Sastri, developed\u000aa style of his own fully\u000ainfluenced by the `exception\u000aal gayaki' technique of S. Balachander.\u000aParthasarathy\u000acarries remarkable film industry\u000acredentials by playing almost\u000ain all orchestras of the\u000apopular music directors of the\u000aSouth. His complete control\u000aover the instrument is\u000aincredible.Parthasarathy conciliated\u000athe rain goddess by opening\u000ahis recital with Dikshitar's\u000a`Anandamritakarshini' in raga\u000aAmritavarshini. A rain of swaras\u000awas an add-on to the steady\u000aoffering of the kriti.\u000aAnandabhairavi followed with\u000aa tanam, a speciality of veena\u000aand the composition here was\u000a`Sama Gana Priye' of Periaswami\u000aThooran. The alapana,\u000atanam and kriti were rendered\u000aat a leisurely pace emphasis-\u000aAccessing the venue at the\u000ainterior of East Abhiramapuram\u000awas a task in the\u000alashing rains despite the directions\u000agiven by the organisers,\u000aBrhaddhvani and\u000aRasayana. The aesthetically\u000afurnished flat was the chamber\u000awhere R. Parthasarathy\u000awas to give a concert.\u000aThe gathering was, in fact,\u000ajust handful and a few arrived\u000alittle late and wet including\u000athe accompanists. The arrangement\u000aof acoustics (conceivably\u000aelaborate for a\u000achamber concert) took some\u000amore time.\u000aR. Parthasarathy, after his\u000atutelage under his father\u000aRaghavan, who belonged to\u000athe school of Cheranmadevi\u000aSubramanya Sastri, developed\u000aa style of his own fully\u000ainfluenced by the `exceptioning\u000athe exotic nuances of the\u000araga. Being a chamber concert,\u000aParthasarathy preferred\u000ato try something unusual.\u000aThe fourth copper string representing\u000athe `anu mantra\u000asthayi' in the veena was also\u000aset to madyama sruti and\u000asome abysmally base sancharas\u000awere attempted for the\u000anext raga Hindolam. Dikshitar's\u000azestful `Govardhana Gireesam'\u000awas his pick here.Brisk presentationOne could easily relate Parthasarathy's\u000aplaying to the\u000alate maestro S. Balachander's\u000aas he brought forth the over\u000astressed gayaki style characteristic\u000aof the veteran almost\u000ain similar, amazing fashion.\u000aThis did sound endurable in\u000athe lower regions but the extra\u000apull to elicit many notes in\u000athe upper registers proved to\u000abe an over kill. Veena sounds\u000asoothing and serene with delicate\u000atouches than with persuasive\u000apluck or pull.A brisk and bright `Nenarunchi\u000aNanu' in Malavi was\u000athe filler between Anandabhairavi\u000aand Hindolam. Kalyani,\u000athe raga of the evening,\u000acame as a blend of smooth\u000aand staccato phrasings. The\u000aquirky jumps thrown in between\u000athe free and fluid raga\u000aflow added a queer zing to the\u000aalapana. The tanam here was\u000aextended, enjoyable and exhilarating.\u000aThe experimenting\u000aof sruti bedam was also\u000atouched upon in the raga alapana\u000ato add more spice.Tyagaraja's `Nidhichala\u000aSukhama' was played with\u000aconsiderable reverence. The\u000aniraval and swaras at the\u000apoint `Mamatha Bandana'\u000acompleted the exercise. B.\u000aGanapathyraman and S. Karthick\u000aon the mridangam and\u000aghatam respectively, sounded\u000ain a subdued tenor with an\u000aaim to highlight the sound of\u000athe veena.Small room space crowded\u000awith furniture and loudspeakers,\u000avideo recording\u000aman blocking the view and\u000adistractions by late entrants\u000amarred the otherwise enjoyable\u000arecital.
