VIndian Classical Music, be it the Hindustani or Carnatic, if rendered well in relaxed fashion is sure to enhance sensitive listening pleasure.The gradual building up of alaaps of raags as practised by the Hindustani musicians would do well to be emulated by their Carnatic counterparts without deviating from Carnatic musical values. Raga essays are the acid test for musicians of both the systems and form the crux of Indian classical music.The rasika&#8217;s satisfaction can reach sublime levels by listening to raga vinyasas when offered with perfect sruti alignment and with a good understanding of what constitutes the life of a melody, for which one has to have an insight beyond the mere scales of the melodies.Rajat Prasanna is a highly talented flautist in the Hindustani mode whose compact disc titled, &#8220;Hidden Gems,&#8221; has been released by Mystica Music P Ltd. Rajat successfully showcases his talent and expertise in his handling of two beautiful melodies, Bihagra and Madhuwanti. The artiste&#8217;s blowing is strong and powerful and the thick and thin shades are aptly present at the right places. This is reflective of the  intenseriyaz(sadhakam) put in by the flautist.The disc opens with a leisurely stage by stage alaap of Bihagra, which is close to Harikhambodi, though the usage of the Kakalinishada is also employed in Bihagra.Rajath avoids unnecessary frills judiciously in his exposition of the raag. A delectable rendition of Madhuwanti follows which has the quality of a soothing balm for aching muscles. Rajath caresses the jeeva swaras of the melody with his perfect understanding and has cajoled the melody to present itself in its fullest glory.The alaap  is a fine portrait. Madhuwanti is a raag which is fairly popular amongst Carnatic music buffs  due to the popularity of lyricist Vaali&#8217;s composition &#8220;Kanda Naal Mudalai Kaadal Perugudadi&#8221; delightfully tuned by the late S. Kalyanaraman. The short compositions played by Rajath in both the raags are appealing. Unobtrusive and precise rythmic support on the tabla has been provided by Nawab Khan. Rajath is an artiste to be heard often.Mystica Music P ltdRajat PrasannaHindustani CD &#8211; Flute (Price: Rs. 195)
