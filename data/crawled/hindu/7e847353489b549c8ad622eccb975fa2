VThe CD (MP3) titled Panniru Tirumurai -1 comprises select verses from the works of the Saiva leaders Appar, Gnanasambandar, Sundarar.The Odhuvarmurthys who have sung these in traditional panns have been drawn from various temples, including Ku. Subramanian (Tiruparamkundram), Pon. Mu. Muthukumaran (Madurai), Kumaara. Swaminathan (Karur), Mu. Sundar (Karivalamvandanallur), Thi. Balachandiran (Vayalur) and So. Sivakumar (Mayiladuthurai).The 21 verses have either been presented individually or as a group.Popular and rareVeterans that they are, the odhuvarmurthys have done full justice to the songs. Choosing 21 from the available 18,326 Tirumurai verses sung by 27 devotees of Lord Siva (Sivanadiyargal) should have been a mind boggling task for the producers. Yet they have to be commended for having given a mixture of both popular and rare Tirumurai verses.The first of Tirugnanasambandar's Thevaram &#8220;Thodudaya Seviyan&#8221; sung by him as soon as he was fed with divine milk at the Sirkazhi temple pond is presented emotionally.&#8220;Pitha Pirai Soodi&#8221; and &#8220;Pala Pala&#8221; are the other hymns sung with emotion.Another gem in this collection is from Manikkavachagar's Tiruvachakam &#8220;Vaanagi.&#8221;Listening to this collection will for sure transport devotees to the precincts of Siva temples.The accompanists, whose names do not figure in the credits, have embellished the renderings thereby enhancing the listening pleasure.The producers have also released another MP3 CD covering selections from Tiruppugazh, Kandar Anubhoothi and Kandar Alankaram with the same group singing them.
