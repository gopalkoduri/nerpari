VMadurai T.N Seshagopalan provided music lovers of Thrissur an evening of melody and rhythm. The energy  displayed by this veteran artiste was impressive.The opening &#8216;Viriboni&#8217; varnam in Bhairavi was a case in point. With innovations in rhythm, he effortlessly traversed the lower notes with a masterly touch. The chittaswarams ended with a burst of notes that was matched to perfection by the violin.&#8216;Gamganapathaye Namo Nama&#8217; in Hamsadhwani had the niraval at &#8216;Pankajasena&#8217; and this Dikshitar composition was embellished with westernised note-patterns in the manodharma section. Essaying into the characteristic scales of the Khamas raga, the alapana was  full-bodied and as formal in form and structure as the kriti. The violin accompaniment  ushred in the Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Sujana Jeevana.&#8217; The artiste placed his mark on the kriti by his proficient niraval and innovation in using a delayed rhythm pattern.&#8216;Marukela ra O Raghava,&#8217; the popular Tyagaraja composition in raga Jayanthasri, was sprightly. Seshagopalan began the Navagraha kriti &#8216;Budham Ashrayami&#8217; in Natakurinji with a sombre slokam. He presented a piece in Kanakangi before moving on to the major Kalyani raga of the concert.The ragam tanam pallavi  routine predominantly occupied the higher notes. The smooth glide and the excellent brighas gave character to the delineation of this Melakartha raga. He made a daring foray into Suddhadhanyasi using shrutibhedam and came back to the base raga effortlessly. There were plenty of Druta sangatis and the aarohanam and the avarohanam made frequent appearances in the manodharma. The scales from the Kalyani varnam were also presented in an innovative way.The well known Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Neethi Sala Sukhama&#8217; made a grand entry after this elaborate introduction.  Seshagopalan is known for his keen interest in instrumental music.  He used it to his advantage by mimicking the staccato of the mridangam in his vocal presentation.Chanaganassery B. Harikumar kept up the energetic pace of the vocals by his brilliant performance on the mridangam. The taniavarthanam between  Harikumar and morsing player Payyanur Govinda Prasad was mutually competitive and enjoyable.  After this detailed and expressive recital of the main raga, the ragamalika came as a bit of an anticlimax.The audience was not yet out of the mood created by Kalyani. Des, Atana, Chandrajyothi, Begada, Shyama, Saveri, Revathy and other ragas made brief bows and disappeared before the audience could appreciate them.The Kabirdas bhajan &#8216;Ramabhajan Kyon Chod Diya&#8217; in Shubapantuvarali made a caustic comment on the human condition that foregoes not pride or greed but dispenses with prayers.The next item, a tillana in raga Behag, was rhythmic and contained tightly packed scales. &#8216;Makula Nunnakiha&#8217; in Suruti took the concert to its closing moments.The Mangalam, set to Pantuvarali with a shift to Sree, ended a memorable performance.Seshagopalan was at his  masterly best during this concert. Attukal Balasubramaniam provided able support on the violin. The concert was organised by Rasikapriya Trust.
