VMusicians from different branches of music, ranging from folk to Hindustani, paid rich tributes to the late Kathakali singer Kalamandalam Sankaran Embranthiri.&#8216;Embranthiri Sangeetholsavam,&#8217; a two-day music festival,  was organised at Irinjalakuda,  to commemorate the birth anniversary of Embranthiri.The pathos of Nandanar was unfurled as Sreevalsan J. Menon rendered &#8216;Sattrevilakiyiru pillai,&#8217; a Gopalakrishna Bharathi composition in Poorvikalyani, in which Nandanar requests the bull to move aside as it was blocking hisdarshanof  the Lord of Chidambaram.A neat essay of Kharaharapriya was followed by  &#8216;Soumithri,&#8217; a rarely heard kriti of Tyagaraja. He concluded the concert with &#8216;Madhava Murahara,&#8217; a Kathakali padam from &#8216;Kirmeeravadham&#8217; that was popularised by Embranthiri.  Edappally Ajithkumar (violin), G. Chandrasekharan Nair (mridangam) and Manjoor Unnikrishnan (ghatam) were the accompanying artistes.Rupasree Das&#8217;  Hindustani bhajans in Peelu, Puriya dhanasri and Malkhauns were well received by the audience. This was followed by a sitar recital by Manab Das, a lecturer in the Goa College of Music. A disciple of  Indranil Banerjee, Manab  belongs to the Maihar gharana. He chose Keeravani, a raga taken from South Indian system of music, as the main piece.   His  command  over the instrument was evident as he  glided effortlessly through three octaves. He followed it up with a serene bhajan in Bhairav. Ulhas K. Velingker gave excellent support on the tabla.Kottakkal Madhu&#8217;s concert saw him redefining the format of the ashtapadi &#8216;Manjuthara kunjathala,&#8217; usually sung during the melappadam, by adapting it for the Carnatic style by employing the Misra jhamba tala in four kalais.  He opened the concert with thodayam and concluded with an item akin to a tillana, which had the cholkettus of kalasams in Kathakali that were penned by P.S.Warrier, founder of Kottakkal Aryavaidya Sala.An erudite rendition of sublime Naattakurinji, which was  succeeded by the kriti  &#8216;Budhamaasrayami&#8217;  brought forth the musician in T.M. Krishna. The manodharma swaras rendered for this was perfectly  in tandem with the pace of the kriti. A detailed alaapana of Shanmukhapriya  was followed by thaanam and pallavi. To it was tagged  raagamalika swaras in Sahana, Saranga and Kappi.The meditative mood build up by the Bagesri kriti &#8216;Saagara sayana vibho,&#8217;  which was sung at a much slower pace than envisaged by the composer MDR himself, &#8216;Pibhare raama rasam&#8217; (Aahir bhairav) and &#8216;Thunga theera&#8217;  was marred by the racy concluding tillana in Poornashadjam.V.V. Ramanamoorthy&#8217;s delicate touches and strokes on the mridangam elevated the level of the concert and his korvais and nadais showed his mastery over the rhythm. T.H. Subramanian (violin) and B.S. Purushotham (ganjira) were the other accompanists.&#8216;Nalacharitha Sangeethika&#8217; featured duos singing  select verses from the play &#8216;Nalacharitham.&#8217;   Veterans Kalamandalam Gangadharan and P.D. Namboodiri participated in a concert of Kathakalipadams.Concerts focussing on Ashtapadi, Krishnattapadams, Brahmanipaattu, Kalamezhuthupaattu, folk and indigenous music, and Kaikottikali were some of the other events that were featured in the fete. The crowning glory was the staging of  a Kathakali play that featured many of the top artistes.
