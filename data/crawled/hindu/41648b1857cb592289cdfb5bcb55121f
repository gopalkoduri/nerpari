VSumitra Vasudev&#8217;s vocal concert for Charsur Arts Foundation at Raga Sudha Hall endorsed the fact that here is an emerging musician of commendable quality. Sumitra&#8217;s tradition-bound offering demonstrated her rigorous training under the guidance of her illustrious guru  R. Vedavalli.In this concert, the central piece Khambodi created an aura of sanctity and beauty with Sumitra&#8217;s well conceived raga essay mounted with Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Navavarnam Kamalambikayai&#8217; set to Ata Talam.It is well known that Khambodi unravels many of its power-packed prayogas only in the tara sthayi sancharas; Sumitra assiduously developed the raga to match the grandeur of the composition. Some of her phrases in the tara sthayi were not only awe-inspiring but also extremely graceful. This navavarnam is set at the right tempo and the niraval on &#8216;Sagala Sowbhagyadaya Kamboja Charanaayai&#8217; was meticulous and the swara strands not overstretched.The pensive Mukhari interlude (&#8216;Endraikku Siva Padam&#8217;) was sandwiched between two vibrant numbers &#8216;Arunachala Natham&#8217; in Saranga and &#8216;Seethamma Mayamma&#8217; in Lalitha (According to authentic sources, it has to be in Lalitha and not in Vasantha as popularly sung!) thus keeping the concert on an even keel.Can Mohanam sound romantic, even through sedate reposeful phrases just dressed up with a few rounds of brigas? Yes, it can. Sumitra&#8217;s Mohanam was one such interpretation for another Dikshitar number, &#8216;Kadamabari Priyayai&#8217;, with niraval on &#8216;Maduryavak Prada Nipunayai. The kalpanaswaras here carried special allure when the finale was structured with swara lines edging onga, pa, da, saand upper registerrimarching to a well configured finale.The starters were the less-heard Kharaharapriya varnam of Mudicondan Venkatarama Iyer and popular &#8216;Meru Samana&#8217; in Mayamalavagowla of Tyagaraja. The concert ended with the sedate &#8216;Yamike&#8217; of Jayadeva in Ahiri and speedy Arunagirinadar Thiruppugazh in Hamsanandi.Amritha Murali is an accompanying artist who can adapt herself easily.Her violin versions of ragas such as Mohanam, Mukhari and Khambodi were proof of her deep understanding of the style of Sumitra. Such support is a plus point to the concert&#8217;s quality.So was the case with the rhythmic duo B. Sivaraman and Madipakkam A. Murali. Their subtle intrusion through finer beats added value.Their tani avartanam in ata talam was yet another credit for their expertise.Nandini Sharma Anand&#8217;s vocal concert for Naada Inbam, was a diligently planned, well executed event. Nandini&#8217;s pleasing voice, subtle delivery and efforts focused on educing the image of the raga succinctly as well as in detail, well modulated articulation are certainly favourable factors for a music lover.Sahana raga has the merit of extreme benevolent tenor and Nandini judiciously employed her knowledge in such a way that there was poignancy even in her brief alapana. &#8216;E Vasudani&#8217; of Tyagaraja with its catchy chittaswaram provided a good forerunner for a concert that was melodic and matured.A few rounds of niraval at the uncommon &#8216;Kovuri Sundaresa&#8217; and the swara added here gave lustre to the kriti. The stimulating &#8216;Na Jeevadara&#8217; in Bilahari of Tyagaraja, through its fine cascading sangatis, proved to be a worthy interlude.Pantuvarali could be strident or majestic. But Nandini Sharma specially created a soulful but energetic ambience with her raga essay followed by Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Aparama Bakthi.&#8217; The extensions and swaras for &#8216;Tripatalanu Nilpi Kanti&#8217; were worked out within limits.&#8216;Ninnadanela&#8217; in Kanada was the fast prelude to the Bhairavi exposition. The traditional phrases reiterating the archaic appeal of the raga was eloquently brought out by Nandini in her not so long but acceptable alapana segment. The brevity was justified because the choice of the kriti was Syama Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Sari Evvaramma.&#8217; It is a well known fact that Syama Sastri&#8217;s compositions could cast the nuances of the raga in every way.Nandini nurtured them well in her delivery of this kriti. Her indulgence on niraval at &#8216;Paramapavani Devi&#8217; cruised through gentleness integrated into aesthetics. Swarakalpana was given due credit here with swara strains connected with professional grace.Nandini&#8217;s best quality is that she seems to intentionally leave something for the listener to ruminate instead of flooding him with extra fringes. It is indeed a very intelligent approach. The Jayakumars on the violin and mridangam  provided able  support.The concluding part had room for &#8216;Maha Devamanohari,&#8217; in  ragamalika  ending as Manohari, a composition of Nandini&#8217;s guru Suguna Purushothaman and the famous Yamuna Kalyani tillana of Lalgudi Jayaraman.
