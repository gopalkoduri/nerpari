VAarabhi is a possibly one-of-a-kind centre for performing arts which is an exclusive violin institute that imparts training to children on the bow instrument to children. The training methodology and techniques is pure classical base and is taught by\u000a accomplished violinist Ashok Gurjale.On July 16, Ashok introduced onstage his two nephews and disciples, Anirudh and Abhijit Gurjale, for a duet performance on the violin. Students of IIT-Madras, they both started with a Navaragamalika varnam.The brothers showed their skill on the instrument by choosing apt ragas for the evening. The varnam was followed byVatapi Ganapathimin Hamsadvani. The next composition wasBrova Baramain Bahudari, where the boys slipped on the rhythm on quite a few occasions; however the senior mridangam accompanist managed, adjusted and guided the young artistes.The alap in Kalyani ragam was rather long and repetitive, but they showed their creative skills in presentation, especially the swaras. Anirudh and Abhijit also ably sangMarugelarain Jayantisri, followed by a Sai bhajan.They went on to perform a tillana composed by Lalgudi Jayaraman in Mand and concluded the show withRaghupati Raghava Rajaram. The artistes were accompanied by P. Ramachandra Sarma on the mridangam, S.T.P. Vijay Sarathy on the ghatam, and Jay Kumar Acharya on kanjira and morsing. Thetani avartanam(solo) by the percussionists was good and it was a pleasant surprise to hearkonakolu, the art of orally rendering the rhythm, by Jay Kumar Acharya, which has almost been forgotten in Carnatic recitals these days.Inspite of few lapses on the part of the boys in ragam and talam, it was heartening to note that the two youngsters are keeping the Carnatic music tradition alive.
