VAthmanandamBrindavan AudiosNavarajakulamMuthucumaraswamyCarnatic classical-Vocal (CD)Price not mentionedBrindavan Audios has recorded the vocal concert of Navarajakulam Muthucumaraswamy, a disciple of  Mudicondan Venkataramier and Sandhyavandanam Srinivasa Rao. Her talent was honed by D. K. Jayaraman. She has held prestigious posts in the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, and was the first Tamil broadcaster to be awarded the Commonwealth Relations Trust Scholarship.Beginning with "Vinayaka" in Hamsadhwani, the artiste elaborates Mayamalavagowla in a sober fashion eschewing the irrelevant.Detailed alapana"Vidulaku" of Tyagaraja has two `patantarams', the Nayina Pillai School and the other belonging to the Umayalpuram tradition. The vocalist's version is according to the former. The interpretations of "Vidulaku" and Mysore Vasudevachar's "Ra Ra Rajeeva Lochana" (Mohanam) pass muster.A Tamizh composition in Pantuvarali, by Ku. Sa. Krishnamurthi, is the filler before a detailed alapana of Madhyamavati.Mullaivasal Chandramouli's (violin) expansion was enjoyable with many of the time honoured phrases showcased creditably. Shyama Sastri's "Palimchu Kamakshi" and the swara passages reflect an enthusiastic mind and sincere approach to the art of Carnatic music. Kalakkad Srinivasan (mridangam), Tiruchi Murali (ghatam) and A.S. Krishnan (morsing) with their sensitive accompanying skills and a flawless tani avartanam contribute in good measure to maintain the momentum. Inuvil N. Veeramani Iyer's "Karpagavalli" and Bharatiyar's "Payum Oli," both in the form of ragamalika, and a lilting Thaalaatu in Pahadi complete the agenda.``Panchapuranam" is another album in which Muthucumaraswamy has rendered Thevaram, Thiru Isai Pa, Tiruvachagam, Pallandu and Thirupuranam with devotional fervour.S.
