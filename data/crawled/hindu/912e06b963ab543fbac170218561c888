VJeyaraaj and Jaysri are known for their chaste rendition with the accent on gamakam linked with melody. Their 90-minute concert offered a serene insight into some of the great compositions of Dikshitar on Goddess Devi which normally do not make appearance in concerts.Shanmukhapriya known as Chamaram in Dikshitar School was main piece  with an elaborate ragam by Jeyaraaj supported by ragamalika tanam in Saveri, Atana, Bageshri and Saranga shared by Jaysri. The raga spread was dotted with fine phrases exclusive for Chamaram  and progressed at a leisurely pace. To compensate, the Abhayamba Vibakthi dyana kriti &#8220;Sadasraye abhayambike swiftly moved in Rupaka talam with energetic swara sallies.Jaysri&#8217;s tender but firm outline of Kedaragowla for the &#8220;Neelothpalambhikayai&#8221; and the alternating rendition of the lyrics vocally added special effect to the playing. The duo opened their concert with &#8220;Ekambresa nayike&#8221; in Karnataka Suddha Saveri and closed with the inimitable &#8220;Maaye tvam yahi&#8221; in Tarangini.Trivandrum Hariharan kept the tempo of the concert on mridangam with poise. Revathi Sadasivam, another alumni of the vidhyalaya started her recital with &#8220;Guni janathi nutha&#8221; in Gurjari by Dikshitar. Revathi&#8217;s pull and moves on the frets were executed with confidence not forsaking the aesthetics of the instrument. Sriranjani a colourful and sparkling melody enveloped the audience pleasantly through Revathi&#8217;s precise raga alapana, &#8220;Parvatha raja kumari&#8221;  and a rain of swaras at the end. Gamakakriya was her choice for the major elaboration for the celebrated &#8220;Meenakshi memudam.&#8221; Her swara sequence sans niraval at &#8220;Madhurapuri nilaye&#8221; made a good supplement to the fine rendition of the kriti.Revathi introduced two quick numbers &#8220;Sri sheethalambam&#8221; in Vasantha, a composition of Ananthakrishna Iyer the founder of the school and &#8220;Simhasanasthithey&#8221; a mangalam in ragamalika. For percussion it was again Trivandrum Hariharan who supported creditably.It should be mentioned that veena concerts are rare in sabhas and find less patronage from the audience notwithstanding the fact that it is a musical instrument which is not only divine but also very versatile. This musical vehicle provides extraordinary grace to the compositions of the Trinity reflecting the emotion, devotion and distinction of classical music. The finale to the series came with  young Veena Venkataramani playing to the percussion of Ramkumar another youngster. &#8220;Ekathandam&#8221; in Bilahari, &#8220;Kanja dalaya dakshi&#8221; in Kamalamanohari and &#8220;Saraswathi vidhiyuvathi&#8221; in Hindolam were her selections.
