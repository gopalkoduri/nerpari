VB.N.S. Murali sang under the aegis of Ganabharathi. With him, also sang two young artistes, Phanish and Pavan. Three singers on the move in a customary concert was something that exposed the listeners to a new experience.The voices enriched and fortified overall resonance and tonal depth by complementing themselves; at the same time however; this concert restricted the singers from exposing their full potentials to the complete satisfaction of the audience.The lyrical sections of all the presentations emerged with full grandeur, and the manner in which they recited them commanded unreserved appreciation, for the clarity and the diction they displayed.Further, the singers adapted appropriate paces suitable for the nature of lyrics so that the accents were in no way jeopardized in spite of the chorus singing. However, in this collective effort, the emotions of the compositions were diminished and the exercise seemed far from being advantageous. Karur Devudu Iyer's &#8220;Saami Ninne Koriyunnanu&#8221; in Shri raga and Swathi Tirunal's &#8220;Deva Deva Kalayami Te&#8221; in Mayamalavagoula (the latter with an absorbing neraval at &#8220;Jaatarupa Nibhachela&#8221; and equally acceptable swarakalpana) late made way for an alapana in Devagandhari prefacing Dikshitar's &#8220;Kshitijaramana&#8221;. Succinct alapana sufficiently revealed Murali's consistent voice: melodious, resilient and expansive.Nevertheless, alapana in Vachaspati (&#8220;Kantajudumi&#8221; - Thyagaraja) had marginal discrepancies in shruthi, and the fast bhirkas by one of the co-singer's was not all that pleasing, in contrast to the lyrical section and neraval at &#8220;Alanaadu Soumitri&#8221; imaginatively expanded. Scholarly swarakalpana was another phase denoting another successful area of the concert.The focus of the concert - raga, tana and pallavi (&#8220;Kripaakari Dayaakari Chamundeshwari&#8221; in Bhairavi) reached its peak in swarakalpana imaginatively hemmed in Shahana, Hindola, Behag, Jog and Madhyamavati. This number also evinced a well-improvised tani avarthana by the percussionists &#8212; M.R. Manjunath (mridanga- composed) and Ramanujam (morsing - wondrous). The melody accompanist, H.S. Thandava Murthy (violin) admirably harmonised with the styles of all the three singers.The concert included other numbers like Vasudevachar's &#8220;Ramaramana&#8221; (Nagaswaravali), Muthayya Bhagavathar's &#8220;Sarasamukhi&#8221; (Goudamalhar) and so on.
