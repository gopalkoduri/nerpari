VHaving been under the tutelage of Tiruvarur N.S.Chandra Sekharan and Mumbai V. Vamanan, her foundation seems quite strong.She has enriched her repertoire by receiving specialised training for &#8216;pasurams&#8217; under the late M.N.Venkatavaradhan.She began with &#8216;Agara Mudhala Ezhuthellam&#8217; from Thirukkural,  suitable for Tamizhisai Sangam, and concluded her concert with &#8216;Shanthi Nilava Vendum&#8217; by Sethu Madhava Rao, paying homage to Gandhi, as the programme was held at Mahatma Gandhi Mandapam.Many of the great composers of Tamil were featured in her concert. She sang &#8216;Arul Puri Aingarane&#8217; in Saraswathi and &#8216;Thanigai Valar Saravanabhava&#8217; in Thodi (both by Papanasam Sivan), taking the latter as the centrepiece.Gopalakrishna Bharatiar&#8217;s &#8216;Thiruvadi Charanam&#8217; in Khambodi and Syama Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Enneramum Un Namam&#8217; in Purvikalyani were presented elaborately. The compositions of the Sirkazhi Moovar, &#8216;Sevikka Vendumayya&#8217; (Andolika-Muthu Thandavar), &#8216;Kaalai Thookki&#8217; (Yadukulakhambodi -Marimutha Pillai) and &#8216;Yaaro Ivar Yaaro&#8217; (Bhairavi-Arunachalakkavirayar) were delightful. She carefully remembered to include Kamban, (&#8216;Anjile Onru Petraan) and Bharati, (&#8216;Engirundho Vandhaan&#8217;). (She could have included Ilango also).Sundaramurthy Nayanar&#8217;s Thevaram &#8216;Neela Ninaindhadiyen&#8217; in Panthuvarali and the famous pasurams of the three Azhwars, &#8216;Vaiyam Thagazhiya,&#8217; &#8216;Anbe Thagazhiya&#8217; and &#8216;Thirukkanden Pon Meni Kanden&#8217; were presented after an appropriate introduction.&#8216;Thullumadha Velkai,&#8217; a Thiruppugazh, and the tillana in Khamas by Maha Vaidyanatha Iyer gave fulfilment to her concert.Priyadarshini&#8217;s alapanas and swaraprastharas showed that she can impress the initiated rasikas too. But she kept them quite compact and enjoyable. She introduced each song mentioning the raga, tala and composer, and gave more details where necessary.Her perfect pronunciation of Tamil was a pleasant surprise, considering the fact that she was born and brought up in Mumbai. R. Sridhar from New Delhi and R. Raghunath from Bangalore provided good support on the violin and mridangam.
