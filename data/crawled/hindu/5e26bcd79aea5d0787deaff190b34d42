VT.K.GANAPATHYThe annual Tyagaraja Aradhana organised by Thyagabrahma Gananjali was inaugurated at  the Venugopalaswami temple premises in Sullivan Street, Coimbatore, recently.  M. Krishnan of Sree Krishna Sweets presided.   Vaidyanathakrishnan, secretary, presented the annual report.  Krishnan spoke on the greatness and significance of the compositions of the saint-poet.  Vijayalakshmi Subramanian's inaugural vocal recital  provided a wholesome  and pleasant fare of aesthetic inputs to the listeners. The way she nourished the kritis and the ragas with her pliable voice carried the concert to sublime levels. Her sahitya gnanam and choice of songs, coupled with clarity of diction could not have been missed by the rasikas. Her opening `Balakanakamaya' in Ataana began with a fascinating tone and sahitya bhavam.`Kalukunu' in Nayaki, with the artiste's vocal modulation, had a soothing effect. Panthuvarali was elaborated with  pleasing movements in the mantara and tara regions for the kriti, `Siva Siva Enaradha.' Then came `Itisamayamura' in Chaayanaattai.  Mukhari was sketched with sensuous awareness and aesthetic elegance for the kriti, `Entaninne.'The raga delineation of Sankarabharanam for Sundareswaruni was highly imaginative and full of depth and free expression in the higher reaches. `Rama Paah' in Kaapi and `Paahi Rama Rama' in Kharaharapriya were full of aesthetic touches. Murari's lyrical versions of Mukhari and Sankarabharanam were reflective of the style of his father (V.V.Subramaniam). The thani avartanam by Anantakrishnan (mridangam) and Subramaniam (kanjira) was laced with several rhythmic laya patterns.Picture of dignityMelody and chaste diction characterised the bhava-laden vocal recital of Seetha Rajan on the second day.  There was never a dull moment in the kutcheri, for theazhuthamin the recital took the rasikas to ecstatic heights. Her performing style invested the concert with a picture of dignity and refinement. Early on came `Sree Narada' (Kanada) with swaras, followed by `Sudha Madhurya' in Sindhuramakriya. `Elaavathaara' revealed the glossy sheen of Mukhari. The raga vinyasam of Malayamarutham was moored by strong pidis. The kriti was `Manasa Etulo.' Her raga delineation of Madhyamavati for the composition, `Adigisukhamu' was comprehensive with gnana bhava exuding a classical spell.The noteworthy niraval and swaras vouched for concentrated listening. Thepiece de resistanceof the concert was her elaborate alapana of Sahana with weighty sancharas and prayogas, replete with aesthetic impulses which showcased the vocalsit's artistry.The other items included `Seethamma Mayamma' (Vasantha), `Karunai Elakante' (Varali), `Neekedayaraga' (Neelambari) and `Adugaradhana' (Manoranjani). Sanjeev's solo versions portrayed neatly and mellifluously the cohesive designs of Mukhari, Malayamarudham and Sahana. Skandasubramaniam (mridangam) and Murali (ghatam) performed  their laya exercises crisply in an arresting thani.Bottom Template Starts
