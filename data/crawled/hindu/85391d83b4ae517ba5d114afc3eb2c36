VThe rains have always been unpredictable, the science of meteorology notwithstanding. However, some things have remained steadfast down the centuries, and one of these is India's concept of monsoon music. Ragas that bring out the romance of rain are a part of our heritage, and this year, Bunyan Tree Events brings its festival, Barkha Ritu &#151;  Rains and Ragas, to Delhi and other cities. An event that started out in Mumbai, it spread last year to Hyderabad, and this Saturday it gets off the ground as the first all-India Barkha Ritu festival.At FICCI auditoriumThe Capital is the starting point for the festival. The venue is FICCI auditorium. Beginning at 7 p.m., the Delhi leg of the event features the acclaimed vocalist Ustad Rashid Khan and a jugalbandi by sitar exponent Ustad Shujaat Khan and sarod maestro Pandit Tejendra Majumdar.You can track the progress of the rain music as it moves to Mumbai on July 15. Here at the Nehru Centre auditorium, one of India's favourite musicians, Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia, regales listeners with his flute, while Pandit Chhannulal Mishra captures the mood with Hindustani vocal. Renowned for his rendering of dadras, kajris and chaitis, besides thumris, devotional music and Khayal, this popular singer who exemplifies the Purab ang, is an apt choice. The following week Barkha Ritu moves southwards to Hyderabad. Here, the Ravindra Bharati auditorium features a vocal recital by Rashid Khan and a santoor concert by Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma. The Mumbai-based santoor maestro is looking forward to performing in Barkha Ritu. Listening to monsoon ragas while it is drizzling outside enhances the enjoyment of the melody, he feels, and that is why festivals of this nature are popular. But he adds wryly, "I am not talking about the kind of rain we have been having in Mumbai!"The rainmakers return to Maharashtra where Chhannulal Mishra and Shiv Kumar Sharma perform in Pune at the Y.B. Chavan auditorium on 30 July. Further information can be had from Ashish Mago, General Manager  -   Sales and Operations, at 9810141884.Bottom Template Starts
