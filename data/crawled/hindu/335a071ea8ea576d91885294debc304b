VB. RAMADEVIBombay Jayashri's concert at the Rajalakshmi Fine Arts for the September Season was an `araadhana' to Tamil music. With the theme `Azhagae, Thamizhe' she started on a winning spree with the anupallavi of the devout Abhogi krithi by Gopalakrishna Bharathi, `Sabhapathikku veru deivam.'  After a leisurely alapana in Karaharapriya, she presented `Senthil Aandavan' by Papanasam Sivan.  Her `Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi' was set in Mohanam and Kalyana vasantham.'  `Pozhudhu migavachudhe' in Revathi by Ambhujam Krishna was moving.Her honeyed voice, blending with sruti transported the audience.V. V. S. Murari played in a subdued fashion in keeping with the mood of the evening while J. Vaidhyanathan on the mridangam and Trivandrum Rajagopal on the kanjira did their bit to complete the devotional experience.Good crowdO.S. Arun's `Bhajan Sandhya' drew a good crowd. `Vakkundaam,' the famous poem of Avvaiyar, the great devotee of Ganesha, marked the beginning of a sprightly session.He sang quite a few songs on Ganesha and  propitiated Goddess Saraswathi with the shloka, `Ya kundhendhu' with `Veena vaadhini varadhe.' After the virutham `Uruvaay aruvaay' Arun sang `Ninaikkaadha neramillai' on Muruga. `Sakkhi hey, Keshi madhana mudaram,' an ashtapadi of Jayadeva was sung in different ragas and styles. `Yamunai nadhiye kannanai kandaayo?' following `Govinda, madhava' was very appealing.His selection comprised many composers, many languages and many styles.He remembered to render the usual favourites, `Bhagayada lakshmi', and `Mahadeva Shiva Shambho' and `Kurai onrum illai.'`Bhimaha maaruthi' on Anjaneya was brisk and lively. Endowed with a rich voice, with the right mix of Carnatic and Hindustani, O.S. Arun has mastered the art of offering people what they want.His accompanying team consisted of Vijayaraghavan (vioin), Kuldeep Pai (harmonium), Manikandan (mridangam) and Kiran kumar (tabla).Bottom Template Starts
