VA vocal concert by Priya Sisters, Shanmukhapriya and Haripriya, accompanied by M.A. Krishnaswami (violin), Skanda Subramanyan (mridanga) and B.S. Purushotham (kanjira) was part of the Spring Music Festival held recently by the Sri Rama Lalitha Kala Mandira, Bangalore.A brisk beginning was made with the aditala varna in Panthuvarali raga &#8220;Sami Ninne&#8221;, with the Hamsadhwani krithi &#8220;Varanamukha Va&#8221; in rupaka tala, and &#8220;Neeke Theliyaka Pothe&#8221; in Anandabhairavi raga and aditala following in quick succession. A crisp alapana of Begada, replete with raga bhava laden sancharas, prefaced &#8220;Neevera Kuladhanamu&#8221; the Thyagaraja composition in mishra chapu thala, supplemented with kalpana swaras and &#8220;Neepadame Gathi&#8221; in Nalinakanthi raga and rupaka thala.A fairly exhaustive alapana of Purvikalyani and Deekshithar's &#8220;Meenakshi Me Mudam Dehi&#8221;, notable for an ideal kalapramana and clear diction, were next. The neraval at &#8220;Meenalochani Pasamochani&#8221; which threw into sharp focus the beauty of the sahithya and kalpana swaras, were commensurate with the grandeur and gravity of the composition.Madhyamavathi, the main raga, was expanded with a meticulous alapana, tana, and a pallavi beginning &#8220;Palinchu Bhagavathi Shivayuvathi Madhyamavathi&#8221; set to misra jathi triputa tala, an example of the trademark vitality and vividness of the vocalists' style, though an occasional hoarseness of voice was discernible. The ragamalika kalpana swaras in Saramathi, Revathi and Madhuvanthi reverted to the sahithya with an interesting substitution of the respective raga name in place of Madhyamavathi. This was augmented by exemplary melodic and percussive support from the accompanists and culminating in a tani avarthana.Madurai T.N. Seshgopalan, accompanied by V.V.Ravi (violin), K.V. Prasad (mridanga), and Vaikom Gopalakrishnan (ghata), presented the inaugural concert of Kalotsav-2010, organised by the Sree Ramakrishna Bhajana Sabha Trust.The recital commenced with &#8220;Samidayajuda&#8221;, the Kedaragoula varna in aditala, to which were appended several rounds of kalpana swara, and &#8220;Kanakasabhapathi&#8221; in Dhanyasi raga and aditala. The renowned artiste then progressed to a compact alapana of Nagaswaravali, remarkable for its cascade of briga-laden sancharas in the thara sthayi, and &#8216;Sri Sankara Guruvaram' in rupaka thala. The multiple shades of Panthuvarali were illumined in a raga alapana that was also replete with brigas in the higher octave, punctuated with spontaneous smooth glides and long pauses at crucial junctures. The Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Sivasivayanarada&#8221; in adi thala was suffixed with a neraval at &#8220;Agamamula Nuthiyinchi&#8221;, and the ensuing kalpana swaras ended with a fascinating focus on the madhya sthayi and tara sthayi gandharas.A brief elaboration of Shanmukhapriya preceded the adi thala composition &#8220;Tandai Tai&#8221;, rendered with deep emotional appeal. &#8220;Yarukku Than Theriyum&#8221; in Devamanohari raga and aditala led to the main raga of the evening, Shankarabharanam, which was elaborated in mellow, melodious fashion, with a plethora of quintessential sancharas around the thara sthayi shadja, gandhara and madhyama. The magnificent Deekshithar krithi &#8220;Akshayalinga Vibho&#8221;, set to misra chapu thala, featured an absorbing and masterful neraval at &#8220;Badarivana Mulanayikasahitha&#8221;, accentuated by superb violin and percussion accompaniment. The kalpana swaras were, however, comparatively brief, and the item was rounded off with an elaborate thani avarthana.
