VA vocal concert, a Bharatanatyam performance and a flute recital enthralled audiences at the &#8216;Bharathotsavam 2008,&#8217; Thirssur.The first day of the festival had a Carnatic vocal concert by Ajay Nambudiri, a  disciple of  Neyveli Santhanagopalan. Beginning with the Abhogi varnam, the singer presented a credible  performance of &#8216;Thulasidala,&#8217; a Tyagaraja kriti in raga Mayamalavagowla. His innovation at &#8216;Sarasiruha Punnaga&#8217; was an example of perfect synchronisation of rhythm and melody,  accompanied by violin interludes of  T.H. Subramaniam.&#8216;Mokshamuga Letha&#8217; in raga Saramathi was a paean to the  world of music.  He used well-known  note patterns for his manodharma. &#8216;Shobhillu Saptaswara&#8217; in raga Jaganmohini was followed by &#8216;Manavasada Varadey&#8217; in mellifluous Natakurinji. &#8216;Samana rahithey,&#8217; a GNB composition in the little known raga Sarangatharangini, came as a surprise to the audience.A Tamil composition by Papanasam Sivan  brought the main raga Karaharapriya to the fore. The initial alapana was rich and moved methodically through the higher to the lower notes but it ended rather abruptly. Bhajans in ragas Behag and Vrindavan Sarang concluded the concert.Ajay&#8217;s strength lies in his exposition of the middle and higher octaves, but the lower notes do not seem to be powerful enough. It would do him good in the long run to work on his diction. Alappuzha G. Chandrasekharan Nair and G. Manohar accompanied on the mridangam and the ghatam respectively.Nandini Rangan&#8217;s Bharatanatyam performance was very spiritual.  The invocation &#8216;Tat Tvam Asi,&#8217; which she herself choreographed,  was a prayer for global integration. The varnam in Ragamalika showed the sufferings of the heroine as she pines to be united with her lover, Lord Nataraja.Following this,  &#8216;Ramonama Bhabhoova&#8217; portrayed  a tale from the epics, in which Yasodha tells her son Krishna, the  story of Rama. When Yasodha reaches the account of Ravana carrying away Sita, the baby Krishna gets involved in his life in a previous avatar to such an extent that he cries out to Lakshmana, &#8216;Soumithree Dhanur, Dhanur,&#8217; urging him to take up the bow. This item provided ample scope for characterisation and Nandini did justice to the task at hand. She even brought in a touch of humour by depicting the various kings who attempted to string the bow, as a pre-requisite to woo Sita.A slow moving Javali, a creation of Swati Tirunal, found Nandini more at ease. The tillana in raga Mand required intricate yet fast footwork and perfect poses.The three-day festival ended with V. Vamsidhar&#8217;s  brilliant flute recital. Heir to a rich musical heritage, Vamsidhar had his grandfather master flautist  V. Desikachar as his guru and is currently under the tutelage of his uncle D. Balakrishna.The 22-year-old Vamsi  displayed a maturity and level of knowledge way beyond his peers.   His repertoire comprised mostly Swati Tirunal kritis.He began his concert with the Kanada composition &#8216;Mamava sada Janani.&#8217; Mohanam, a very effective raga on the flute, was followed by the famous Swati kriti &#8216;Jaya Jaya Padmanabha&#8217; in raga Manirang. Dikshitar&#8217;s own favourite, &#8216;Meenakshi Memudan Dehi&#8217; in Poorvikalyani proved this youngster&#8217;s ability beyond doubt.    &#8216;Bhogindra Shayinam&#8217; in raga Kuntalavarali came as a welcome break between two major ragas, Poorvikalyani and Thodi.Vamsi&#8217;s  alapana of Thodi, the major raga, was breathtakingly beautiful.   He was at his creative best in the manodharma section.  C. Rajendran was excellent on the violin, especially during this raga.Keeping with the high standard of the performance, the two percussionists, K. Jayakrishnan (mridangam) and G. Manohar (ghatam), played a rhythmic and flamboyant taniavarthanam.Without compromising on precision, Vamsi took the raga through circuitous notes and rhythms. The concluding song, &#8216;Visweswara Darshanam&#8217; in raga Sindhubhairavi relaxed and eased the  atmosphere exuded by Thodi.Veteran musician Trichur V. Ramachandran was honoured during the festival.&#8216;Kalivilakkinte Idampathi,&#8217; Sabareesh&#8217;s documentary on Kathakali actor Kottakal Sivaraman, and &#8216;Narinarayanam- the tale of a Pulikkali artiste,&#8217; directed by Rajesh Menon, were screened.The festival was conducted by Bharatham, a cultural organisation in Thrissur.
