VAs competent performers, the Hyderabad Brothers Seshachari and Raghavachari are well-equipped. But in their concert under the auspices of Krishna Gana Sabha in the Gokulashtami series, the equipment  was deployed to a major extent on expositional gar\u000arulity with very little grace. Of the two, Seshachari&#8217;s role was to stamp, based on skilled vocal manipulation, thrustful bounce in preference to fondling the beauty of ragas in the alapanas.Two ragas were elaborated at wearisome length. Purvikalyani was set in the Hindustani mode to traverse ustad-like  the octaves with a few sprinklings of the Carnatic phrases.  The brothers shared the delineation, each one trying to outdo the other in packing contrived  sancharas.  Their assertiveness only laid bare their mind far away from the tranquillising role of Carnatic music.The kirtana was &#8216;Ninnu Vinaga Mari&#8217; where the spatial articulation of sangatis was beat-based. Musical ethos for compassion to the sahitya was sidelined. The fecundity of kanakku in the process of swaraprastaras following an overbearing niraval turned into a boxing ring, the brothers and Karaikkudi Mani with his percussive acumen, planting punches in succession.The other raga vinyasa was Thodi. It was heart-warming to hear Carnatic Thodi in contrast to the earlier Purvikalyani. Even here,  the brothers seemed to be ill at ease with gracious presentation emphasising the truth that the line between art and craft in music is invisibly thin. The song was &#8216;Karuna Joodavamma.&#8217;&#8216;Lavanyarama&#8217; (Purnashadjam), &#8216;Okabari&#8217; (Kalavathy) served as time fillers.What exactly was the contribution of violinist S. Varadarajan? He was a picture of composure during the vocalists&#8217; robustness, bowing just the nyasa swaras. But in his solo version, he revealed his class, the richness of the sancharas in the two ragas indicating the place of refinement in music.Well clothed in phrasings abounding in lyrical tints, his understanding of raga vinyasa was superior in concept and elegantly mellow in expression. The raga documentation of Purvikalyani and Thodi reflected  their enchanting charms.Karaikkudi Mani&#8217;s accompaniment throughout was not sheer energetic percussive patterns. It vibrated the chords of laya erudition. He introduced variations of emphasis to make his playing style pronounced.Purushottaman on the kanjira chimed with Karaikkudi Mani now and then though his presence was subdued.Madurai Seshagopalan&#8217;s technique speaks of his extraordinary discipline that responds well to his swelling manodharma. It courses through with ease, grace and versatility.  His stupendous style cast its compelling stamp  on the ragas and kirtanas he rendered. This challenging approach to music reflected the passionate inter-relationship between vidwat and assertive aesthetics.The recital began on a promising note by the vibrant treatment of the songs, &#8216;Deva Deva Kalayami&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla) and &#8216;Bhuvini Daasudane&#8217; (Sriranjani). The Sriranjani alapana, short and to the point, was a delightful mix of direction and accuracy. It was not booming but rakti-laden with the sancharas finely balanced and intensely appealing. The most arresting aspect was the measured sound control of his voice, not flamboyant but felicitous. Thepiece de resista\u000ancewas the Khambodi alapana. Seshagoaplan has an incredible mastery over unfamiliar angles in raga vinyasa. In the rich  Khambodi he presented, there were shafts of traditional pidis and his lightning tara sthayi excursions were unique.At this stage his inclination for exhibitionism receded to a respectful distance and the briga-filled sancharas revealed a stunning view of the way he surfed through to the ati-tara sthayi shadjam.All the time the sound management was decibel-friendly.  But to a refined rasika, the exposition at the mandhara level glowed with classical warmth and endearing composure.The kirtana was &#8216;O!Rangasayee&#8217;. One must, however, come to terms with the liberties he took in handling the structure of kirtanas &#8211; patanthara suddha giving place to filigree ornamentation.Earlier, he sang Subha Pantuvarali. If good music looks at vocal balance, his alapana stood the test. Behind the layers of sancharas there was the vital aspect of depth. The contours of the raga were intelligently disguised in the formation of the sancharas. The kriti was &#8216;Sri Satyanarayanam.&#8217;  The most welcome part in his concert was the restraint he showed in the swaraprastaras. They progressed with more of rhythm than mind-boggling kanakku.The violinist V.V.Ravi was understandably pragmatic. In his solo versions, with his simple and straightforward approach, he confined himself to mapping out the essential features of the ragas Sriranjani, Subha Pantuvarali and Khambodi.Srimushnam Raja Rao, on the mridangam, draped his accompanying pattern with a thick veil of respectability. He evoked specific percussive delineation with the blend of thick and thin beats. Vaikkom Gopalakrishnan (ghatam) released his pharans on the pot, meticulously chiselled.
