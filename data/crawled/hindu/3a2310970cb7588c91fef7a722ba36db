VThe Bharat Sangeet Utsav recently organised by Carnatica and Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha featured Ashwini Bhide Deshpande&#8217;s Hindustani recital. A vocalist par excellence and a scholar with a published compilation of compositions to her credit, this artiste brings sustained vibrancy to the intricacies of the Jaipur Atrauli gharana.The prime choices for the evening were the raags Shree and Bhoop Nat. A sense of controlled power underscored the commencing passages of Shree in the vilambit &#8216;Hari Ke Charan Kamal&#8217; infused with a haunting air as phrases wove ever-changing permutations circling three notes &#8212; the tivra nishadh, shadja and the plaintive komal rishabh, emphasised by swara sahitya at &#8216;ni sa&#8217; sung as &#8216;Ni Sa Din.&#8217;The prolonged sojourn in the mandrasaptak evoked a meditative ambience carried forward by melodic movements in the madhyasaptak that echoed the ebb and swell of waves.The artiste made her customary powerful statement with a ringing shadja, achieving a grand upward thrust with open-throated passages.A needle-sharp tone and vadi-samvadi combinations put to good use lent high definition to the taans in the drut.The development of Bhoop Nat held many points of interest as two compositions in teen tal highlighted the breezy, effervescent air of the ascent with a more sober trail in the descent. A dadra set to keharwa taal and an abhang of Tukaram sung with much gusto proved the icing on the cake.Vyasaraya Katti&#8217;s (harmonium) deft playing matched the vocalist&#8217;s facile forays. Ravindra Yavagal (tabla) alternated between subtlety and sprightliness in his percussive support.Simple yet effective narrative devices and emotive singing breathed life into Visakha Hari&#8217;s portrayal of the life and compositions of Purandaradasa through harikatha. Regarded as the &#8216;sangeetha pitamaha&#8217; and forerunner of the music Trinity &#8212; Tyagaraja, Dikshitar and Shama Shastri &#8212; this saint-musician is credited with imbuing Carnatic music with much of its unique identity. In his prolific output of compositions, the recurring theme is hari smarana and surrender to the divine.Born into a wealthy family, Srinivasa Naik&#8217;s metamorphosis into Purandaradasa and his journey from the material to the spiritual plane were related by the artiste in a spirited, thought provoking manner. As Srinivasa grew wealthier, he became miserly to the point where even the thought of giving was acutely painful.One day, when he harshly turned away a brahmin seeking alms, the latter approached Srinivasa&#8217;s wife, a pious soul, who gave away her diamond nose ring. A miracle ensued and Purandaradasa awoke to the realisation of his true self and destiny, finding his guru in Vyasatirtha and seeking Lord Vittala in Pandarpur.The artiste&#8217;s prelude to compositions, often in the form of ugabhoga (verse) shone with bhava, encapsulating essence in ragas such as Yamunakalyani, Darbari Kanada and Madhuvanthi. An evocative Saveri followed by &#8216;Paraaku Maadadhe&#8217;with a detailed neraval found its mark, as did sketches of Varali and a particularly moving Revathi.The popular &#8216;Tamburi Meetidava&#8217; (Sindhubhairavi) demonstrated a keen feel for lyric. The adjective-laden description of Vittala seen through Purandaradasa&#8217;s eyes painted a near-visual picture.B. Ananthakrishnan&#8217;s essays of Saveri and Darbari drew much appreciation while B. Ganapathiraman&#8217;s (mridangam) sense of anticipation and pat sallies enlivened the presentation.
