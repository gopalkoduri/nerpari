VAmrutha Venkatesh lived up to her reputation as a top class vocalist at a concert at The Palghat Fine Arts Society recently. She captured the attention of the audience with her perfect sruti alignment. She was ably supported by an excellent team of percussionists.The recital commenced on a sprightly note with Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar's Kaanada raga varnam &#8216;Neranammithinayya' in Ada tala. The brief contours of Kedaaram, followed by &#8216;Tyagaraja Gurum Asraye,' a composition of M.D. Ramanathan in praise of Saint Tyagaraja, set the ideal concert ambience. The elaboration of Varaali, adorned with gliding karvais, was truly classical. The portrayal of Papanaasam Sivan's &#8216;Kaa vaa va,' appended with elongated swaraprastharas, amply illustrated the raga lakshanas.Excellent alapanaThe Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Sogasujudatharama' in Kannada Gowla was an apt prelude to the weighty Kambodhi, the main raga of the evening. Amrutha did full justice to the alapana, well exploring the multi dimensional traits of the raga. The elegant sanchaaras around &#8220;gaandhara&#8221; in the upper octave were a sheer delight. Violinist Avaneeswaram Vinu too painted a wonderful portrait of the raga, in his solo version.The kriti chosen was Dikshitar's magnum opus &#8216;Sri Subrahmanyaya Namasthe,' which was rendered with devout bhava.The lucid niraval at &#8216;Vaasavaadhi' conformed to the traditional path. The cluster of kalpana swaras with &#8216;dha' as the focal point made a great impact.The tani at this stage saw Balakrishna Kamath (mridangam) and Perukavu Sudheer (ghatam) providing a marvellous display of adroit strokes in Rupaka tala to the delight of the listeners.&#8216;Thunai Purindharul,' a Paapanaasam Sivan kriti in raga Varamu (Sudha Hindolam), came as a cool refresher in the post tani session. Amrutha took up Hamirkalyani for ragam, thaanam and pallavi. Her improvisations in the raga delineation, punctuated with subtle gamakas and akaaras followed by a delectable taanam, were breathtaking.The pallaviThe pallavi &#8216;Madhava Kesava Madhusudana Muralidhara Sada Maamava' in Adi tala- &#8216;khanda nadai' was an ingenious creation. Ragamalika swaras in Madhuvanthi, Vaghulabharanam and Rasikapriya showcased the depth of her manodharma.&#8216;Karuniso Ranga,' a Purandaradasa Devarnama, sung in a combination of two ragas Ramkali and Jogia and Swati Tirunal's &#8216;Kaanthanodu chennumelle' in Neelambari were etched in aesthetic melody. Amrutha concluded with a lilting tillana of Balamuralikrishna in Behag. Following the vocalist like a shadow, Vinu displayed his virtuosity. His raga and swara essays on the violin were marked by tonal richness.
