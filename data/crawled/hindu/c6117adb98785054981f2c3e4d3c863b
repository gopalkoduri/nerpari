VK.C. ASOKAn instrumental ensemble led by veena artiste Maya Varma was held in Thiruvananthapuram recently on the occasion of the release of her CD titled `Mayamurali.' The CD comprises a set of popular devotional songs and bhajans played by her on the veena.This is her second CD, a sequel to `Krishnasruthi,' a collection of devotional songs, she had composed.The team of musicians included Prasanth Shennai on the flute, Vrinda Varma on the violin, Nanchil Arul on the mridangam, Adhichanalloor Anil Kumar on the ghatom, Charu Hariharan on the ganchira, Valiyavila Jnaneswaran on the tabla and Neyyatinkara Aravindakshan on the morsing.The musicians played several popular numbers remarkably well, thanks to the concerted homework they seem to have done.The opening bit in Hamsadwani was played on the flute, followed by the kriti `Vatapi... '.Manodharma swarasin madyama kalam was sung at the opening phrase, `Vatapi gana pathim bhaje hum... '.A Swati kriti `Mamavasada janani... ' in Kanada (Roopaka talam) followed next after a briefsancharaof the raga on the flute, veena and violin in that sequence. In a similar format, a Swati kriti in Revagupti, `Gopalaka pahimam anisham... ' was also rendered.After `Raghuvamsa sudha' ... in Kathanakudoohalam, came the concluding ragamalika bit composed by Maya Varma in a cluster of ragas such as Hindolam, Revagupti, Reethigoula, Mohanam, Kharaharapriya, Amritha varshini, and Madhyamavathi. The flautist and the violinist ably supported the  main artiste.A rare sightRarely do we see a female artiste playing the ganchira in Kerala. Charu Hariharan, a Plus Two student and daughter of noted singer B. Arundadhi, played the ganchira in perfect harmony with the other percussionists.Though Maya Varma and her group did not go for any elaborate rendition of raga, niraval orkalpana swaras, the items presented were well played.   The programme was organised by Ahalya School of Veena, run by Maya Varma in Thiruvananthapuram.Bottom Template Starts
