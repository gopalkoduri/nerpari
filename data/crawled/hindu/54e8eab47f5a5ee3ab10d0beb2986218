V&#8220;Is Mr. R.D. Burman coming as well?&#8221; was the innocent query by a ground staff at the airport to one of members of the entourage that had just landed in Mumbai that morning on November 13.The question may have evoked sad laughter among those who know that R.D. Burman (a.k.a Pancham) passed away nearly 17 years ago. Twenty seven musicians had flown down to the twin cities, tickets priced up to Rs.2000 were being lapped up, fans had flown from different cities...Orion had organised what was probably the first-ever R.D. Burman show featuring the original musicians of the maverick composer. This was conceived and designed by Pradipto Sen Gupta (a noted mandolin player for many leading composers including RD Burman) and Amit Bhattacharya. The first half of the show was purely instrumental as popular songs from RD's films. And his title tracks too from Shaan and Sholay.What was refreshing was that it was music with real musical instruments &#8212; saxophone, trombone, alto sax, flute and trumpet. Percussion instruments like the madal, thumba and drums and side percussions like the resso resso, cabashe, Marcus made the show spectacular .And the typical RD-like innovations like two sandpapers rubbed against each other to generate the sound of a running train (in the song Hum Dono Do Premee from Ajnabee).This was back to the era of live instruments and not programmed synthesised music as is the norm today. That era challenged the imagination of a composer like R.D. to create a fine blend between all these instruments. That era was inclusive of the motivation of a musician to be able to give his best in his own small way in a team of 100 musicians in a live recording. An example of the last statement was cited by composer Uttam Singh (and one of the finest violinists ever), &#8220;I played a solo violin piece in Chura Liya. It was a small piece but well remembered&#8221;.That era was relived again. Along with Uttam Singh, Kersi Lord, the master of keyboards and jazz music and one of the most revered personalities in the world of music, was also honoured specially by the chief guest Akkineni Nageswara Rao.Sudesh Bhosle and Shailaja added the vocal track to add more thrill and nostalgia to the audience.The overall mood of the three and half hour show, the bonhomie among the team members at the back stage as they all packed up and boarded the bus on their way to a late dinner... all this may have prompted a different response to the airport ground staff's question &#8212; is Pancham really no more?
