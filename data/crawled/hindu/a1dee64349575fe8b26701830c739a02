VOrissa Association Mysore observed Utkal Divas or Orissa Day with two concerts, as a gesture of reciprocation of cultural specialties, and as an expression of harmony.Violin trio Mysore M. Manjunath, Karthik and Mahadevappa presented a short and charming concert accompanied by the equally inspiring P. Nataraj (mridanga) and Ramanuja (morsing).They selected popular and catchy ragas and compositions  presenting them in a style  intelligible   both to the learned and the laity.An optimum pace and proficiently extended nilugades in "Brovabharama" of Thyagaraja could musically convey the overall meaning, being further adorned with skilfully framed and vigorously exerted swarakalpana.A group dance performance in Odissi style by Nrithyashri and party, sponsored by the Government of Orissa, entertained the audience. Commencing the program with a Mangalacharan dedicated to Lord Nataraja, the group performed "Dashavathara" and "Ahe Nilo Shailo" &#151;  the highlights wherein synchronised stage activities and an abundance of attractive postures narrated the sequences.When Kalavathi Avadhooth sang at Shri Ramaseva Mandali as part of the Ramanavami celebrations, a redolence of melody spread into the hall. One of the  reasons was that all her efforts were aimed at presenting decent and chaste music without distorting it by indiscriminate demonstrations of technical sleights.With singular disposition on the part of the singer, all the other ingredients of music automatically fell into place. It was supported by scholarship and expertise employed judiciously  to reinforce spontaneous  accomplishment.Her voice, in spite of appearing to be what may be termed as thin and therefore not dramatically enticing, had in it a soothing softness and confidence which gradually revealed an admirable flexibility and gamut with the advancement of the concert.As the pattern of developing the alapanas differed with respect to different ragas, every raga stood out distinctly . In her it was not a manodharma that emerged out of mere constant technical practice but it was an evolvement of intuitive creativity, sound imagination and artistic visualisation built on genuine involvement.An exemplary exposition of "Marivere Dikkevaru" (Lathangi  -  Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer), and "Nannu Vidachi Kadalakura" (Natakuranji - Shri Thyagaraja) was in complete conformity with the supplicating tone embedded in the lyrics. An unbroken uniform flow of experience from beginning to the end of any particular presentation provided sufficient time for the development of a sustained meditative absorbing state.While Govindaswamy (violin) inspiringly complemented the artiste's extempore, the percussionists H.L. Shivashankara Swami (mridanga) and Shashishankar (ghata) went in tune with the singer's gentle propensities.V. NAGARAJBottom Template Starts
