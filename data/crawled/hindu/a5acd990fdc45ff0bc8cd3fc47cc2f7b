VGARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMDr. Lakshmi Sreeram's Hindustani recital was received like the first monsoon showers. The vocalist, also a performer of Carnatic music, offered a sumptuous fare of afternoon ragas, mostly from the Sarang family and other equally delectable evening melodic scales including a Mira Bhajan which Lakshmi herself has set to tune in a raagmala.A disciple of Pt. Vasantrao Kulkarni, Lakshmi's first `bandish' was a tribute to the creator, a composition of Mian Tansen in raag Brindavansarang. It took off after a short alap, mostly in the lower octave. The vocalist then gently introduced `Tum Rab Tum Saheb,' and gradually moved higher up the tonic and continued: `Tumhi Rahim, Tumhi Kartar.' The melody grew sharper, the harmonium joined in and the firm but tuneful beat of the tabla added to the overall vibration. Soon you were sure that this was the same piece that the legendary Pt. Bhimsen Joshi had immortalised in a recording somewhere in the 1960s.At the end of a second composition, a tarana written by Pt. Ramashraya Jha, in the same raag, the obvious question was why raag Brindavansarang, to which there is a Carnatic counterpart, is rarely among the melodic scales that artistes feature in a jugalbandi.The next two items  completed the post-noon ragas for the day, but the romantic phase in the recital had only begun. The fast-paced piece in raag Gaud Sarang &#151;  `Piyu Palana Laage Mori Akhiyaan,' &#151;  has little in common with Sarang except in name and raag madhmaad sarang  -   `Sajana, Baat Niharat Haari,' was sung in a semi-classical idiom. Together the two compositions gave a lively feel as the afternoon was wearing down.It was back to more serious and introspective tunes with the  composition in raag Shree. Lakshmi sang this evening raga first in medium tempo.`Saanjha Bhayi,' a composition of Pt. Vasantrao Kulkarni, was a racy piece. After a thumri, it was time for a Kabir bhajan set to tune by Pt. Kumar Gandharva. Finally, it was a Meera bhajan set to tune in raagmala by Lakshmi Sreeram herself.Shravan Poddar on the harmonium was rather subdued for the most part. Keshav Joshi came through more emphatically in showcasing his virtuosity.Bottom Template Starts
