VBhagyada Lakshmi Baaramma&#8230; How many times have I heard this song rendered before? At concerts, public events, and private functions&#8230; Most of us, in fact, have heard this famous lyric on Lakshmi countless times.But today, the song carried a special ring and had an unusual beauty. And it brought a lump to my throat. The song was being rendered &#8211;&#8211; and with such pleasing melody and rhythm &#8211;&#8211; by IDL Blind Band in which all 12 members are visually challenged.Established in 2006 by P.K. Paul, Founder and Executive Trustee, Indian Disabled League Foundation, the IDL Blind Band has members from economically-backward families, and all with some background in music. Paul took them under his wing, raised funds, organised training for them, and constituted them into a band which today performs for corporates, politicians, and private functions.Musical instruments from the best brands have been secured for them. Each is provided with a Braille notation book, and a walkman with audiocassettes into which the music has been transferred to enable individual learning. This is followed by group-practice sessions. We watched one such session and their cheerfulness, the camaraderie, their learning from each other, and the joy with which they performed was as touching as it was inspiring.Have any of the instruments been customised for their use, I ask, especially since a rhythm pad is difficult to handle for a visually challenged person. &#8220;No,&#8221; replies Paul, &#8220;we use the same instruments which other musicians employ. Only, we get the rhythm pad tuned by a professional before our artiste plays it,&#8221; he explains.The 12-member band is made up of Narsing (keyboard), Manohar (guitar) who happens to be Karnataka&#8217;s only blind guitarist, Prakash (dholak), Shanmugham (triple Congo), Eranna (tabla), and George (rhythm pad). The vocalists are Shalom who has an M.A. in Music, Nagina, Pasha, Sridhar, Singh and Shamanna.Paul is the father-figure and mentor whom everybody talks of with affection and gratitude. He not only manages this band and supports them financially, but also works with a quiet, tireless zeal for other visually and physically challenged people across Karnataka by organising welfare programmes for them. The IDL Foundation won a State Award in 2006 for their work.Braille music books and the use of touch alone to detect keys in instruments, make for a tough learning process but evidently the IDL Blind Band is more than equal to the challenge. They already have a repertoire of 300 songs across different music genres &#8211;&#8211;classical, semi-classical, folk, and film &#8211;&#8211; and are adding two new songs every week! And take a look at the kind of people they have performed for and won plaudits from &#8211;&#8211; the Indian cricket team, N.R. Narayana Murthy and his wife, film stars, leading industrialists, and many other celebrities.As the band members say, they are not looking for pity but empathy and an opportunity to perform and display their special ability.
