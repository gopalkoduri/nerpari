VR. Sriram, another symbol of the spirit of today&#8217;s youth, featured in a veena recital in the HCL concert series recently held at the Kasturi Srinvasan Hall, Music Academy. His niraval at &#8216;Niravadhi Suka Dhayakuni&#8217; for &#8216;Bhajana\u000aseya Radha&#8217; (Dharmavathi-Vasudevachar) was enough to indicate class and the enormous talent he has at his disposal.Sriram seemed to enjoy artistic freedom in handling the veena and his alapanas had a good mixture of phrases to portray the ragas without ambiguity.The selection of songs allowed room for different composers and scales. The young vainika, however, should bear in mind that if he is to become more aesthetically creative, he should learn to dwell at certain places  and this would also take care of the cut and dried approach that appeared to surface at certain points.Madurai Sundar on the mridangam and Arul on the ghatam accompanied with  deft fingers and their manner and method never  overshadowed the subtleties of the veena.
