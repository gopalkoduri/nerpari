VRadha Bhaskar&#8217;s vocal concert for the Sri Rama Navami Music Festival at Asthika Samajam,  was lively throughout. The selection of ragas and songs projected through Radha&#8217;s elegant rendition made listening a pleasure.Understandably, Tyagaraja kritis figured more but the artist consciously provided the main slot to Poorvikalyani and  Mysore Vasudevachar&#8217;s composition &#8216;Marachitivemo Maravakura Rama&#8217;. With voice in her full control, Radha delineated the ragas with  emphasis on the mellow aspects and the raga bhava.The brief outline of Ritigowla followed by &#8216;Paripalayamam&#8217; of Swati Tirunal offered after &#8216;Gajananayutam&#8217; in Chakravaham and &#8216;Marugelara&#8217; in Jayanthasri, gave a colourful start  to the concert. &#8216;Bantu reethi&#8217; in Hamsanadam and the elucidation with swaras at &#8216;Rama Nama Mane&#8217; could educe many a subtle nuances of the raga.Charukesi alapana  was expressive of Radha&#8217;s ability for the matured phrases of the soulful raga encompassing its enthralling range.The tara region sojourns were done with extreme care on shruti. Similarly, the meaty sections of the mandra sthayee parts too carried commendable levels of musical acumen.There cannot be a better choice than Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Aadamodi Galada&#8217; after that aesthetically built emotional edifice of Charukesi.The swara segment taken up on the pallavi in the end after the sensitive rendition of the kriti, melded well with the composer&#8217;s outpouring, with stress on the potency of the swaras.The Poorvikalyani expose carried several extensive phrases matching the range of the raga.The raga always carries majesty with melody. Gratifyingly, they were quite dominant in Radha&#8217;s interpretation.Vasudevachar&#8217;s &#8216;Marachithivemo&#8217; and the detailed niraval backed by swaras at &#8216;Pathitha Paavana Neeve Gatiyani&#8217; came with professional grace.The rare &#8216;Nee Madi Challaga&#8217; with a brisk chittaswaram in Anandhabhairavi of Matrubootayya was a notable inclusion.Melakkavery Thiagarajan&#8217;s violin support was just adequate though his efforts in raga alapana and swarakalpana were in good measure.Mudhra Bhaskar and H. Sivarmakrishnan provided adequate percussion support, though due to the poor audio system, the balancing of the rhythmic instruments was far from satisfactory and created an overpowering din of the percussion instruments.
