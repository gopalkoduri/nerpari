VChaitanya Art Theatres collaborated with TTD in organising this event at Tiru Nilayam, Balaji Bhavan, Hyderabad. And it was named &#8216;Annamayya Ganamrutham&#8217;.TTD EO, K.V.Ramanachari, informs that these Jayanthi Utsavas would he held henceforth at Tallapaka, native place of Annamayya, near Tirupati, on the lines of Thyagaraja Aradhana at Tiruvayyar.A 108 ft Annamayya statue would also be erected at this village by May, according to him. The festival here opened with Sobha Raju&#8217;s concert and ended with Balakrishna Prasad&#8217;s programme. They were early products of TTD&#8217;s &#8216;Annamacharya project&#8217; and are known for balancing musical content with Sahitya of Annamayya kirtanas.Balakrishna Prasad also takes credit for setting music to maximum number of compositions and singing many of them into his CDs. Many of the present day singers include his musical compositions too in their repertoire.There were two concerts each day - one by the city artiste and another hailing from another part of the state.Among others who stole the show was Swetha Prasad of Hyderabad who rendered melodiouslyMeluko Srungara Rayain Malaya Marutham set to music by Balakrishna Prasad,Purushothamudaveevuin Bhoopalam composed by Nedunuri,Manujudai PuttiinAbhogi,Akati VelalainMisr Jog,Itara DevathalainBahudhariscored by great master Dr. Pinakapani. There were also other numbers set to music by Balakrishna Prasad likeIde SirasuinPanthuvaraliandTane Tanein Suddha Dhanyasi.She brought Carnatic flavour by impressively essaying the ragaPoorvikalyaniand didswarastharain the kriti part.
