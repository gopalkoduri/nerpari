VThe inaugural concert at the annual music festival of  Sruthi Arts Academy, Madurai,  was rendered by Madurai T.N. Seshagopalan, who began with the Nattakurinji varnam, &#8216;Chalame.&#8217; The first half of the concert was characterised by excellent alapanas with haunting akaras matched by the fine underplay of the violin by Serthalai Sivakumar. In particular, &#8216;Aparama Bhakthi&#8217; in Pantuvarali impressed the audience.A very elaborate exploration of Kharaharapriya, as a prelude to &#8216;Pakkala Nilapadi,&#8217; was sung in the second half of the concert.The Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Kamalamba&#8217; (Ananda bhairavi) and Sankara Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Sundari En Soppanathil&#8217; (Khamas) were some of the other songs sung. Thrissur Narendran provided support on the mridangam.If the tedium of the week had exhausted the citizens of Madurai, their sense of equilibrium was restored by Sowmya&#8217;s wonderful performance.  Her niraval for the phrase, &#8216;Parvathi Neya Baktha Sahaya&#8217; in Latangi, for the song &#8216;Piravavaram Tharum,&#8217; was melodious. To the percussionist Manoj Siva&#8217;s delight, the song &#8216;Nenarunchina&#8217; was sung at a very fast pace.The Bhairavi alapana was remarkable for the variety and depth in the brigas. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Geetharthamu&#8217; (Surutti) and Dandapani Desikar&#8217;s &#8216;Ennai Nee Maravadhe&#8217; (Amirthavarshini) were familiar and pleasant to hear. The singer&#8217;s commitment to classical system and her unflagging energy made the performance a memorable one for all.The sophistication with which Ravikiran played the well known Kalyani varnam, &#8216;Vanajakshi,&#8217; was sufficient to showcase the versatility of his Vichithra Veena. He mentioned the special features of the rare ragas such as Vegavahini and explained how Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Sadinchane&#8217; focused on Krishnavatara and sang the lyrics of some pallavis, winning over the audience  with his scintillating performance.The audience also appreciated the confidence of Akkarai Subbulakshmi, the violinist.   She was particularly challenging in the ragam thanam pallavi.A special mention should be made of the percussionists, Parupalli Phalgun  (mridangam) and S. Sivaramakrishnan (ghatam), who played extremely well to make the concert a thumping success.Nityashree&#8217;s was an all-out effort to bring out the intricacies of Mohanam, which was the raga that she elaborated  in a leisurely pace, for the Tyagaraja kriti, &#8216;Nannu Paalimpa.&#8217; Earlier, her niravals for the phrase beginning &#8216;Govardhana Giri&#8217; in Madhyama Varali were commendable.The popular hits at the end included &#8216;Ayye Metha Kadinam&#8217; in Ahir Bhairavi and &#8216;Kanda Nee Oru Malaivasi&#8217; (Ragamalika). A melodious and classical performance was presented by T. M. Krishna to the accompaniment of V.M. Kumar on the violin. &#8216;Sri Rama Padama&#8217; in Amritavauhini was very well received.  Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar provided excellent support on the mridangam.The song &#8216;Thanthai Thayai Nee Marandhalum&#8217; in Ragamalika was enjoyable for its aesthetics. The concerts were an exposition of the Carnatic heritage at its creative best.
