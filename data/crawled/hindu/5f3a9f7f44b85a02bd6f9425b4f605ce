VRajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore, featured an enjoyable vocal concert of Swarna Rethas, to the accompaniment of Trivandrum Sampath on the violin and Kallekulangara Unnikrishnan on the mridangam at GKD Auditorium. Swarna Rethas has evolved a style of his own, though there are occasional sparks of resemblance to his guru Sanjay Subramaniam.The confidence with which he began the &#8216;Viriboni' varnam in Bhairavi was maintained throughout the concert. His raga delineations and niravals, enriched by smooth gamakas and the effortless cascading of swaras in the swarakalpana sessions spoke volumes of his rigorous &#8216;sadhaka'. He had chosen popular kritis such as &#8216;Janani Ninnu Vina' by Subbaraya Sastry in Ritigowla as well as the rarely heard kriti &#8216;Kaayaarohanesham' in Devagandharam by Dikshitar. Begada appeared in all her majesty preceding the centre piece &#8216;Nadopasana' by Tyagaraja.Lengthy RTPSwarna Rethas deserves special appreciation for the clean rendering of the Tamil compositions, &#8216;Darisiththalavil Mukthi Peralam' by Muthu Thandavar and &#8216;Paada Vendume' by Dhandapani Desikar. The latter is a lovely composition that defines how a song should be rendered. Swarna Rethas seemed to have internalised the instructions in the song. He certainly did full justice to his RTP in Chalanattai with the pallavi, &#8216;Vadivela, En Mel Jaalame Seyvathu Azhagaaguma' but people kept looking at the watch wondering how he was going to complete it and include the thukkadas within the stipulated time. He had no time for the lighter songs that are like a dessert in a concert. He concluded with Bharatiar's &#8216;Kaani Nilam Vendum Paraasakthi' listing out the rightful desires of a man who loved life to the core.Sampath's violin followed him faithfully, adding more sheen to the vocalist's rendering. His depiction of the ragas was very mature and succinct. Unnikrishnan on the mridangam enhanced the concert with his sensitive support and his laya patterns during the thani were fascinating.
