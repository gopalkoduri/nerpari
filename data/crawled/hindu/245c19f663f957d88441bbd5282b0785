VPuttannayya&#8217;s harmonium recital revived the joy of connoisseurs who cherish the instrument, which enjoyed a place of pride in the past. Senior scholar B.S. Vijayaraghavan reminisced the days when Pitilu Chowdaiah and B.S. Raja Iyengar presented their kutcheris with the harmonium played by Arunachalappa.Veteran musician Puttannayya is also an adept in traditional dramaturgy, having worked as a singer, actor, and background music player in the Gubbi Company.Naturally radiated nostalgic touches (sogadu) blended with excellent classical flavours, and all the numbers had tuneful curves, characteristic of the ragas. Emotive expressions were ingrained in the lyrics. GNB&#8217;s &#8220;Sadapalaya&#8221; (Mohana) stood as a fine example, the composition following an elaborate alapana; not a single movement appearing cursory. There were moments when he instantly composed the passages with definite spheres of expression, a feat pointing at a strong sense of intuition necessary in theatrical improvisations.A lyrical section, presented with proper accentuations in a majestic pace, was a tribute to GNB&#8217;s musical maturity quite obvious in the original notations. H.S. Thandavamurthi (violin) was always in readiness to enhance the impact.Swaraprasthara in the same fashion paved way for a thani avarthana by committed percussionists: M.S. Jayaram (mridanga), M.J. Kiran Kumar (ghata) and Ramanujam (morsing). Navaragamalika varna (&#8220;Valachi&#8221; - Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer), &#8220;Baaro Krishnayya&#8221; (Purandaradasa-Raagamaalika) and a rangagithe (Kamboji-B.N. Narayanadas) were other highlights.*** Another interesting concert was a duet by two stalwarts, Sukanya Prabhakar and R.N. Shrilatha.The senior artistes dedicated their concert to Vasudevacharya by focusing exclusively on his compositions, treating them with well-groomed competence.The singers took sufficient care at every step to see that their progressions did not overlap, and at the same time a spontaneous musical blend was appealingly established.As the concert was neatly planned, all the necessary elements fell into place.&#8220;Nive Rakshakudani&#8221; (Varna &#8211; Kadanakuthuhala) was soothing because of the majestic pace, and it transformed into an absorbing feat as the concert evolved.Swaraprasthara for &#8220;Pranamamyaham&#8221; (Goula) was developed well as the duo bore a collective responsibility, one taking cue from the other in building the musical strains.By the time they reached &#8220;Ninne Nammithinayya&#8221; (Simhendramadhyama), the stage was all set to for methodical alapana, clearly presented lyrics, meaningfully expanded rhyming charana (at &#8220;Nirajanetra Niradhanibha&#8221;) and refined passages of swarakalpana.&#8220;Paahikrishna Vasudeva&#8221; in Hindustani Kaapi was another gem &#8212; a composed elaboration, the approach in many areas appreciably encompassed shades of Hindustani music, particularly when they expanded the pallavi.The percussionists, B. Ravishankar (mridanga) and B. Shashishankar (ghata) exercising their discretion trod a gentle course, ideally to prove their vivacity in the thani avarthana.H.N Bhaskar&#8217;s violin too fortified the singers&#8217; predispositions.
