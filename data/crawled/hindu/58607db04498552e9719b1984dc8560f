VAt the sub-junior level, there were a few good finds such as Lakshmi Varma and Devi Varma (disciples of T.H. Subrahmaniam) who presented a violin duet.Repose or &#8216;vishraanthi&#8217; is said to be the quintessence of Carnatic music and Chepppad Vamanan Nambuthiri, who presented the first major concert, has that quality in abundance. A traditionalist to the core, he began with &#8216;Saami Ninne,&#8217; a varnam composed by Karur Devudu Iyer in Sree raga.The depiction of Chandra Jyothi was replete with its characteristic contours and the rendition of &#8216;Baagaayanayya,&#8217; in which Tyagaraja unveils the mystic existence of the Lord, was appreciated by the listeners. Arabhi was followed by  a Swati Tirunal composition &#8216;Narasimha Maamava.&#8217;  &#8216;Sobhillu,&#8217; composed in Jagan Mohini by Tyagaraja, helped in sustaining the equilibrium of the concert.S. Sowmya  always sings in a style that is reminiscent of her guru, S. Ramanathan. Her rendition of  ragas has a bewitching aura about it and her diction has a velvety softness. After beginning with Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Seethamma Maayamma&#8217; in Vasantha, she delineated Arabhi through the Swati Tirunal kriti &#8216;Paahi Parvatha Nandini.&#8217;&#8216;Bantu riti,&#8217; a Tyagaraja composition in Hamsa Naadham,  was embroidered with  kalpana swaras and in its wake came an eloquent description of Sahana, with &#8216;E vasudhaa&#8217; by Tyagaraja.&#8216;Sadaa Chaleswaram&#8217; in Bhoopalam and &#8216;Kshithijaa Ramanam&#8217; in Devagandgari, both by Dikshitar, added gravity to the concert.Delineating a raga like Kanakaangi is not easy for  a vocalist because it is structured by &#8216;Vivaadhi&#8217; swaras, which are unfriendly with one another. But it was not a difficult proposition for M. Jayachandran.  He sang  the raga with &#233;lan. His  composition &#8216;Amba Jagadamba,&#8217; which was adorned with the &#8216;ragamudra,&#8217; too was  catchy.Prior to that, he etched a classic Tyagaraja composition in Mayamalava Gowla, &#8216;Thulasee Dalamulache,&#8217; which was embellished with niravel and swaras.  &#8216;Jaya jaya Raghurama&#8217; was enlivened by a cluster of swaras attached to it.The Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Enduku Peddalavale&#8217; in Sankarabharam  was the nucleus of the concert. In between, Jayachandran sang &#8216;Orajupu&#8217; in Kannada Goula, &#8216;Sarasijanabha Sodari&#8217; in Nagagandghari, &#8216;Siva Siva Siva Yanaraada&#8217; in Panthuvarali, a bhajan in raga Patdeep and so on.Despite his singing in &#8216;Thaggu sruthi&#8217; (low pitch), Papanasam Ashok Remani impressed rasikas  with his  his selection of kritis  and grip on tempo. His rendition of &#8216;Bhuvini Daasudane,&#8217; a Tyagraja composition in Sree Ranjini,  emphasised the  message of unflinching loyalty to the Almighty.There was an element of shining classicism in his exposition of Poorvi Kalyani while &#8216;Jnaana mosaga raada&#8217; was laced with kalpana swaras.Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Maa Remanan&#8217; in Hindolam,  and Swati Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Jaya jaya Padmanabhamurare&#8217; in Sarasangi was followed by a comprehensive depiction of  of Thodi, in which there was a flash of Kalyani, which was brought about by manipulating the basic scale.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Kaddanuvaariki&#8217;  had a comely tapestry of niravel and swaras. &#8216;Saanthaakaaram Bhujagasayanam,&#8217; a ragamalika combining Hamsanandi, Begada, Surya and Bageswari, was an attractive piece.Ragam-thaanam in Dharmavathi, with the pallavi adorned by Kanada, Renjini and Kapi, was appreciated by the audience.Maharajapuram S. Ramachandran began his concert  with a varnam in Sahana, &#8216;Karunimpa Idi&#8217; by Tiruvottriyoor Thyagaiyer. Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Mahaganapathim&#8217; in Natta had enchanting sequences of chittaswaram and kalpanaswaram.Khamas was enlivened when it came forth in the form of  Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Santhana gopala Krishna.&#8217;  Mellifluous Kalyani followed with  Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Nidhi Chaala&#8217; in Chaapu. &#8216;Ranganathude,&#8217; a kriti by Tanjore Ponniah Pillai in Sowrashtram, and &#8216;Bandu riti&#8217; in Hamsanadam were followed by an erudite ragam thanam pallavi in Khaharapriya and a thillana in Sivaranjini.When vocal concerts are presented by a duo and one of the singers act as  a good foil to the other, the audience  relish it. This was evident in the manner in which a recital of Karukurichi N. Shashikiran and his cousin Chitravina Ganesh (Carnatica Brothers) was appreciated by the listeners.They began with the delectable Padavarnam &#8216;Chalamela&#8217; in Naattakurinji, composed by Moolaiveedu Rangaswamy Nattuvanar.  &#8216;Kshanameva Ganya,&#8217; composed by Oothukadu Makakavi in Bhouoli, came next.The elaboration of &#8216;Lalitha&#8217; by Shashikiran was a tribute to the legend in Nagaswaram, Karukurichi Arunachalam. The duo vied with each other in the realm of niraval and swaras that came in the wake of Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Hiranmayim.&#8217; &#8216;Malayamaarutham&#8217; was sung well by  Shashikiran and &#8216;thaanam&#8217; with Neelambari, Ahiri and Surutti, culminating in a pallavi, was shared by the duo.N. Remani can make any raga or kriti memorable because of his unhindered and spontaneous &#8216;Gaayaki&#8217; style bequeathed to him by the immortal Mahalingam. The Ada tala varnam in Kambhoji was followed by &#8216;Vathapi&#8217; and Renjini, with its raga edifice built up craftily with the help of &#8216;Durmaargacharaa,&#8217; composed by Tyagaraja and set to Roopaka tala.&#8216;Evaruraa,&#8217; a Tyagaraja kriti set to Chaapu, evoked the mellowness of Mohanam. Chaarukeshi had a fluent melodic lay-out and Swati Thirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Kripayaa Paalaya&#8217;  kept the listeners nodding in approval.  &#8216;Sree Krishnam&#8217; in Thodi was the centre piece of the concert.Chennai R. Prasanna&#8217;s guitar recital was a sumptuous feast. The flourishes and glides that he played on the  instrument when playing &#8216;Paraakela,&#8217; composed by Syama Sasthri in Kedaragoula, was unbelievable.&#8216;Jayajaya Padmanabhaanujesha,&#8217; a Swati kriti in Manirangu,  and &#8216;Deva deva,&#8217; again by Swati,  were widely applauded. Hindolam appeared with a tinge of Mohanam in it, by virtue of shruti bhedam. &#8216;Saamaja vara gamana&#8217; had a torrent of swaras. Bilahari was followed by &#8216;Tholijanma,&#8217; a Tyagaraja composition in Jhampa.
