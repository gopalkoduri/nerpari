VJAYARAMAN VConnoisseurs of mridangam  look forward to listening to the Palakkad Mani Iyer style and the one initiated by the left-handed Palani Subramania Pillai.Mani Iyer  imbibed the finer points of playing the mridangam  from Thanjavur Vaidyanatha Iyer to forge that inimitable `bhhaani' of his, incorporating  suitable elements from  indigenous percussion forms such as thayampaka and panchavadyam.Palani, a disciple of his father, Muthiah Pillai, and an ardent admirer of tabla,  reorganised the Pudukkotta baani by incorporating parans and tekhas, thus shaping  a distinctive style of his own that lives through Trichy Sankaran.Sankaran, who has settled in Toronto, Canada, recently accompanied O. S. Thyagarajan (OST) at Bhaktha Meera Temple, Vyttila, on the suburbs of Kochi.Thus the younger generation of percussion lovers got an opportunity to listen to Sankaran, who had visited Kochi only a few times to accompany Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and  T.K. Rangachary.OST,  with his powerful but chaste singing, enthused the mridangam artiste to euphonious realms of percussion with Kovai Balu (violin) and Neyveli Venkatesh (ghanjira) chipping in, though, on a subdued note.OST began with `Chalamela,' an enchanting padavarnam in Nattakurinji composed by Moolaiveedu Rangaswami Nattuvanar. Dikshithar's `Vallabhanayakasya'  in Begada  made way for a succinct `Gaanamoorthe.'The vocalist scaled  enviable aesthetic levels with `Biraana varaalichchi,' (Kalyani), one of the Syama Sastri compositions in Roopakam, which was  embellished  with nirval.Both the aspects of prescribed and applied music mingled gracefully in this composition.Poorvi Kalyani showed how gamakas should be astutely made use of in highlighting the dynamic subtleties of the raga concerned.Oothukadu Kavi, who reportedly lived as a recluse, systematically wove  kritis steeped in devotion, and OST successfully conveyed that  to the audience through `Padmavathi Ramanam.'Pitch alignment`Vinaradaa,' in Devagandhari, which Tyagaraja composed on the deity of Srirangam, and `Maarubalka' in Sriranjini, by the same poet-composer, and a classic description of Thodi with `Kadanuvaariki,' infused the concert with a momentum that was appreciated by the listeners.Trichy Sankaran's performance left a lasting impression on the listeners courtesy the perfect pitch alignment of the mridangam and the vocal,  the skill in following the niraval-swaram and the variety of `Theermaanam.'Bottom Template Starts
