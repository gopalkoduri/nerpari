VPattabhirama Pandit's concert at Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha, Thripunithura, reminded rasikas of his guru, Palghat K.V.Narayanasawmi, and the Ariyakudi bani. Pandit's rendering was in tune with KVN's style, and his focus was on swaraprasthara.Pandit began his concert with &#8216;Sarasijanabha,' a varnam in Kamboji by Swati Tirunal. The artiste revealed his skill as a singer as he sang this varnam in the traditional four-kaala style. His way of rendition again reminded listeners of the Ariyakudi bani. However KVN's influence on the singer was revealed in the niraval and alaap of Varali while the artiste sang Dikshitar's &#8216;Seshaachalanaayakam.'Special approachThe special approach to sahithya was evident in &#8216;Sree Jaalandhara' in Gambheeranatta, composed by Mysore Jayachamaraja Wodeyar. The niraval in the charanam, &#8216;Govindam uraga saayanam,' was apt.After bringing out the ragabhava of Revagupthi, Pandit rendered a brief but aesthetic rendition of the Swati kriti &#8216;Gopalaka Paahimaam Anisam.'The highlight of the concert was Mysore Vasudevachar's &#8216;Brocheva' in Khamas, in which Pandit did an excellent niraval at &#8216;Bhasura muga kari raajunu.' This was followed by a tani by Changanassery B. Harikumar (mridangam) and Elanjimel P. Suseelakumar (ghatam).The vocalist was able to bring out the meaning of the lyrics of &#8216;Daasaradhe Karunaa Payonidhe Ravikulathilaka,' the pallavi in Thodi. It was followed by a brisk thaanam and ragamalika in Nalinakaanthi, Revathi and Bilahari.
