VHarini and Sharada accompanied by C.N. Thyagarajan (violin), H.L. Shivashankaraswamy (mridanga) and S. Manjunath sang at Ganabharathi justifying the imports of the lyrics of the composition of Thyagaraja, &#8220;Svararaga Sudharasayuta Bhakthi&#8221; in Shankarabharana, which in fact they sang as the focus of the concert.In the widely prevalent music scenario where mathematics is playing a determinant role as a measure of an artiste's expertise or scholarship, and wherein the mind of a listener is deviated unawares from experiencing finer aspects and sentiments the sage vaggeyakaras invariably advocated, it is rare to hear concerts of pronounced dedication, pleasing melody, and absorbing sentiments with optimum intricacies. Present concert was one such rarity.The background: &#8220;Svararaga Sudharasayuta&#8221; embodies the significances of many spiritual paths and the ensuing experiences any aspirant is supposed be aware of while he is in pursuit of such goals. Only a naada ( anahatha) emanating from the muladharachakra or a naada evolving from sahaja bhakthi (emanating from within, as opposed to pretentious pomposity) can carry forward the aspirant towards his goal, and not the rhythm-intricacies (in the present context, mean it as akin to needless calculations) devoid of devotional maturity.True to the significance of the composition, the singers with their melodious voices unfurled its meaning convincingly at all levels: an elaborate alapana smoothly spanning over the required sthayis set a fitting ambience for the general theme to flourish; and clear pronunciations assisted by proper accentuations did a great deal in realising the finer aspects of the lyrics.Singers expanded the charana at &#8220;Muladharaja Naadamerugute&#8221; reaffirming the general meaning from different tuneful angles, and later suitably decorated the neraval with tastefully improvised swara passages.It was more or less a similar experience with another number &#8211; &#8220;Aparadhamulanniyu&#8221; of Patnam in Lathangi. The very manner in which they elaborated the raga, laying more emphasis on the articulations in tara sthayi instantly pointed at the composition that followed.Even the introductory overture was very precise in clearly delineating the morphology of Lathangi, and with further expatiation, the portrayal of its personality reached its completion.Nevertheless, in the light of the intensity and the gravity of the composer's supplicating tone, a slower pace in general (though challenging) would have given them more scope for better and impressive expressions; and consequently this would have made the neraval at &#8220;Kripachesina Manavyalaginchi&#8221; truly appealing and emotive, in addition to the musical appeal it carried.&#8220;Maakelara Vichaaramu&#8221; (Thyagaraja-Ravichandrike &#8211; appended with a few passages of swarakalpana), &#8220;Mokshamugalada&#8221; (Thyagaraja-Saaramati &#8211; prefaced with a melodious and absorbing alapana followed by an equally emotive rendition of the lyrics) and &#8220;Kanjadalayathakshi&#8221; (Dikshithar &#8211; Kamalamanohari &#8211; hurriedly sung: observe the madhyama kala passages for a clear idea) were other highlights of the concert.
