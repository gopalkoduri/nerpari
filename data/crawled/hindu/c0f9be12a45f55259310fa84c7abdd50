VIt was an incessant shower of dew drops on a hot summer evening. The inimitable Hyderabad Brothers' rendition was soothing, serene and soulful. It defined real music in a word: emotive. Not a soul stirred till they decided to call it a day.The Khambhoji, Adi tala varnam, Taruni&#8230; opened up the vistas for all that was to follow. The raga effervescence was still lingering in the air, when Bala kanakamaya&#8230; in Atana transported us to the second level of joy. Their creative virtuosity first steady, then a pick up and finally launching into a whirling climax as always mirrored their hold on the medium. Short but sweet flow of swaras was something to watch for in D. Seshachari and D. Raghavachari. While the former sets in the lively tones, the latter (elder of the two) adorns it with his brand of rich feeling. Their mastery lies in their reach and touch which aims straight at your heart.Smarane sukhamu&#8230; (Janaranjani) is popularly appealing true to its raga nomenclature. This simple song carries the &#8216;full content' of bhakti as envisaged by Thyagaraja and the duo conveyed just this as they rendered it with sweet grace. A compelling alapana by Seshachari, taken over by his elder brother in gentle tones, gave way to Nee saati daivamu&#8230;in Sriranjani. The cascading swara kalpana was wonderful and served to reiterate their prowess in artistry. The ease with which they handle the technicalities without sacrificing the raga bhava or the lyrical melody and diction, is the hallmark of Hyderabad Brothers' style of rendition. D.S.R. Murthy on the mridangam at this point of time gave one of his best beat. Koluvaiunnnade Kodandapani&#8230;. (Dikshitar's Telugu composition) in Devagandhari was rippling and rhythmic, reminiscent of dance footwork.The Kalyani began caressingly through Seshachari's alapana, delineating the raga nuances, elaborating and escalating into its fullest glory. Suryadeepti's excellent follow on the violin was as expressive as the alapana by the vocalist. Ye taavuna raa&#8230; with stylistic emphasis on the line, &#8216;Sati, Gowri&#8230;' especially by Raghavachari as he goes through the neraval was like a special effect. The manodharma that followed scaled all the cycles in absolute abandon, enriched this raga. The subtle scaling down technique is their forte. The thani by Murthy, was optimum but compelling.A brief Kshetrayya padam ( Aligithe) in Husseini, later, an all-time favourite in Tamil Naanoru vilayattu bommaya&#8230; in Navarasa Kannada a Papanasanam Sivan composition, rich in lyric was superbly executed by the duo. The tillana in Pahadi was melodic to the core, reminiscent of the ebb and flow of a calm sea. The concert was hosted by Trividya Peetam, a charitable foundation for the cause of music in collaboration with Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan at the latter's auditorium.
