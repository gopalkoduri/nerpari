VClassical TreasuresUstad Bade Ghulam Ali\u000aKhan (Vocal )Virgin Records ( India ) P LtdMRP Rs. 295For those Hindustani music aficionados who have not had the opportunity to listen to the scintillating music of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, this CD will provide a glimpse into the masterly exposition of three ragas handled by the vocalist.Ghulam Ali Khan's voice is remarkable for those notes which are organised into roulades, turns or mordents. His scholarship is evident from the moment he commences the alaap, dwelling on the first note he chooses. He has been held in high esteem by many greats in the Carnatic music firmament such as G.N. Balasubramanian, M.S. Subbulakshmi and M.L. Vasanthakumari.The ustad has essayed ragas Piloo, Sindubhairavi and Ragesri in this disc. He hits the bull's eye on every occasion he approaches the tara stayi panchamam. The leisurely method in his approach to Ragesri followed by a brief swaraprasthara is breathtaking and one wonders how a minor raga such as Ragesri can assume such gigantic proportions.The vocalist's sruti alignment is just perfect and sways the listener into a tranquil mood. A feeling of joy is experienced while listening to the vinyasas and makes repeated listening unavoidable. One cannot but marvel at the incredible mastery of the Ustad.
