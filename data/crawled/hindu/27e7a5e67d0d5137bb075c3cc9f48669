VThe life of Helen Keller in dance was presented on the first day of the 59th anniversary celebrations of the Satguru Sangeetha Samajam. The title was &#8216;Vision beyond Sight.'Then followed a series of concerts beginning with Sashikiran and Ganesh, popularly known as Carnatica Brothers. They began with &#8216; Sarasijanabha' in Khambodi. Sashikiran took up the challenging alapana in Lalitha for the Dikshitar kriti, &#8216;Hiranmayeem,' while Ganesh brought out the raga lakshana of Huseini by dwelling on some choice phrases for Sivananda Yogi's, &#8216;Enna Punniyam Seydharo.'They alternated a fast &#8216;Ennai Nee Maravadhe' of Dhandapani Desikar in Amrithavarshini with a gentle &#8216;Varuvaro' in Sama by Gopalakrishna Bharati.The singers did not particularly attempt to complement each other or sing in a synchronised way -- they sang in their individual styles and added lustre to the concert.They presented ragam Bhagesree for their own pallavi, &#8216; Madhurapuri Nilaye.' They offered to sing the pallavi in ragas selected by the audience and came up with enjoyable presentations of Kalyanavasantham, Ranjani and Revathy.The participation of the percussionists, D. Harikumar on the mridangam and Kovai V. Mohanram on the ghatam, was strong when the singers launched into chittai swarams, and both played with equal volume and verve during the solo. The violinist (N.C. Madhav) had less scope as the brothers kept taking over from each other, but he made good use of the solo opportunity.Utmost satisfactionSanjay Subrahmaniam's Ata tala Kanada varnam, &#8216;Nera Nammithi,' was followed by his interesting swara embellished presentation in Kalavati, for the lyrics of &#8216; Siddhi Vinayakane,' by Kavi Kunjara Bharati. Mysore Sadasiva Rao's, &#8216;Saketha Nagara Nadha,' in Harikhambodi followed. The Tamil composition by Arunachala Kavirayar, &#8216; Arivaar Yaar Unnai,' was preceded by a well received and short alapana in Mukhari. In his main alapana, Sanjay made a very distinct elaboration of raga Yamunakalyani for the song, &#8216;Nandagopala.'The RTP in the rare raga Narayanee was done with effortless ease for the pallavi, &#8216;Narayananai.' Nagai N. Muralidharan on the violin took up the challenging phrases presented by the singer and played with flair and creativity. B. Harikumar on the mridangam and Alathur Rajaganesh on the ghatam added to the perfection of the presentation. Papanasam Sivan's &#8216; Kadaikkan Paarvai' in Khamas was rendered quickly and &#8216;Porumaiyudan' in Bageshree was a satisfying end to the concert.The highlightMaharajapuram S. Ramachandran began with the Sahana varnam, &#8216; Karunimpa,' and sang &#8216; Varasiddhi Vinayakam' by Ambi Dikshitar in Nattai. These popular ragas were presented in a traditional and controlled style and in a deep pleasant voice.The next song, Swati Tirunal's, &#8216;Paripalaya,' was in the equally popular Pantuvarali. The raga which received special treatment was Suddha Hindolam and the long alapana was well supported on the violin by M. R. Gopinath, for the song, &#8216; Thunai Purindhal.' Kapi was the raga to be served next, in a brisk rendition of Tyagaraja's, &#8216; Mee Valla Guna Doshamemi.'The highlight of the concert was the Kalyani alapana which was free flowing, and in all three stayis for the song, &#8216;Enduko Nee,' (Tyagaraja). The kalpanaswara which followed was equally spellbinding.Tiruvarur K. Bhakthavatsalam played very subtly and in a subdued fashion till his solo. He found a very talented partner in the ghatam player Tiruchi Murali. The rendering of &#8216; Lakshmi Kalyana' in Neelambari brought smiles on the faces of the audience.Nuanced to perfectionOn the fifth day of Sri Satguru Sangeetha Samajam's anniversary celebrations, T.M.Krishna chose to begin his concert with the kriti in Anandabhairavi composed by Syama Sastri, loading it with kalpanaswaras and niravals.A quick rendering of the Tyagaraja kriti, &#8216;Vidajaladura,' in Janaranjani was followed by a tasteful delineation of Shanmukhapriya by both the singer and his accompanist on the violin, B.U. Ganesh Prasad. Krishna was meticulous in executing attractive niravals for the pallavi beginning, &#8216;Marivere Dikkevverayya.' The outstanding part of the concert was the Ragam Tanam Pallavi in four ragas that appeared in the pallavi, &#8216; Shankarabharananai Azhaithodi Vadi Kalyani Darbarukku.' Krishna's alapana in all the four ragas were followed by tanam sung in the same vein.The accompanist too played the ragas in the alapana and Krishna delighted the audience with the rendering of the pallavi shifting from one raga to another in every phrase. &#8216;Aarumo Aaval' by Kannan Iyengar in Mand and Subramanya Bharati's &#8216;Chinnanjiru Kiliye' sung in different sets of ragas were among the final pieces. Maavelikara Balaji and V. Krishna on the ghatam provided rhythmic support with adequate variety.Gradually built edificeShashank, as he is accustomed to, left the choice of the songs to the audience. Akkarai Subhalakshmi provided support with unwavering attention, in a base pitch as against the shrill and sweet notes of flautist. .Shashank began his alapanas with slow swaraprastaras that attempted to capture the key note of the ragas and gradually built it up to a crescendo thereby maintaining the interest of the listeners. Following the starters, Tyagaraja's &#8216; Nenarunchara,' in Simhavahini and Dikshitar's &#8216;Annapoorne' in Sama, Shashank played an engrossing alapana in Ranjani. With Subhalakshmi given the option of playing as many times as possible, it was a delightful duet which both the percussionists, P. Sathish Kumar on the mridangam and Thiruppunithara Radhakrishnan on the ghatam, joined with gusto, taking turns to provide rhythmic support to the main artist and the accompanist. Tyagaraja's &#8216;Intha Soukyamu' in Kapi could have referred to Shashank's playing too -- so serene was his presentation. In the RTP Shashank displayed his ability in playing at a high pitch without assaulting the senses. He played at such a high speed that his fingers moved faster than that of the percussionists.Madurai debutAbhishek Raghuram performed for the first time in Madurai. He began with the Sahana varnam, &#8216; Karunimpa,' followed by &#8216;Ganasudha Rasa' in Nattai. His presentation of kalpanaswaras was confident but sounded rehearsed in some places. His alapana in Hamsanadham was followed by a faster than normal rendition of Tyagaraja's &#8216;Bantureethi Kolu.' This was nowhere more evident than in the frenetic speed at which Salem Srinivasan tapped the mridangam. Anirudh Athreya managed better on the ganjira.Oothukkadu Venkata Subbaiyar's &#8216;Thaaye Yashodha' and Gopalakrishna Bharati's &#8216;Idhuthano Thillai Sthalam' in Behag were sung with due attention to melody and sounded harmonious with the fiddle play by Amritha Murali, who had to keep pace with the rush most of the time. The tanam was the best in the Nattaikurinji RTP beginning, &#8216;Kanna Mani Vanna Va,' which sounded jerky, probably due to the singer's concentration on the percussion.(To be concluded)
