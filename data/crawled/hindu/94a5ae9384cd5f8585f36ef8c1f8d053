VWaltair Rotary Club organised a marathon session where 108 compositions of Annamayya were sung at a stretch. Somayajula Indira Bharadwaj and Chaganti Sandhya Sundar, both graded artistes of Akashvani in light and devotional music and students of Sarada Annamayya Sangeetha Vidyalayam fervently accomplished the feat. Indira and Sandhya together harmoniously sang chosen lyrics set to music by Nedunuri Krishnamurty, Balakrishna Prasad, Pasupathi, Parupalli Ranganath and Balantrapu Rajanikantha Rao and their likes in ragas like Bhairavi, Kedaragoula, Mohana, Amirkalyani, Kalyani, Anandhabhairavi, Chakravakam, Mukhari, Devagandhari, Khamas etc.Making reasonably a good effort in surfacing the sahitya and ragabhavas, they rendered 108 compositions in little over 12 hours with three breaks of 10 to 15 minutes each.Kudos to K.V.S. Prasad (Akashvani graded artiste) who lent excellent support on violin and also led the orchestra with felicitous charm indicating the form of raga in which the next composition had to be sung on all the 108 instances.Ch.Srinivasa Rao of Narsipatnam also lent similar support on key-board. Tirupathi M. Sudhakar, Mandapaka Ravi and Dhanwada Dharma Rao on mridangam along with A. Anandakumar, S. Jeevitheswar Rao and Ch. Kumar on tabla, laudably accompanied together occasionally and mostly in turns.Chief guest of the evening Sadguru Sriman K. Sivananada Murty was all praise for the singers and their accompanists .
