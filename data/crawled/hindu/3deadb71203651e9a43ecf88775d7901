VThe depth and deftness that violinist Kanyakumari gained by accompanying M. L. Vasantakumari was in evidence during her solo recital for the Fifty-Fifty Club, but for two recent influences. The contact-mike white violin with which she plays now robbe\u000ad her music of the natural sweetness of the regular violin.There was more booming sound than melting notes. The other one is: she has slowly drifted from MLV&#8217;s guidance to the saxophone enclosure. Her versatility has taken to more loudness than lyricism. She would do well to use the regular violin in her solo programmes.One satisfying aspect in the performance was the selection of songs. The meticulous way in which she presented them had to be acknowledged. &#8216;Nada-Thanumanisam&#8217; (Chittaranjani) and &#8216;Rama-Nannu-Brovara&#8217; (Harikambhoji) laid the solid base for the items to follow. The Harikambhoji alapana brought out Kanyakumari&#8217;s closeness to artistry.The next Devagandhari piece &#8216;Ksheera-Sagara-Sayana&#8217; and &#8216;Hiranmayim&#8217; (Lalita) were rendered with great poise, but failed to stir and inspire. The Lalita raga essay was marked by methodic maturity.The sanchara thrusts of Hemavathy, the main raga, were penetrating, proclaiming her as an experienced violinist with a robust style. The raga lines were carefully guided by her kutcheri experience to reveal her abiding vidwat. The kirtana &#8216;Sri-Kantimatim&#8217; was marked by extreme thoroughness in handling the sangatis and in the improvised swara-session.The limitation of the booming sound of the white violin was obvious when it failed to capture the nuances of Sahana&#8217;s shades both in the alapana and in the moving song &#8216;Vandanamu-Raghunandana.&#8217; With all these trends in her playing, the concert was decent and decorous. When her assistant Rajeev in his brief interludes handled the regular instrument, the contrast in sound between guru and sishya was telling.A mridangam accompanist of high standing, K. V. Prasad with the depth of his percussive style, shared Kanyakumari&#8217;s presentation. The tani was not just energetic. Korvai patterns but vibrated the chords of laya vidwat refinement.
