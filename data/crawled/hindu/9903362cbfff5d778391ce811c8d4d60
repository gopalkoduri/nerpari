VEndowed with a pleasing stage presence and a melodious voice, Vijayalakshmy impressed the audience with a judicious mixture of the popular and rare kritis of  great composers. She established an immediate rapport with the audience by rendering the ata thala varnam &#8216;Viriboni&#8217; in an impeccable manner.&#8216;Sidhivinaayakam&#8217; by Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar in Mohana Kalyani was a good choice as the liveliness of the kriti, followed by the sparkling swaras, paved the way for a smooth sailing. She followed it up with Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Manavyaalakincharadate&#8217; in Nalinakanti. Her Abhoghi alapana was typical of the TRS (T.R.Subramaniam) school and perfectly suited the Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s kriti &#8216;Nekkurugi Unnaippaniyaa.&#8217;Having been trained under different gurus of great calibre, her alapanas not only had authenticity, but also exuded the flavour of the raga. Her majestic portrayal of Mayamalavagowla was just meant for &#8216;Meru Samaana Dheera&#8217; by Tyagaraja, whose devotion and affection for the Lord are beautifully brought out in this kriti and Vijayalakshmy rendered it with proper bhava. &#8216;Brovavamma Bangaaru Bomma&#8217; in Nilambari by Syama Sastri was exquisitely beautiful sans ornamentation. The underlying devotion of the kriti was inseparably blended with the rasa of the raga and Vijayalakshmy&#8217;s mellifluous and dignified voice acted as the medium to give it a shape.&#8216;Chidambara Natarajam Aashrayeham&#8217; in Kedaram by Dikshitar was fast, preceding the alapana of Thodi. She sang the rare kriti by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar, &#8216;Sri Venkatesam Varam, Chintayaami Bhavaharam.&#8217; Then followed the ragamalika virutham from Kandar Alangaram comprising the ragas Kapi, Shanmukhapriya, Mohanam and Sindhu Bhairavi.&#8216;Velum Mayilume&#8217; in Sucharithra by Koteeswara Iyer was a pleasure to listen to. She is justly famous for her bhajans and &#8216;Paavana Kaaya Raghavendra&#8217; in Ahir Bhairavi was a glowing tribute to Sri Raghavendra swamy.The thillana in Brindavani by Balamuralikrishna gave a lively finish to the concert that entertained the audience without a moment of dullness.Vittal Ramamurthy&#8217;s violin was a real treat. He followed the vocalist faithfully giving her voice a glistening brightness. His raga delineation and swarakalpanas gave a glimpse of his vidwat and creativity. Ganapathiraman&#8217;s mridangam was full of verve and certainly added to the success of the concert.
