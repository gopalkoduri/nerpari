VHindustani vocalist Jasmeet Kaur has released a  CD that explores the essence of  ragas such as Nat Bhairav. The recording begins with a piece in vilambit ektaal. Here, Jasmeet, on her surbahaar, touches the sombre notes of the raga, with shud swaras and komal dhaivat in place.After delineating the raga in the lower octave, Jasmeet moves slowly but surely with a deep resonant voice in a gayaki, laden with meends and murkis. The piece in drut  ends with rigorous outburst of taans.Her rendition of Ragashree is cheerful, and she creates an impeccable aura that seems to communicate timelessness.  Jasmeet, a disciple of Pt. Rajan and Pt. Sajan Misra, has imbibed their subtlety of style and expression. The influence of the two Ustads on Jasmeet&#8217;s singing is unmistakable. Yet,  she is able to achieve a creative style that is her own.Accompanying her are Shantanu Shukla on the tabla and Bajirao Vartakhade on the harmonium.Jasmeet Kaur; Hindustani classicalSwarangan; Rs. 150
