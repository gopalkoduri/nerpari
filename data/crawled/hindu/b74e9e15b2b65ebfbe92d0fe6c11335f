VSVKThe characteristic feature of the music of Lakshmi Rangarajan is the way she nourishes kirtanas and ragas with her melodious voice.It is the polished content in her programme that gives an aesthetic uplift. Each karvai, each sanchara and each sangati  was aimed at making the concert for Sri Krishna Gana Sabha's Skanda Sashti series highly pleasurable.The recital contained songs on Muruga. Saveri (`Muruga Muruga') Bilahari (`Sri Balasubramanya') and Khambodi (`Sri Subramanyaya Namaste') alapanas stood out for controlled deliberation. The voice was classically smooth enabling her to generate sheaves of beautiful sancharas.Of the ragas she developed, Saveri had a touch of tonal felicity; Bilahari was lively, revealing its specific aromatic flavour and Khambodi presented with good voice modulation, was soft and flexible. The three raga essays were decent, decorous and becoming.  The kirtanas in the three ragas lent distinction to her training and sadhaka.The other songs  she rendered were: `Swaminatha' (Nattai), `Mohanakar' (Neetimati, a composition of Koteeswara Iyer) and `Sri Valli Devasenapathe' (Natabhairavi).A violin accompanist has to link his skill with crispness. K. Gokul was enthusiastic to over-extend his solo alapana versions. The mridangam player, Papanasam Kumar, was thrifty and sparing in his tani avartanam.Bottom Template Starts
