VA resolution to push the envelope, bolstered by the confidence that comes from diligent preparation and offset by a clutch of rarely heard compositions, lifted the Ragam Sisters&#8217; (Sivaranjani and Nalinakanthi) concert above run-of-the-mill presentations. Notably, a slew of clearly articulated Tamil compositions grabbed attention. Among them, &#8216;Tandava Darisanam&#8217; (Ritigowla) with gracefully-etched sangathis, soothed. Chockful of sahitya bunched in terse clusters, the kriti &#8216;Aarumuga&#8217; (Suddha Saveri) marched smartly ahead. But it was a lovely rendition of Koteeswara Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;Malayaade Maname&#8217; in Sarasangi that took pride of place with an intricate sangatis in which sensitively handled niraval and kalpanaswaras tapped into emotive caches.While the initial Sarasangi raga phrases drew you in with the promise of tenderness, the build-up sped on in fast forward mode with no let-up in an unrelenting rain of swift prayogas. The paucity of pauses and restful karvais that could have provided areas of contrast, left little opportunity for artist and rasika to savour the raga&#8217;s intrinsic bitter-sweet tinge. Fleeting suggestions of Sankarabharanam in certain gandhara-centric prayogas, though inadvertent, could have been avoided.The Trinity did not go unrepresented. &#8216;Mayamma&#8217; (Ahiri, Syama Sastri) was a competent rendition, though not the best of choices for synchronised duo singing, what with the kriti&#8217;s subtleties demanding an exploration of inner space and interpretational nuances that make for memorable personalised expression. Interestingly, the first round of kalpanaswaras surfaced not in the opening piece &#8216;Sri Maha Ganapathe&#8217; (Nattai) but in the haunting vivadi raga kriti &#8216;Panipathi Saayi&#8217; (Jankaradhwani, Tyagaraja) which carried an extended spell of sensitively crafted swaras. &#8216;Jambupathe&#8217; (Muthuswami Dikshitar, Yamuna Kalyani), was lilt and sway in equal parts, its inclusion leaving you refreshed and wondering why it isn&#8217;t heard more often.The choice of main raga, after an unusual line-up, came as a surprise - Harikhambodi. The exposition was a storehouse of vibrancy with karvais at the panchama and dhaivata balancing ever-shifting vistas lit up by spirited, sharp-edged prayogas, traversing octaves with insouciant ease. The style was reminiscent of a past era of gramophone records, with high pitched female voices embarking on adventurous flights with abandon. &#8216;Entharaani&#8217; set off at a brisk trot, well sustained in an energetic flurry of niraval and swaraprasthara.Srilakshmi Venkataramani kept pace with the sisters&#8217; rapid-fire delivery, taking care to pack in leisurely phrases in Harikhambodi. Hanumanthapuram J. Bhuvaraghavan&#8217;s (mridangam) playing held resonance and displayed absorbing motifs in the thani with Tiruvarur Sai Krishnan (ghatam).The Serugudi Sisters,Rema and Geethabegan with a bright &#8216;Varavallabha Ramana&#8217; (GNB) in Hamsadhwani in which kalpanaswaras incorporated neat poruthams. The structuring of the Ritigowla alapana revealed an earnest desire to dwell on essential features but needed punch and to-the-point statement to move beyond adequate to absorbing. The sprightly &#8216;Cheraraavadhemira&#8217; (Tyagaraja) supported niraval and swaram. Incidentally, the anupallavi sahitya concludes with &#8216;Maha Meru Dhira Srikara,&#8217; a line that the vocalists might want to confirm. The main alapana, Bhairavi, was refreshingly free of formula fare. Invigorating sorties issued from the panchama and the tara sthayi shadja.The sojourn at the tara sthayi rishabha yielded fine moments imbued with feeling and arising from spontaneous expression. &#8216;Sariyevaramma&#8217;(Syama Sastri), with its opening syllables marked by swarakshara endorsed undiluted classicism. The lengthy swaraprasthara reached the finish-line with flourish and intended effect. While not lacking in standard features, the sisters&#8217; presentation would have benefited from crisp outlines. T. Hemamalini (violin) was tuned to the same wavelength as the sisters. Kumbakonam Ramakrishnan (mridangam) and G.Ravichandran (ghatam) collaborated in a tidy tani.
