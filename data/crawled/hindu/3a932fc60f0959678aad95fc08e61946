VThere was more of flamboyance and less of sublimity  in Madurai Seshagopalan's vocal recital held under the auspices of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore,   this past week. The musician with a vibrant voice and high creative potential was at a break-neck speed  from the commencement of the kutcheri. The net result &#151;  sowkhyam in music became a casualty.The opening `Sree Gananatha' in Malahari was a majestic rendition followed by `Thelisirama' (Poornachandrika) with a pleasing niraval and swaras. The presentation vouched for his penchant for grandiloquence. `Anandanatamaaduvar Thillai' in Purvikalyani was reflective of his prolific manodharma. The raga vinyasams of Brindavana Saaranga for the Dikshitar kriti, `Sree Soundararajam Asraye' and Neelambari for the item, `Amba Neelayadakshi' were underscored by harshness of expression and glitzy brigas. The volley of swaras accompanying the niraval was over-stretched. A Kabir bhajan was soulful. Sreeramkumar met the challenging demands of the artiste's vocal depth with his bowing pressure. The percussive fire from Easwaran (mridangam) and Purushothaman (ghatam) was a good enough match to the artiste's vocal opulence.T.K.GANAPATHYBottom Template Starts
