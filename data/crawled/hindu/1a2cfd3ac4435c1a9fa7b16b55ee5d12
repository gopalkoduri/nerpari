VAccording to Dr. B.R.V. Prasada Murthy, be it Nannayya&#8217;s verse or that of Srinadha or even SriSri, poetry in general expresses the hopes, pain and joy of the human condition. Poetry is the treasure of human civilisation. In a recently released \u000aanthology and audio CD of poems in Telugu, titledMaatlaadukovaali,Prasada Murthy has shared some of these thoughts introducing each of his poems in the collection. The idea of the CD (with 29 poems selected from the book) was to brin\u000ag his poetry closer to the audience. It is a different matter of course that it also brings it closer to those who may not be able to read Telugu verse, yet are familiar with the Telugu language.The idea of the CD, according to Murthy was initiated by his NRI friend, Mr. R. Kumar, who has also supported its production. The CD was professionally recorded using the services of two well known Telugu dubbing artistes, R.C.M. Raju and Lenina Choudhary.Prasada Murthy recently gave up the luxury of a full time job &#8211; as head master of a school &#8211; to take up poetry. He has been writing poetry for many years now. His first anthology,Kaalanetawas published in 1999. It came\u000a in a context of dalit and feminist expression in Telugu literature and had its inspiration in that trend. It got him critical appreciation.Maatlaadukovaali(Must Talk / Need to Talk) is his second anthology of poems touching various \u000apersonal and larger subjects - the joy of seeing his little daughter grow up, or reminiscing her childhood days in a village, or expressing solidarity for Medha Patkar&#8217;s hunger strike, comment on the welcome given to George Bush, on Iraq war and aftermath, on rain and so forth. The CD will be released in New York sometime later this year.In an emotional moment, the poet talks about his mother. But mother here could also be a metaphor for the village that he left far behind &#8211; or the simplicity the rural context signified (for the poet) everyone has left far behind in the mad chaos of urban competitive life.The poet says - &#8220;ammanu chudalani undi ammalanti uru ni chudaanli undi sahukarugaru, mukhamninda i labellu...eppudu uda teestaaru...&#8221;(I want to see my mother, and the village that seemed like my mother...)Murthy said the anthology was released in the presence of eminent poets C. Narayan Reddy, K. Siva Reddy and Volga. He says he was very grateful these stalwarts praised his poetry as being fresh. Murthy&#8217;s life partner teaches in the Central school in Gachibowli and it is with her support that he has taken a decision to now dedicate his life to poetry as a vocation.Expressing his solidarity with Medha Patkar and her cause, he writes -&#8220;daya chesi aameni bratakanivvandi lakshalaadi nirvaasitula kannillanu aame tanakallallo daachukundi...&#8221;(Pray, let her live; for she carries in her eyes the tears of lakhs of homeless people...)Murthy says he was in anguish over the fact that people these days have no time to &#8216;meet&#8217; in the true sense of the term. In a context of deteriorating human relationships, there are no heart-connections possible anymore, he feels. It was this anguish that led him to write&#8220;jeevitamante pidikedu kalalu dosedu gnapakalu kalusukovadam nijaaniki okkarikokaru malli malli telusukodaanike kalayikale jeevitam....&#8221;He also makes his political perspective clear in his poem, &#8220;Bush, Malli Raavoddu&#8221;.Murthy looks forward to the release of his CD in New York sometime later this year which his friend Kumar has taken upon himself to accomplish.Meanwhile, he looks forward to feedback on his latest anthology and the CD.Bottom Template Starts
