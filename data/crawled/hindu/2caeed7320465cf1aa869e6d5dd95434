VRithigowla (Janani-Subbaraya Sastri), Nalinakanthi (Manavyalakinchara - Tyagaraja) and Shanmukhapriya (Ragam-Thanam-Pallavi) had none of those superfluous flourishes and the accent was pitched throughout on a serious initiative &#8212; stretching the noble string to arrive at the pinpointed swarasthana or intended gamaka &#8212; to directly mirror  the psyche of the artiste.Ananthapadmanabhan once  mentioned  that his technique was drawn from S. Balachandar. That evening there were many moments when this was made evident  &#8212; the Shanmukahapriya raga phrases and thanam structures that centred round some key succinct determinants of the raga with qualitative gliding jumps between octaves communicating a sense of excitement, handling of the bass string or presenting the split swaras with all its pure and weighty orientation imparting immense  pleasure. That was perfection that comes with long hours of sadhana.   The bhava-filled sangatis for &#8216;Jagamulo&#8217; (Janani) and &#8216;Avatharudai&#8217; (Manavylakinchara) spoke volumes of the internalisaiton of kritis on the part of the artist.T.V.Goplakrishnan (TVG) on the mridangam and T.V.Vasan (ghatam), both laya pundits, exercised caution and reserve. The thani had incomparable half avarthanam frills from TVG, who impressed with  subtleties on the left side.The swaram playing had an engaging phase with the veena and ghatam combining together to invoke answering phrases from the mridangam. This concert, organised by Nadopasana Music Trust was held at Swamy&#8217;s Hall.
