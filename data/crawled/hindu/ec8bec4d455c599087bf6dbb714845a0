VA three-hour, full-throated recital by veteran T.V. Sankaranarayanan was a musical homage to the memory of his guru and uncle Madurai Mani Iyer. It is but natural for a disciple to be enthused during such a concert dedicated to his guru, but TVS appeared inspired while giving his best to the audience. What added to the concert's attraction was the apt selection of compositions that highlighted the intrinsic traits of Mani Iyer, which had earned him the titles &#8216;Madhura (sweet) Mani' and &#8216;Mohana Mani.'The concert began with an invocation to Ganapathy. The virutham during which TVS stayed mostly in the upper sthayi served also as an alapana of Hamsadwani. The composition selected for this awe-inspiring rendition was Ganapathy Sachidananda Swamy's &#8216;Jaya Jaya Ganapathy' in Adi tala. The swraprasthara that was tagged to it was in the right measure.Evoked nostalgiaSoon followed &#8216;Naadathanumanisam,' a Tyagaraja composition in Chitharanjini. The elders among the audience could easily recall Mani Iyer's fascination for this nishadanthia raga in Adi. Purandaradasa's &#8216;Sakalagrabalaneene' in Atana and Khanta chapu was short and provided rhythmic variety.A remarkable feature of the concert was the musician's penchant to move in the upper octave in almost all numbers that provided an extra charm to the concert. Raga Chakravakam received an alluring delineation marked by highly melodious phrases. TVS chose to float in the swaras that were delivered in the right proportion for the composition of Papanasam Sivan's &#8216;Guruvayurappa' in Adi.For Kalyani, he chose the kriti &#8216;Himadri suthe pahimam' of Syama Sastri in Roopakam. The elaboration of the raga was very creative and one felt that he could have done more. But going by the format of his concert that entailed two major numbers and a ragam tanam pallavi (RTP) that were to follow, this appeared quite befitting.Perhaps the most bewitching part of this number was the niraval for which he chose &#8216;Syama Krishna sodari, Gowri Parameswari.' This manifested in umpteen aesthetic formations, enhancing the mood of the raga. The attempt to embellish every syllable was really laudable.Kapi, the next, also received an equal treatment. Perhaps the most commendable part of this number was a copious shower of swaras in doublets, triplets and quadruplets. Tyagaraja's &#8216;Intha soukyamathine' in Adi had a delectable tani attached to it by Thiruvarur Bhakatavalsalam on the mridangam and Vaikom Gopalakrishnan on the ghatam. True, there were fireworks but they were not overdone.Faithful reproductionV.V. Ravi's violin was noteworthy for the faithful reproduction of the meandering paths that TVS had chosen during the elaboration of the raga. A composition very dear to TVS, Papanasam Sivan's &#8216;Ka va va, kantha va va' in Varali and Adi tala, was the next choice. It bore the stamp of the musician's individuality.The RTP that followed embodied the sahithya &#8216;Parimala ranga pathe.' Interestingly, tanam executed in the higher octave was highly appealing. Transition from Kamboji to Behag and Sindhubhairavai was very smooth.Yamuna Kalyani appeared in the much sought-after composition of Vyasaraya, &#8216;Krishna nee begane baaro,' Misra chapu. This was preceded by an extended virutham in Tamil. Gopalakrishnabharati's &#8216;Eppo varu vaaro' in Jonpuri was rejuvenating. The finale was the Western notes for which Madurai Mani Iyer had a special reputation.The concert was held under the aegis of Rasikapriya at Regional Theatre, Thrissur.
