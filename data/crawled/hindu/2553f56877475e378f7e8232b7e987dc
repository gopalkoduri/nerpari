VThe close to three months Sasthapreeti celebrations (religious worship of Lord Dharmasastha) at various places in and around the Capital  came to a close recently. Elaborate cultural programmes, including puja, singing of traditional Ayyappa songs and  were organised as part of the celebrations at many places. But one   Bhagavatar who participated in  a celebration in neighbouring Noida created a lasting impression. Erode Rajamani, whose &#8216;Ayyappan bhajan&#8217; was organised by the Noida Hariharaputhra Samajam,  mesmerised the devotees and rasikas during his performance of close to three hours.Adhering to a traditional approach, Rajamani began his bhajan session with a song in praise of Lord Narayana. After Guru Vandanam he went on to present songs in praise of various deities. The subsequent and final session was devoted Lord Ayappa.Rajamani sang  virutham before every bhajan  and concluded the bhajan with namavalis &#8212; in which the names of the Lord are repeated to  increased tempo. Through the medium of  virutham, Rajamani presented fine sketches of  some of the ragas. These include Nattai, Hamsadhwani, Simhendra Madhyamam and Valaji. In the namavali section he took  the devotees  along with him. Rasikas and devotees could be seen repeating these comfortably and enthusiastically, leading to flow of communication  both ways. Rajamani himself was seen deeply involved with utmost devotion in the proceedings.All his supporting artistes rose to the occasion. Rajamani himself played the harmonium, which seemed to be used more for sruti support. As a result, the sketch of the ragas presented  on this instrument, on quite a few occasions soon after the  virutham, was  conspicuously absent. On the whole, a very neat presentation lifting the spirits of the devotees and rasikas.At another venue, again at Noida, the &#8216;homegrown&#8217; (read Delhi grown) Balagokulam group presented an impressive show under the aegis of the NTPC Ayyappa Puja Committee during their  fourth annual Sasthapreeti celebrations. The members of the group are Delhi-based, and many are youngsters. Their performance, mostly based on Carnatic ragas and on a few occasions Hindustani ragas, was admirable.At yet another venue, at Delhi&#8217;s Mayur Vihar Phase II, Kovai Jayaraman, a seasoned Baghavatar, was too &#8216;talkative&#8217; and &#8216;noisy&#8217; during his performance under the aegis the Sree Dharmasastha Seva Samiti. One felt that the interactive session with the devotees could have been cut down to a considerable extent to accommodate a few more bhajans.At Uttara Guruvayoorappan Temple, Mayur Vihar Phase I, Vechoor C. Shankar divided his timeslot equally into a Carnatic music session  and a bhajan session. Some serious music flowed during his Carnatic music session.Shankar thoughtfully presented Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Sree Krishnam&#8221; in the raga Todi in a very elaborate manner, bringing out the sahitya as well as the raga bhava of the composition. However, one felt that Shankar could have presented Tanjore Sankara Iyer&#8217;s composition &#8220;Mahadeva Shivasambho&#8221; in the raga Revati towards the end of his Carnatic music session, instead of presenting it as his second piece.
