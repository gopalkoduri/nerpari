VVasundhara Performing Arts Centre presented Bharatanatya by Shafeekudeen and Shabana on the second day of three-day national level dance festival, Natarajotsava-2010 in Mysore recently. Hussina Banu (Natuvanar - inspiring), Payanur Manoj (rich and pleasing voice), Hanumantharaju (mridanga-beat-patterns appropriate with the sequences) and Narayan (violin - emotively enhancing the moods) accompanied the dancers.The duo started their performance with Natarajanjali followed by a varna, &#8220;Ninne Nammithinayya&#8221; (Athana - Thuraiyur Rajagopala Sharma). Their performance was scholarly and sprightly: yet those merits were co-mingled with a few areas, which in a way marginally undermined the smooth flow of activities.The fast pace could not convincingly accommodate the movements that, as a result, fell short of expected completions. Theermana-s appeared hurried, though conformed to the rhythm. Further, both the artistes engaged themselves in presenting this varna and though they synchronised, it seemed as if two individuals were performing separately. Inclusion of significant artistic and thematic links in the choreography would have built an artistic bridge between the performers.The picture was entirely different when they performed individually: the overall approach accredited them without any reserve. &#8220;Aadum Paadanai&#8221; in praise of Lord Nataraja (Lathangi-Ambujam Krishna) demonstrated Shafeekudeen's composure and control over his expressions and movements.&#8220;Maamavathu Shri Saraswathi&#8221; (Hindola - Vasudevacharya) was an excellent illustration of Shabana's involvement. For example, the young danseuse portrayed Saraswathi's grandeur as the composer had visualised in the charana, &#8220;Rajadhiraja Pujitha Charana&#8221;.The recital included a tillana (Behag) neatly choreographed.***Vani Yadunandan presented a veena concert under the auspices of Ganabharathi, accompanied by H.L. Shivashankaraswamy (mridanga) and M.R. Manjunath (ghata).The concert started with Muthayya Bhagavathar's Daru, &#8220;Maathe Malayadhvaja&#8221; (Khamach). The movements followed a vocal style of narration and fully conveyed the essence of both the raga and the lyrics, well fortified by tightly knit progressions.It was a different impact when one observed &#8220;Aparadhamulanniyu&#8221; (Lathangi - Patnam). The alapana though instantly carried all the features facilitating quick identification, it fell short of emotion. With this, unique features of Lathangi fell short of that endearing comprehensive prelude which was indispensable for unfurling the supplicating mood inherent in a composition like &#8220;Aparadhamulanniyu&#8221;.Further, the pace, which the learned musician selected, could not support the tone of the text and depth of her imagination.Swaraprastara was sprightly than absorbing, in the light of the composition under consideration.She set most of the compositions in more or less a fixed framework, with alapanas preceding and the kalpanaswaras following the lyrics. &#8220;Mundu Venuka&#8221; (Durbar- Thyagaraja), &#8220;Neerajakshi Kamakshi&#8221; (Hindola-Dikshithar), &#8220;Evarura&#8221; (Mohana-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Thanayuni Brova&#8221; (Bhairavi &#8211; Thyagaraja - this presentation incorporated a short tani avarthana) vouched for the artiste's fluency and commitment.Nevertheless, the learned artiste could have made the articulations falter-free, with due care, particularly while materialising her gushing manodharma.&#8220;Raghunatha Nannu&#8221; (Swararanjani - Poochi Shrinivasa Iyengar), &#8220;Kurai Onru&#8221; (ragamalika - Rajaji), &#8220;Jagadhodharana&#8221; (Kaapi - Purandaradasa) and Thillana (Jhinjoti - Veene Sheshanna) were other interesting inclusions.
