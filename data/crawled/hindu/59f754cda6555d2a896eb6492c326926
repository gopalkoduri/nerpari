VVamshidhar's flute cast its\u000aspell on the audience\u000afrom the very moment of\u000aits beginning from "Shri\u000aGanapathini" (Sourashtra), a\u000acomposition from Thyagaraja's\u000a"Prahlada Bhaktavijaya". A\u000apeaceful ambience he instantly\u000acreated by his simple, unassuming\u000aand straight forward\u000aapproach, complemented with\u000aaesthetically refined artistry.\u000aHe dispelled the notion that it\u000ais only the technical embellishments\u000athat is capable of beautifying\u000aany composition, in his\u000aconcert at Mysore recently.He treads his path with a\u000asound understanding that it is\u000aultimately the ragabhaava and\u000asaahityabhaava, which can lay\u000aa strong foundation for any\u000amusical evolvement. In this respect,\u000a"Shri Ganapathini" by\u000avirtue of its majestic progressions\u000aadumbrated the magnitude\u000aof the musical values the\u000aconcert carried forth into the\u000arest of its length.As a rule, smooth fluency\u000acharacterised the articulations\u000aconnecting different swara\u000aconfigurations while developing\u000aGowrimanohari (for example),\u000aintroducing the listeners\u000ato "Guruleka Etuvanti"; similarly,\u000athe swaraprastara too\u000atastefully flavoured the presentation.He developed Kalyani (ragathana-\u000apallavi) predominantly\u000aon a thematic fashion. Endowed\u000awith impressive skill\u000aand delicacy, he expanded the\u000araga first in the mandra and\u000amadhya sthayi (elementary\u000aand indispensable rules of ragavisthara)\u000aand methodically\u000ascaled to higher octaves, allowing\u000asufficient time for the listeners\u000ato absorb and enjoy the\u000aserene beauty of Kalyani.When Kalyani progressed to\u000aSaramati, Abheri and Saama,\u000afragrance of devotion suggestive\u000aof "Mokshamu Galada",\u000a"Gokula Nilaya" and "Annapurne\u000aVishalakshi" spread itself\u000ainto the hall.Senior violinist, Mysore M.\u000aNagaraj's mature expertise\u000aideally complemented the flautist.\u000aThe percussionists, K.V.\u000aPrasad and G.S. Ramanuja\u000atreated the presentations as\u000aexpressions of melody and sublime\u000asentiments.***Bhushan's innovatively presented\u000aBharathanatya built on\u000athe theme Shoonya, as part of\u000aNruthya Bhushana, a Nationallevel\u000adance festival organised\u000aunder the auspices of Bhushan's\u000aAcademy of Performing\u000aArts and Visual Presentation.In the present instance, the\u000aartistes preferred to depict\u000aShunya to mean utter desolation\u000ato which Damayanti, Ahalya\u000aand Draupadi were\u000asubjected. Badari Divya\u000aBhushan's performance as Nala,\u000aDevendra, Gouthama and\u000aDuryodhana was outstanding\u000afor its romanticism, sensuality\u000aand asceticism as well. Anjana\u000aBhushan's abhinaya enlivening\u000athe female characters rose to\u000aappealing levels. Nevertheless,\u000athe performance ultimately\u000aleft in the minds of the spectators\u000aan overdose of sentimentality.\u000aHad the artistes\u000aconsidered the concept Shoonya\u000aas propounded by the\u000aBuddha and included some sequences\u000arelating to the Buddha's\u000alife, they could have\u000aachieved a better balance between\u000adifferent moods, with\u000amore diversity and versatility.Ramesh Chadaga (vocal),\u000aBrunda (natuvanga), Hanumantharaju\u000a(mridanga) and\u000aNarasimhamurthy (flute) constituted\u000athe music ensemble.
