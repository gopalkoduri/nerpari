VSwaramurthy N. Rao Memorial Trust organised a three-day music festival &#8220;Veeneya Bedagu&#8221; in Mysore, in memory of Veene Sheshanna, one of the luminaries of the Mysore Veena Baani.The Trust, recognising the services of Rajalakshmi Tirunarayanan, a veteran musician representing the Mysore style, honoured her with the Veene Sheshanna Smaraka Rashtriya Prashasti. T.N. Sheshagopalan was another doyen who received the Swaramuthy N. Rao Smaraka Prashasthi.Rajalakshmi&#8217;s inaugural veena concert provided the impelling force to the festival. Two more veena artistes, Rathnaprabha Krishna and Meera Raghu, joined her to enhance the impact. B. Ravishankar (mridanga) and Shashishankar (ghata) provided rhythm support.The recital commenced with Veene Sheshanna&#8217;s varna (Saveri-&#8220;Neerajakshi vinivamma&#8221;). With perfect synchronisation and soft intonations, the varna set to mishra jampe, exposed the devotionally supplicating mood of the raga and the imaginative musical faculty of the composer.In quick succession followed &#8220;Shri mahaganapathim&#8221; (Athana-Jayachamaraja Wodeyar), &#8220;Shri vighnarajam bhajeham&#8221; (Gambhiranata-Oothukaadu Venkatasubbayya) and &#8220;Manavyalakim&#8221; (Nalinakanti-Thyagaraja), without much significant features.From Dharmavati (&#8220;Tharamuga Paramatma&#8221;-Veene Sheshanna) onwards noticeable artistry started taking reasonable shape, and audience interest was kindled: the vinike was melodic and absorbing. Yet, in the alapana, spiky abrupt endings could have been avoided to facilitate the full resonance of the notes. Moreover, as the artiste restricted the elaborations to the slower paces, the musical potentials of the raga remained unexplored.. Madhyamavati (&#8220;Ramakatharasa&#8221;-Thyagaraja) featured a few excellent strains of thanas in ragamalika, in addition to pleasing alapana; swaraprastara led to attractive thani avarthana.*** T.N. Sheshagopalan sang on the second day, accompanied by H.K. Venkataram (violin), Cheluvaraju (mridanga) and Ramanujam (ghata).The mature artiste&#8217;s style displayed virtuosity and vivacity throughout, and the melodic aspects took a back seat, only with sporadic moments exemplifying excellent and absorbing progressions. Of the remarkable presentations, &#8220;Vanajaksha ni&#8221; (Rithigoula-Veena Kuppayya) stood first. A majestic approach to a disarming piece of imagination, complemented with absorbing and emotive jaarugamakas and alluring sancharas undoubtedly stood for the singer&#8217;s exceptional competence. Even the ettugade sections followed by elaborate swarakalpana supported the above observation. Nevertheless, protracted kalpanaswaras appended to a varna appeared redundant.&#8220;Vathapiganapathim&#8221; (Hamsadhvani-Dikshithar) also featured detailed swarakalpana, which supported rhythm rather than melody. Panthuvarali (&#8220;Shambhomahadeva&#8221;-Thyagaraja) was no exception. It featured a neraval at the charana, &#8220;Paramadhayakara mrigadhara&#8221;.A neraval at &#8220;Varaveenapani&#8221; at the charana section of Muthayya Bhagavathar&#8217;s Ambavani, led to such intricate strains of kalpanaswaras, that the rhythm accompanist&#8217;s expertise frequently fell into hardships, prompting hard strokes, compromising the melody. The singer could have avoided such movements and preserved the serenity of both Ambavani and Kiravani.Sadhana sprang into action in &#8220;Maayamma yani&#8221; (Ahiri-Shyamashastri) and &#8220;Thanayuni&#8221; (Bhairavi-Thyagaraja) treading a very different path: composure fortified with devotional fervour imparted melody and experience to these numbers.The violinist&#8217;s judicious stand was a relief for those who aspired for tuneful moments.
