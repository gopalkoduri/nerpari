VRANJANI GOVINDTyagaraja kritis that speak of management principles?   To many assembled at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan this past weekend, waiting to hear the subject get unravelled by Prof. V. Sivakumar from Maryland, U.S., it gave room for speculation. It was a nice gesture on the part of Music Education Trust and scholar T.R. Subramaniam to have given the Harvard University professor an opportunity to air his thoughts on these unconventional lines.Points of planningThe sheer novelty had drawn  senior musicologists  such as V.V. Srivatsa to the lecture-demonstration. ``Management principles or strategies are notper seexplained in the Telugu kritis of the saint, but if we look at the managerial points of planning, organising, directing or controlling to achieve a goal, Tyagaraja devoutly followed all these with his single-minded path of devotion (strategy) to achieve moksha (vision)," Sivakumar explained.``Just as several aspects of Tirukkural would make sense to people of any age at any point of time, Tyagaraja's simple principles of devotion are entwined with lessons to attain the goal with melodic grace. The kritis are an apt example for the 6-Sigma Principles of Total Quality Management that talk of not just attitude and work but tone and body language. His Nadopasana kritis in particular showcase him  as a positive strategist for realising a vision," he continued.But the real gems are Tyagaraja's works that explain the path of strategy and values &#151;  Nadopasana Kritis &#151;  the saint's myriad ways of worshipping the saptaswaras and constructive channelling of energies to attain moksha.As he explained each kriti, Salem Gayathri's neat and clear exposition of the kritis added lustre to the lecture demonstration.Some of them were, ``Nadasudharasa" (Aarabhi), Sangeetha Gnanamu (Dhanyasi), ``Ragasudharasa" (Andolika) ``Vararagalaya" (Chenchukambodhi) and ``Mokshamugalada" (Saramathi).Summing up Tyagaraja's management principles, Sivakumar concluded: Tyagaraja's Vision was to attain moksha, Mission &#151;  to worship nadams created by the saptaswaras, Strategy &#151;  create songs with shastram and gnanam, Implementation (tactics) &#151;  with rational explanations of his feelings in the kritis, Goals &#151;  satisfaction derived through singing, Mission accomplished  -   worship completed, and Vision realised  -   Sayjyam, being one with God, Sayujyam.Musical mantraHow did the professor of International Business see management tactics in Tyagaraja's works? Explains Sivakumar: ``Academics, in any form, has always fascinated me. Being a connoisseur of music, I am involved in Carnatic music proceedings in Washington and constantly in touch with senior musicians.  I happened to read the inspiring book of Tyagaraja's Nadopanana Kritis by T. S. Parthasarathy. Although the Saint's Kshetra Kritis are qualitative descriptions of the presiding deities, I could see the single-minded devotion recommended by Tyagaraja in his Nadopasana Kritis. In 14 of them he exhorts the worshipping of Nada to achieve moksha. ``I felt  the bard's works called for deeper contemplation.  This is when I realised I should study the core meaning, and apply it to the realm  of management, strategy and vision. The essence of these educative factors is what I perceive will make our day-to-day activities less complicated. It is what I call music's managerial mantra."Bottom Template Starts
