VThyagaraja Sangeetha Sabha had arranged flute concerts over three days in Mysore in memory of the legendary flute wizard T.R. Mahalingam. Young Varijashri entertained the audience on the second day, accompanied by another young musician, Udaykiran (violin), and senior percussionist V.S. Ramesh (mridanga).Varijashri has honed her style meticulously, and a refined music emanates from her instrument, neatly couched in a recognisable aesthetic fold. A definite order and methodical pattern had profound bearing on all movements.She introduced most of the presentations with either short or moderately drawn alapanas, preparing the audience for the respective lyrics. The concluding part of the alapana would evenly and smoothly extend into and merge with the composition &#8212; an approach interpreting the number as one musical unit.Patnam's &#8220;Chalamela&#8221; (Saveri) was the opening number, and the introductory alapana instantly shot positive indications. The alapana was analytical, with necessary pauses meticulously filled and complemented by the violinist's interludes.Alapanas in Saama (&#8220;Manasa Sancharare&#8221;-Sadashiva Brahmendra), Anandabhairavi (&#8220;Mariveregathi&#8221; -Shyamashastri) impressed the listeners on similar grounds. Subtleties were always her forte in expatiating the ragas, and the notes gently emerged with purity. Yet, an overall impression: though the progressions were melodic and pleasing, they missed an element of emotional warmth.Purandaradasa's &#8220;Jagadhodharana&#8221; (Kaapi) and &#8220;Venkatachala Nilayam&#8221; (Sindhubhairavi) were some of the other inclusions.***S.G. Suresh presented a flute recital on the concluding day. A senior artiste of high repute, true to the popular acceptance, he treated the chosen numbers with the required delicacies, backed with scholarship.Charged with the desired moods and emotions, the compositions naturally commanded wide appreciation from the listeners; the technical aspects serving the basic tenors the lyrics embodied, ultimately reflecting the composers' vision. The artiste has mastered an art of effecting apt accentuations, consistent with phonetic values, fostering the intended import &#8212; an ability, which may be rightly termed to his credit as tuneful pragmatic competence.He began his lively recital with Dikshitar's &#8220;Mahaganapathim&#8221; (Naata) preceeded by a short melodic overture. The swarakalpana section that followed illustrated the artiste's remarkable control over the instrument, creative imagination capable of exploring any raga he chose to its full extent and the art of presentation to the best of satisfaction of any serious listener.Believing in quality rather than quantity, the flautist packed every composition with varieties of gamakas and tastefully expanded sancharas while restricting the number of compositions.&#8220;Saarasaaksha Paripalaya&#8221; (Panthuvarali-Swathi Thirunal) illustrated all these observations. The presentation comprised a neatly expanded alapana leading to a sentiment-rich main body of the composition and prolific strains of swarakalpana artistically terminating in a variety of moharas.Veena Suresh's violin support equalled the lead artiste's fervour and repertoire; her alacrity could reproduce difficult movements the flautist spontaneously created with dexterity. Thus, a reciprocated creativity resulted in a healthy musical atmosphere, with which soft beats by the percussionists (P. Nataraj on mridanga and Manjunath playing ghata) harmonised admirably.&#8220;Ganamurthe&#8221; (Ganamurthy-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Thungathiravirajam&#8221; (Salagabhairavi-Padmacharan), &#8220;Naanaati Baduku&#8221; (Revathi-Annamacharya) and Thillana (Dhanashri-Swathi Thirunal) completed the list.
