VSVKA highly gifted felicitous voice ensured a soothing flow  to the concert of K. Gayatri under the auspices of Sri Thyagaraja Seva Samithi. The precise rendering of songs paying due respect to sahitya clarity was Gayatri&#8217;s  main strength. She proclaimed herself to be a well-groomed young artiste in the matter of refined creativity and highly cultured expressiveness.In style and substance, her music reflected fine voice control, the singular characteristic being soft lyricism and delicacy. This helped her to take the rasikas closer to the serene atmosphere of kritis as for instance, her presentation of &#8216;Sujana Jeevana&#8217; in Khamas and &#8216;Namorala&#8217; in Devagandhari. It was heart-warming to see Gayatri deploying her  succulent tone for real musical values and not for peripheral effect.A musician&#8217;s aesthetic instincts can be discerned by the way he or she negotiates sancharas in the tara sthayi in silken smoothness. Here Gayatri&#8217;s effort in alapanas was both rich in manodharma and intensity of feeling. It was impossible not to be stirred  by what she served, for rarely these days does a rasika come  across a young performer with such a potent combination of equanimity, conviction, idealism, talent and competence.The alapanas of Kalyani (&#8216;Evaramadugudura&#8217;) and Mohanam (&#8216;Nanu Paalimpa&#8217;) were cohesively designed. With slow soft steps she built up the sanchara  trellis the beauty of which was enhanced by melodic tints in cadences. There was not only much charm in the ragas&#8217; image but equal merit in it.The melodic scheme of the kirtanas was well preserved emphasising the emotional contents in mellow articulation which created a fine sense of relaxation.In every kirtana there was classical imprint speaking much of the kind of training the vocalist has received and also her steadfastness in sticking to it. If good music is an ascent from the rankly ritualistic to the subtly suggestive, Gayatri has this in good measure to take her to a higher level of performing standard.The violinist L. Ramakrishnan was equally well equipped to present the ragas in his solo session with great insight to handle graceful shades.There was strength in his bowing without making it harsh and the sancharas he played were clipped and clear.The mridangist K.V.Gopalakrishnan accompanied with great solicitude.Bottom Template Starts
