VSelecting a raga for pure classical expression is a difficult process. Sometimes it becomes a mere routine.  And at times, it seems that a raga chooses a person. Hamsadhwani is a beautiful Carnatic classical raga, which is popularly known and appreciated in North India.  The raga and the musician became one recently in Varanasi when Pandit Ronu Mazumdar presented it on his flute before the aesthetes. Ashok Kapur, on behalf of the well-established music organisation Kala Prakash, organised a four-day classical concert with Ronu Mazumdar, Shruti Sadolikar, Anjana Nath and others.  The artistes expressed the three ragas &#8211; Hamsadhwani, Maru Bihag and Nayaki Kanhada lucidly.Ronu-da performed raga Hamsadhwani in a graceful manner allowing it&#8217;s intrinsic purity to bloom. He entered into a mystic realm with his flute and allowed the notes of this raga to unfold in spontaneity. The first phase of Ronu-da&#8217;s recitation is marked by great intricacies, followed by flowing musical notes. For this, he uses moreandolanthankanaswith his delicately moderated breath. In slow tempo (Vilambit), he provides a rhythmic pace to the ascending notes which culminate in drut  layakari. He added a spark to the evening with a Pahadi dhun when  accompanied impeccably by Ram Kumar Mishra on the tabla.Next evening, Shruti Sadolikar took the stage. Shruti, a young talent from Jaipur Alladiya Khan gharana, started learning the basic nuances of gayiki from her father Wamanrao Sadolikar. Then she shifted towards the styles of Gulubhai Jasdanwalla to learn the same gharana in more depth.  Shruti is constantly making sincere efforts to preserve the purity of Jaipur gayiki. The ragas selected by Shruti, were Maru Bihag and Nayiki Kanhada. These ragas revealed their inner beauty through her competent and confident voice. Of course, Jaipur Maru Bihag unfolded its impulsive nature and romantic mood with specific touches of the Jaipur pattern.Upcoming artiste Anjana Nath from Kolkata, disappointed the audience by not being able to present the intrinsic flavour of raga Bhopali.
