Balamurali Krishna of Chennai at  Kalabharathi last Saturday. He was very ably accompanied on violin by Akkarai Subba Lakshmi and Chennai's B.V. Sivaraman onmridangam.Winner of many a laurel including the titles "Gaanamrithamani" and "Yuvakalaajyothi," Balamurali who is just 20  years old regaled the gathering with his recital . Going the whole hog with an arresting stage presence,  exploring and expounding soul stirring nuances ofraga, sahityaandlayabhaavamsextempore with poise, he kept even the noted connoisseurs bewitchingly  glued to their seats.Challenging repertoireBalamurali chose a challenging repertoire as well that defied his young  age. Getting  off to a tunefully grand start with theSahanavarnam, he renderedSiddhivinayakam(Shanmukhapriya) andParamatmuduvelige (Vaagadheeswari), both adorned with brief but beautifulaalapanaandswarakalpana. Then he elaboratedKaamakshi Bangaarukaamakshiof Syama Sastry (Varali) withneravuon the lyrical phraseSukhasyamale.NamovaasudevamofAnnamayyainSriraagam, Sitammamaayamma(Vasantha),Dvaithamu Sukhamaa(Reethigoula) andDenukaof Thyagaraja, all embellished with soul tickling essays ofragamandswaramwere rendered next in that order. Thethanion themridangamby Sivaraman at the end of theReethigoula kritias well was a wholesome treat.The virtuoso in Balamurali emerged in full bloom in theragam, tanamandpallavi(set toChaturasra JhampeinKhandanada) inKambhoji. Subba Lakshmi on violin proved to be a peer to Balamurali with matchingragaandswaraessays on the instrument.
