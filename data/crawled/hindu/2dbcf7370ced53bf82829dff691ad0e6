VRajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore, featured the violin recital by Athira.Her nimble fingers danced at her will. When she played at incredible speed, the listener had to hold his breath, but she glided through it and made a smooth landing. She poured forth swaras that were soft and caressing when she depicted ragas such as Charukesi, but fast and fiery as she played the English note by Muthaiah Bhagavathar. But it is to her credit that never once did she resort to gimmicks. Her music remained pure though it was dressed in a livelier attire that day.Delightful depictionHer selection of compositions took care of the lively aspect of her concert. She began with the Kalyani varnam, &#8216;Vanajakshi' and passed on to &#8216;Vaathaapi Ganapathim' after a delightful depiction of Hamsadhwani. After its dazzle, the slow, soft and soothing &#8216;Akhilaandeswari' in Dwijavanti appeared. Again, after the brisk &#8216;Samayamidhe Naannu Brochutaku' in Budhamanohari, she presented the rare kriti &#8216;Saamodham Chinthayaami' in Suddhadhanyasi by Swati Tirunal.Charukesi and Kharaharapriya were also dealt with elaborately for the kritis &#8216;Aadamodi Galade' and &#8216;Pakkala Nilabadi,' both by Tyagaraja. The lighter session included &#8216;Paayoji Maine,' a Meera bhajan, &#8216;Krishna Nee Begane Baaro' and &#8216;Karunai Seivaan' besides the usual favourites.Madippakkam Suresh on the mridangam and Adambakkam K. Shankar on the ghatam formed an excellent partnership. As expected, their thani was remarkable. They &#8216;stood out' with their &#8216;under-play' throughout the concert, adding an unobtrusive sheen to Athira's performance.
