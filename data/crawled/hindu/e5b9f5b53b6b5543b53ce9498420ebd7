VFlautist Nagaraju enthralled the audience with his high quality flute recital during the weekly concert held  under the banner of Nada Bharathi. Nagaraju is a disciple of the late Manda Balarama Sharma, a renowned flautist from Hyderabad and an A-grade artiste with decent experience. Having rich sruthi suddhata, his blowing technique is extremely good. His attitude towards music strictly follows the great Mahalingam approach, which reflects in his performance.The recital began with a Navaragamalika. Hamsadwani was briefly expanded in Dikshitar&#8217;sVatapi, with detailed swarakalpana focusing on avrutham swaram.  Nagaraju renderedSree Rama Padamain Amritha Vahini with devotion before moving on to Thyagaraja&#8217;s famous numberRaghuvamshain Kadanakuthuhalam. The tempo was fast, maintaining the clarity in the sancharas.The main attraction of the concert was a detailed expansion of Saraswathi ragam. Nagaraju revealed the classic sangathis of the raga with rich bhavam. However, he could have selected a Ghanaragam for expansion instead of Saraswathi. Nevertheless,Anuragamulelaof Thyagaraju was the krithi and was played very effectively with catchy swaram.Rajashekar, a young violinist, was a fine accompanist and his Saraswathi ragam was good. The mridangam accompaniment was also strong and the tani in Rupakam was neat.The concluding items were Purandara&#8217;sJagadhoDharanain Kapi and a Thillana in Dhanashree, both of which were neatly played by Nagaraju with good feel of the raga. On the whole it was a mature performance with good technique and patanthara, making it an enjoyable evening.
