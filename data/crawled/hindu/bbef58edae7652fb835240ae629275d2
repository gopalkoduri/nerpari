VVisakha Music and Dance Academy&#8217;s auditorium Kalabharathi witnessed quite a prodigious exercise - a full fledged concert of carnatic music on keyboard last Tuesday. Fulfilling all aspects of the well popularised format of artistic exposition of\u000a the tradition, 12-year old K. Satyanarayana from Chennai, a VII standard student, artfully accomplished all intricacies of expression of the manodharma he systematically imbibed. Thus he left an impression of being a thorough professional including the attitudinal tints of charming appearance on the stage.Handling the keys and the contrivances provided for changing their tonality with kid gloves, he made it mostly appear a child&#8217;s play surfacing and sustaining the carnatic fervour flawlessly for most of the time on the western instrument.Also adept at western music and credited with more than 300 recitals in almost all Sangeetha sabhas in India and recording three volumes of carnatic music, he kept one and all awe struck.Abhogi varnam, Gam Ganapathi (Hamsadhvani), Sobhillu Saptaswara (Jaganmohini), Pancharatnakriti Endaromahanubhavulu (Sri)prefixed withaalapana, Garudagamana (Naagaswarali),all of Thyagaraja,Krishna \u000aNee Begane (Yamunakalyani),a composition of his own inVakulabharanam, Raagasudharasa (Andolika)concluded withswaram, elaboration ofMarivere (Anandabhairavi), Om Namonarayana (Karnaranjani)andragam, tanamandpallaviinShanmukhapriyainAditalamconstituted his repertoire.Karaikal Venkatasubrahmanyam on violin, Thillaisthanam Suryanarayanan from Chennai on mridangam and K.V.
