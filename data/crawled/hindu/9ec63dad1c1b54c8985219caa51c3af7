VDr. Jothi Kausalya, an Ayurvedic Physician who has composed many verses in praise of deities such as  Meenkulathi Bhagavathi,  Kamakshi, Lakshmi Narasimhar and  Ramar has brought out a translation of both Bhajagovindam and Gnanapaanai for the benefit\u000a of the Tamil speaking world.The Tamil translation of Bhajagovindam sung in different ragas in the presence of  Swami Dayananda Saraswathi  has won the accolades of many. Encouraged by this, the physician, at the instance of Geetha Varma of Arya Vaidya Pharmacy undertook a translation of Poonthana Kavi&#8217;s &#8216;Gnanapaanai&#8217; into Tamil which forms the latter half of the sleek volume.Narayaneeyam, an extempore composition in elegant and lucid Sanskrit, was sung in praise of the Lord of Guruvayoor by Narayana Bhattathiri. The recitation of Narayaneeyam is considered to be one of the items of offerings in Guruvayoor. A contemporary of Bhattathiri, Kavi Poonthanam was also an ardent devotee of Lord Krishna and he brought a revolutionary change in the lives of the people saying that Namasmaranam was the only way to reach God.  Emphasising the futility of material existence he brought home the value of service to the Lord by undertaking Nama japa as an easy means to attain moksha. He composed Gnanapaanai in Malayalam which continues to be recited even now by the Keralites. At the end of each verse, the namajapa of &#8216;Krishna Krishna Mukunda Janardhana,&#8217; bespeaks the poet&#8217;s stress on the repetition of nama sankeerthanam.Meena Subramaniam with the vocal support of Sruthilaya and  Lakshmi rendered the Tamil verses of Gnanapaanai in different Carnatic ragas with devotional fervour in Melpathur auditorium, Guruvayoor, to the accompaniment of Ganesan on the violin and Ramachandran on the mridangam.Priced at Rs. 20, this slender volume has been brought out by Arsha Vidya Gurukulam, Anaikatti, Coimbatore.
