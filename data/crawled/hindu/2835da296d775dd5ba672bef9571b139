VPravin Godkhindi&#8217;s &#8220;Colours of the Bamboo&#8221; (organised by Jagruthi Nagarika Vedike, Jayanagar, at H.N. Kalakshetra) flagged off with classical Yaman, the raga portrayed in a systematic, not-in-a-hurry approach. &#8220;I will start wi\u000ath a classical session and move on to fusion in the second part,&#8221; announced the flautist, even as the prominence given to the raga bhava and the permutations and combinations of his aesthetic flow of swaras more than explained the Kirana Gharana in which Pravin has been groomed by his father-and-guru, Venkatesh Godkhindi. &#8220;The raga gets more evolved and its  purity  emerges in this special &#8216;gaayaki ang&#8217; style  in the alaap, jod and the brisk tans,&#8221; explained Pravin. The excitement of the style gained extra momentum with super fast taans where the raag was showcased with criss-cross phrases running between two to three swaras adding another dimension to the scale.Explaining the nuances of the raag and the style is Pravin&#8217;s forte as he believes that teaching helps the audience co-relate and enjoy his presentation. His unfolding is not just meditative in approach; straight notes, noteworthy pauses, vocal interpretations, expressive patches handled at both upper and lower octaves and a body language  all bring in the much-needed charisma to his show. The soft echoing of layakari from the two tabla players (Kiran Godkhindi and Madhusudan) and  the punctuated notes on keyboard (Umesh) worked as garnishing  to the concert.As the feverish round of applauses surfaced far too often, it was more than clear that there were takers for both streams&#8230; the serious unfolds of the classical school and the more glamorous part of the evening &#8211; fusion. And with fusion came along the thunderous pace setter Arun Sukumar with live drums. Isn&#8217;t this &#8216;jump into jamming&#8217; a sudden change on stage for Pravin where traditional play gives way to modern strokes? &#8220;Classical presentation has rules but in the so-called Pravin-fusion there is swara-laya-raga-tala in a re-assembled manner, not exactly in an order. If the afternoon raag Bhimplas is handled at night, is it called a crossover? If you notice, the keyboard, drums and tabla are a subdued ensemble  to enhance the charm. The tihayis explain my brush with Carnatic school too. Isn&#8217;t this a fairly cool package?&#8221; queries Pravin.The drums thumped, the keyboard mellowed in and the tablas gained renewed power&#8230; the fusion had Pravin come along with a shrill melody of Malkauns on his smaller flute which brought in a folk-kind of a piece with off-key notes (anya swar) infusing in a jazz effect too. The deluge of melody in several combinations also included vocals and well-known film numbers in each piece.The mood of walking amidst the mountainous range with birds humming around rippled waters came about in Mishra Pahadi, the atmosphere gaining impetus with the elaboration of the film song, &#8220;Dhoni Saagali Munde Hogali, Doora Teerava Serali.&#8217; &#8220;The soft flow is to describe the pastoral setting, the beats have to be there to define the temperament,&#8221; says Pravin.RANJANI GOVINDBottom Template Starts
