VSantana Gopalan is one of India&#8217;s best Carnatic vocalists and whatever he sings, it adheres toSastra. Presenting his concert for SICA as part of its Golden Jubilee festival, in the company of M.A.Sundaresan on violin,Chennai&#8217;s K.V.Prasad on mridangam and Hyderabad&#8217;s P.V.Ramanamurthy on Ghatam, Santana Gopalan opened with VasantharagaVarnam with a fluentswarakalpana.Tulasi Dalamurlache, a Thyagaraja composition in Mayamalavagowla withneravuandswarakalpanathat followed was appealing.Varali came for a brief delineation and rendered popular numberKaavava Kandaa, withsahitya prasthara (neravu) andswaraprasthara, keeping up the melodic line.The otherragahe essayed was Nalinakanti forNatajanapalini,a Tanjavur Sankarayyer&#8217;s composition. Theswarakalpanawas the dominating aspect in higher speed in Tisram. The majorragaof Gopalan&#8217;s concert was Bhairavi.This popularragarevealedhis expertise.  The latter part of the concert has some classical and devotional numbers.Rajesh Vaidhya, disciple of Veena Chittibabu called his concert as a &#8216;fusion show&#8217;.But it was far from it. One dominating factor was his full command on veena. If the addition of key board, electronic drums and tabla contributed to his fusion theme, it was his definition. There were also traditional instruments - mridangam and ghatam.The entire show sounded more like a concert in a hurry.There was no rest from the openingGambhira nata varnamof Balamuralikrishna, toVinayakain Hamsadhwani and toNiravdhi Sukhadain Ravichandrika.Ragam Valajiin Misrachapu was his next number. Tabla interposed in between with some sounds here. For what? We didn&#8217;t know. The key board and electronic drums too intruded now and then but were never conducive with the traditional instruments. His body language with his long hair swinging to sides also added to this eccentric mood.More than projecting the pieces, Rahesh got himself projected as a wizard of Veena. Even the breezy numberRaghuvamsain Kadanakutuhalam had some extra speed.He concluded the show with his guru Chittibabu&#8217;s numberWedding Bells, besides a couple of light classical numbers.
