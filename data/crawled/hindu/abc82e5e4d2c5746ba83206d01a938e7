VCarnatic music concerts organised in connection with the Nritta Sangeethotsav held as part of the Sivarathri celebrations at the Sree Vadakkunnathan Temple, Thrissur, comprised two vocal and one instrumental recital.P. Unnikrishnan had an impressive start with the Adi tala varnam, &#8216;Eranapai itham chowka seya meragadura,' a composition in Todi by Kothavasal Venkatarama Iyer. Next he chose two Tamil compositions &#8211; &#8216;Sivaloka nathanai' in Mayamalavagowla, Roopaka tala, and &#8216;Pirava varam tharum' in Latangi, Adi tala. While the former by Gopalakrishna Bharathi was noted for its vigorous delivery, the latter, a composition of Papanasam Sivan, captured the imagination of the rasikas for the ingenious way in which the musician painted the picture of Latangi. The Swati composition he had selected was &#8216;Mamava jagadiswara' in Saraswathimanohari, Adi tala.Alluring phrasesThen Unnikrishnan wove alluring phrases of Bhairavi while essaying the raga in an exhaustive manner. The composition was &#8216;Upacharamulanu che konavayya uraga rajasayana.' Rhythmic interludes by Kuzhalmannam Ramakrishnan (mridangam) and Tripunithura Radhakrishnan (ghatam) were interesting but there were moments when the rendition appeared more percussion-oriented. But the duo did an inspiring tani for this main raga of the concert.The musician's favourite &#8216;Pibare Rama rasam' in Ahirbhairav and Vyasaraya's enchanting composition in Yamunakalyani, 'Krishna nee begane baro,' followed before the tillana in Hamsanandi with which he wound up the concert.The only instrumental concert in the festival was by flautist Kudamaloor Janardanan, who appeared restless. Still the concert was an attempt for improvisations in total. He was accompanied by Vaipeen Satheesh on the mridangam and Hari Krishnamurthy on the tabla.T.R. Subramanian's Adi tala varnam in Behag was the opening number. The presentation was his own creation based on an original composition of TRS. It had a lengthy alapana, quite unusual for a varnam. Interestingly, for scaling down the sthayis, he selected the longer and thicker bansuris.The Swati composition in Manirangu, &#8216;Jaya jaya Padmanabha,' had an elaborate treatment. The rendition had several swara progressions, but many of them left much room for improvement in respect of musicality. A short number in Nagaswaravali in Khanda chapu after, he took up another Swati composition. &#8216;Chaliye sunder,' being a kriti in a Hindustani raag Brindavanasaranga in teen taal, the percussion support was the tabla alone. The rhythmic flourishes by Hari were well received by the audience.A stimulating concert that regaled the audience for more than two hours was presented by T.M. Krishna. His full-throated delivery throughout the concert left a memorable punch. Moreover, purity of sruti and remarkable ability to traverse through the octaves with ease appeared to be his hallmarks.SwaraprastharasWorth mentioning were his selections as well. The swaraprasthara in the opening number &#8216;Manasu nilpa sakthi lokabothe,' the Tyagaraja composition in Abhogi, was vigorous. Papanasam Sivan's composition in Natabhairavi, &#8216;Sree valli devasenapathe,' was equally energetic. Kedaragowla received a neat alapana for the number &#8216;Thulasibilva mallikadi,' another Tyagaraja kriti. T.H. Subramaniam rose to the occasion by delineating an alluring repetition of the same.A brisk Panthuvarali was clothed in the Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Siva Siva enarada.' The alapana of Sankarabharanam was an analytical exploration of the nuances of this sampoorna raga. The tani by K. V. Prasad (mridangam) and Uduppi Sreedhar (ghatam) was scholarly.The bhajan &#8216;Jaya jaya Sankara hara hara Sankara' (Kanada) was quite befitting to the occasion. Interestingly, Krishna's prowess to go to the lowest octave possible was well demonstrated in this number. His favourite, Gopalakrishna Bharathi's composition in Behag, &#8216;Irakkam varamal,' was most soothing.
