VThis well-known story was presented as &#8216;Parvathi Parinayam,&#8217; a dance drama by the students of Sridevi Nrithyalaya, Chennai, on the first day of the five-day music, dance and drama festival at Mahatma Gandhi Mandapam, Pollachi. The occasion was the 37th anniversary of Pollachi Tamizhisai Sangam.Guru Sheela Unnikrishnan&#8217;s choreography brought out her creative ability, and  the way she trained so many participants young and old, spoke volumes of her organising skill. She exploited every possibility for exhibiting the dancing skill of her students. The bridal procession was  impressive, comprising all kinds of celestial and terrestrial beings. (The bootha ganas were too conspicuous to miss.)The marriage scenes were well-researched and each and every ritual in a formal wedding was included. The lovely-looking divine couple added to the impressiveness of the show. The recorded music was of good quality. The lyrics were meaningful; the tunes suitable to the occasion and the singers sang them with clarity and involvement.Those who did not attend the veena duet by Mudikondan S.N.Ramesh and Malathi Krishnamani on the second day  certainly missed something. The brother-sister  duo showed great imagination and versatility. They belong to the Mudicondan School of Music, having been trained under their father Mudicondan S. Narayanaswamy Iyer, a senior disciple of Mudicondan Venkatarama Iyer.They began with &#8216;Evvari Bodhana,&#8217; the varnam in Abhogi (Patnam Subramania Iyer). &#8216;Mooladhara Moorthi&#8217; by Papanasam Sivan was presented with lovely swarakalpanas. They took Hindolam (&#8216;Maa Ramanan Uma Ramanan&#8217;) and Thodi (&#8216;Thaaye Yasodha&#8217;) for elaboration. During the alapanas, their individualistic styles blended beautifully. They played only familiar songs so that the audience could identify them. &#8216;Thodudaiya Sevian&#8217; (thevaram), &#8216;Raghuvamsa Sudha&#8217;, &#8217;Chinnanjiru Kiliye&#8217;, &#8216;Aarumo Aaval&#8217;, &#8216;Eppadi Padinaro&#8217; and the kilikkanni were some of the popular pieces which were thoroughly enjoyed by every one. A.S.Ranganathan on the mridangam and A. Sivarama Krishnan on the ghatam gave a spirited display of their skill.Later, there was a bharathanatyam recital by the students of UDIMAT (Udumalpet Indian Medical Association Trust) Pandanallur Natyalaya. After the Pushpanjali, Ganapathi Kauthuvam (Nattai) and Natesa Kauthuvam (Hamsadhwani) were presented.The dancers depicted the important episodes of the ten avatars of Mahavishnu for the varnam, &#8216;Parkadal Meethinil Paiya Thuyilgindra&#8217; in ragamalika by Pandanallur Srinivasan. &#8216;Villinai Otha Puruvam Valaiththanai Velava&#8217; by Bharatiyar was presented beautifully.The episode of Murugan&#8217;s approaching Valli was given in detail and Diksha Purushothaman as Valli and S.Vividhya as Murugan were convincing. They concluded their recital with the tillana in Amir Kalyani, also by Pandanallur Srinivasan. R.Nivedha, G.Srigowri, and K. Abhinaya were the other students who did their guru proud. The supportive orchestra consisted of Girish (vocal support), Guru Pandanallur Pandian (nattuvangam), Veeramani (violin) and Mayavaram Viswanathan (mridangam).On the first day, Actor Satyaraj was awarded the title, &#8216;Navarasa Nadippu Sudar&#8217; for his performance in &#8216;Periyar&#8217; and &#8216;Onbathu Rubai Nottu&#8217;.There were two humorous plays on successive days &#8216;Kalakkara Machi&#8217; (Sathya Sai Creations, Chennai) and &#8216;Plastic Kadavul&#8217;(United Visuals). On the concluding day, there was a vocal recital (only Tamil songs) by O.S.Thiagarajan, with Karaikkal S.Venkata Subramanian on the violin and Thirukkokarnam R.Krishna Murthi on the mridangam.
