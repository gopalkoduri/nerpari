VLALITHAA KRISHNANIn the space of a year, the Trichur brothers (Srikrishna and Ramkumar Mohan) have made significant strides in honing their presentation skills and strengthening the content of their recital. Their voices have gained in timbre, with punch and fluency in articulation.Alapanas saw the siblings alternating to impart contrasting and complementary shades. The initial portion of the concert laid emphasis on the presentation of a succession of kritis with apt kalapramana and fidelity to patanthara.The relaxing strains of Shankarabharanam soothed even as the measured tread of the Ata tala varnam established a strong lead. Two Muthuswami Dikshitar kritis `Ganarajena' (Arabhi) and `Diwakara Tanujam' (Yadukula Khambodi),  were sung with involvement and due respect for the lyric.In the Mayamalavagowla raga, open-voiced singing  added impact to panchama-centred prayogas and medium-fast passages at the tara stayi shadja. The Semmangudi favourite, Swathi Tirunal's `Deva Deva Kalayamithe' supported a busy fretwork of niraval and sarvalaghu swaras that retained proportion.Muthuswami Dikshitar's `Ananda Natana Prakasam' (Kedaram) and Tyagaraja's `Koluvaiyunnade' (Devagandhari) were solid stepping-stones to the main delineation in Varali. Well-defined stages in raga development and continuous loops of sancharas at the shadja reinforced raga identity.In Papanasam Sivan's `Kaa Vaa Vaa,' the swara sallies in different nadai permutations created a swirl of interesting patterns landing on the line `Pazhanimalai Urayum Muruga.'The violinist, Avaneeswaram Vinu's interpretations of a serene Mayamalavagowla and gamaka-enriched Varali captured attention with their resonant tone, continuity of phrasing and strong bowing.Trichur Mohan and D.V.Venkatasubramaniam offered sturdy support and their thani, subdued and forceful by turns, was absorbing.Bottom Template Starts
