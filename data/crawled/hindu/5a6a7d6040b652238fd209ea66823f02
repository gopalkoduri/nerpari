VBalasubramanya Sharma, accompanied by Dr. R. Raghuram (violin), B.S. Anand (mridanga) and S. Srishylan (ghata) presented a vocal recital at the MES Kalavedi, Bangalore, recently.The concert began with &#8220;Sarasuda&#8221;, the adi tala varna in Saveri and continued with a brief outline of Athana and the krithi &#8220;Sreemahaganapathim Bajeham&#8221;, also in adi tala, rendered at a sedate pace and rounded off with a few short kalpana swaras. Mayamalavagoula was then elaborated in some detail, revealing its unique identity in a series of soft, well-rounded sancharas. While Swathi Tirunal's &#8220;Deva Deva Kalayami&#8221; in rupaka thala was sung in a brisk tempo and supplemented with a neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Jatharupa Nibhachela&#8221;, there were a few inaccuracies in the subsequent sahithya of the charana. A melodious sketch of Hamir Kalyani was then succeeded by &#8220;Venkatashaila Vihara&#8221; in adi tala, rendered in an appealing kalapramana.Madhyamavathi was taken up for an expansive alapana that included multiple phrases around each note, with the artiste's manodharma highlighting the gentler facets of the raga. The clarity and steadiness of voice in the mandra sthayi during the final descent was especially notable. Vocalist and accompanists synchronised splendidly in the rendition of the Thyagaraja composition &#8220;Ramakatha Sudha&#8221; in adi tala, which also incorporated a neraval at &#8220;Bhamamani Janaki&#8221;, kalpana swaras ending with a spate of diminishing avartanas at the tara sthayi shadja, and a sparkling tani avartana.Among the concluding items were the sloka &#8220;Ramaya Ramachandraya&#8221; set to a haunting Hindolam and prefixed to &#8220;Devadevam Bhaje&#8221; in khanda chapu thala.***The M.A. Narasimhachar Music Foundation hosted a vocal concert by Aishwarya Vidya Raghunath last week, accompanied by Aditi Krishnaprakash (violin) and C. Cheluvaraju (mridanga).While a brisk beginning was made with the Suruti varna in adi tala, the ensuing items including Thyagaraja's &#8220;Chinnanadena&#8221; in Kalanidhi raga and adi tala were indicative of a wide repertoire of ragas and compositions. A systematic exposition of Purvikalyani raga, replete with well-modulated phrases, was followed by &#8220;Jnanamosagarada&#8221; in rupaka tala, incorporating a lively neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Paramathmudu Jeevathmudu&#8221;. Shyama Shastri's &#8220;Brovavamma&#8221; in Manji, a fine choice, was presented with due consideration to the gravity of the composition, attesting to the artiste's dedication and devotion to tradition.Begada was elaborated next, with a clear emphasis on the madhyama and the nishada, and followed by the Deekshithar krithi &#8220;Thyagarajaya Namasthe&#8221; in rupaka tala. Thyagaraja's &#8220;Nenarunchera&#8221; in the rare raga Simhavahini, a derivative of Sarasangi, was prelude to the main raga of the evening, Todi. The young vocalist displayed remarkable maturity, improvisational ability and aesthetic acumen in the heavy gamaka infused alapana that remained true to the conventional image of the raga. &#8220;Koluvamaregada&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in adi tala, was presented with a comprehensive neraval of the sahithya beginning &#8220;Sreekarunikashritha&#8221;, and kalpana swaras that projected raga bhava without rhythmic excesses and included an engaging stint around the panchama. The violinist, also a young artiste, displayed commendable prowess and promptness in her responses, while the unstinted support and expertise of seasoned percussionist enhanced the overall impact.
