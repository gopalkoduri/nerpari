VG.S. PAULA soothing flute recital was presented by Nagamangalam Raghavan at Sahithya Akademi Hall in Thrissur. Melody appeared to be the forte of Raghavan.He began his two-hour concert with `Siddhi vinayakam.' Muthayya Bhagavathar's composition in Mohanakalyani raga, Adi tala, was evocative of the phrases he wove for delineating the raga. `Entharo mahaanu bhavalu,' the Pancharatna kirtana of Tyagaraja in Sree raga, Adi tala, followed. While the short but sweet alapana created the intrinsic mood of the raga, rendering of the kriti conveyed the message of the composition.Painting myriad shadesAs he switched over to Poorvikalyani, it was evident that he preferred to paint the myriad shades of a raga before delving into the kriti, however short it might be.The popular Tyagaraja composition `Jnanamusarakada' in Rupaka tala stood out owing to the  distinct style of `avarohana' he resorted to.`Brova bharama' in Bahudhari, a Tyagaraja composition in Adi tala,  highlighted the mood of the lyrics of the kriti. After a brief `Gurulekha etuvanthi' in Gourimanohari in Khanda chapu, Raghavan chose Kamas as the main raga of the evening. Raghavan chose to play `Brochevare varuva,' Mysore Vasudevacharya's kriti,  with a bansuri.Among the light numbers, `Venkatachala nilayam' of Purandaradasa in Sindhubhairavi, lingered in the minds of the listeners.Accompaniment provided by C. Rajendran (violin), Jayakrishnan (mridangam) and G. Manoharan (ghatam) was noteworthy.Raghavan, who is Director of AIR and Doordarshan Kendra, Thrissur, is a disciple of the late V. Desikachar.A graduate in music from Mysore University, he has also won many awards of the Karnataka Government.The programme called `Breeze n Wind' was organised by Bharatham.Bottom Template Starts
