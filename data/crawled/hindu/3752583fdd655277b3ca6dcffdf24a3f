VThe  voices blend seamlessly though one of them has a husky tenor.  Their approach  banks  on sincerity and restraint.With the Sriraga varnam as their starting point the siblings provided a musical excursion with little  ostentation. In &#8216;Meru samana&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla) niraval and swaras surfaced at &#8216;Kala muna sobillu.&#8217;The three ragas qualified for dissertation for the evening were Sahana, Poorvikalyani and Khambodi.The Poorvikalyani alapana by Geetha was a well conceived and uncomplicated presentation. Here the composition also elevated the importance through Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Paripoorna kama&#8217; with an intricate matrix of chittaswaram that showcased the finer facets and swara splendour of Poorvikalyani.Sahana in brief and Khambodi in detail were Uma&#8217;s share. The visions were flawless but due to her constraints in getting past the upper notes, the overall version slightly fell short of expectations.It is better if the sisters deploy stronger statements with longish motif instead of fully banking on shorter phrases in raga exposition.&#8216;Giripai nela&#8217; in Sahana (Tyagaraja) and the uncommon &#8216;Emayya rama&#8217; in Khambodi (Bhadrachala Ramdas) were good selections and substantiated with potent presentations.The niraval in &#8216;Narudavani narula dama doravanasu yadhavulu&#8217; set at an enjoyable tempo followed by swara sallies.The duo does not opt for  long-winding  duals. The swaras were crisp and  aesthetically strung.  Vasanthabhairavi (&#8216;Rama ramana&#8217;), Atana (&#8216;Sakalagraha&#8217;), &#8216;Varuvaro varam tharuvaro&#8217; (Sama) and &#8216;Prathyankira bhagavatim&#8217; in Nadanamakria came as vivid interlude fillers.Shertalai Sivakumar  was rather  cryptic in his responses both in raga essays and  kalpanaswara.Melakkaveri Balaji on the mridangam and H. Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam, on the other hand, were a picture of bonhomie, providing perfect rhythm at the right decibels.
