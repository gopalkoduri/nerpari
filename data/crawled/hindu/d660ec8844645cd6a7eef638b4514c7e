VYella was his robust self with rather soft launch of his beat steadily rising to a crescendo in his inimitable style throwing challenge after challenge at Vikram Ghosh who was no less competent to take it in his stride.If the mridangist weaved magic on his percussion the younger contender showcased his wizardry on the tabla. Both created waves of rise and fall in tempo which was exciting to the audience. Techniques and stylistic gradations followed with each establishing his brand of mastery over the respective instruments. Rhythmic accuracy was Yella&#8217;s forte while Ghosh could produce melody with just a tap of his deft fingers. It was like a game where each player excelled the other up to the winning post leaving the viewers charmed and confused to declare the best of the two.Hariharan&#8217;s ghazal night did not generate the expected warmth on a rainy night. His mellifluous voice needs no certification. But his &#8216;so-called&#8217; improvisations of ghazal rendition which is often touted to be spacious enough to innovate did not create the desired effect. The lyrics of ghazals are often charged with romanticism and sentiment of the dreamy variety which calls for soft, emotive tones. Hariharan&#8217;s bhol rendition and gimmicks were more akin to a khyal while the soul of the ghazal got smothered. No sooner than he sang the notes of a Kamal Rizwi&#8217;sTum hakeekat hoor a Mehdi&#8217;spatta patta, bhuta, bhuta&#8230;sans instrumental accompaniment and the audience started savouring the beauty of the lines, he springs into one of his improvisations transforming the very soul of the ghazal. The instrumentalist on the sarang was jarring to say the least. The import of the lovely lines got lost and mired in a series of bhols (swaras) and showmanship. At times, it seems worthy if a musician, no matter how popular and adept he be, can just recreate the magic of songs like the ghazals, as they were rendered by great masters of yore. Creativity that enriches the emotion is welcome but technical innovation at the cost of emotive deprivation is rather a sad state of affairs.The three-day dance and music festival conducted at Ravindra Bharati was a part of the annual &#8216;Parampara series&#8217; brought out by Kuchipudi dance duo Raja and Radha Reddy.
