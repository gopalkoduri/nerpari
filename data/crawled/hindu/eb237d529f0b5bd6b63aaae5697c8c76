VB.R.C. IYENGARThe vocal concert of Trivandrum S. Jayasri was an index of the talent available in Carnatic music. In her 150-minute performance, Jayasri showcased her talent with a rich voice and perfectsruti gnanam. The concert kept the audience absorbed. Application to develop the depth of the voice atadhara shadjawill certainly add to the merit of the artiste.She has great names behind her training but changing gurus frequently may corrupt the maintenance of a chastebani. As is well known,baniis a crucial factor in the chastity of art. Noticeably, the programme organised by Kalasagaram was rather packed in including too many items of considerable weight with much remaining unfulfilled. Jayasri can render the songs neatly but hermanodharma sangithaneeds design, planning and proper insight. Same is the case with respect toneravalandswarakalpana. This failure is seen in almost every contemporary artiste. The concert commenced with the popularvarnamintodi; the usage of the notepanchamamin thechittaswarain the item was an all too common error.Sri mahaganapathiminataana,Ne chesinainpurnachandrika,durmagacharainranjanikept the audience engaged. The presentation of the great itemmuruga muruga, a composition of Periyasami Tooran insaverigot a raw deal. An item that can be covenanted for as long as an hour slipped unnoticed.Hiranmayiof Diksithar inlalithawas attractive with pleasingkalapramanam. Jayasri's attempt in rendering the RTP- in the present case in theraga, kalyani- was rather juvenile and immature. Singingthanamneeds great skill, right guidance and listening to great masters. In the day's concert, it took a beating.Ramesh Pai on the violin has made phenomenal progress in recent years and his contribution and support to the concert was commendable. Ramanamurthy on the mridangam needs greater involvement.Bottom Template Starts
