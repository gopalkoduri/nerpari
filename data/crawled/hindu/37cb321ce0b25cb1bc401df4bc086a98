VOothukkadu Venkatasubbaiyer's compositions fascinate the untrained music lover as well as the scholarly connoisseur. In fact, the simple, endearing conversational Tamil in &#8216;Vishamakkaara Kannan' scores over the chaste Sanskrit and the delightful imagery in &#8216;Swagatham Krishna' or &#8216;Neerada Sama Neela Krishna.' Oothukkadu Venkatasubbaiyer's prolific repertoire includes various musical forms such as kritis, tillanas, slokas, kavadi chindus and javalis. He has handled hundreds of ragas and composed in well known as well as rare talas. He has sung on several deities though Krishna has remained his all time favourite.The department of music, Avinashilingam University for Women, Coimbatore, under the leadership of Janaka Maya Devi, head, music department, organised a national workshop on the compositions of Oothukkadu Venkatasubbaiyer at Thiruchitrambalam Auditorium, recently.T.K. Shanmuganandam, chancellor, Avinashilingam University for Women, presided over the inaugural function while Saroja Prabhakaran, vice chancellor of the University inaugurated the workshop.Meena Subramaniam, &#8216;A' grade artist and disciple of M.L. Vasanthakumari, taught a few of Venkatakavi's compositions to the participants. She was assisted by Lalitha, a budding musician and an alumnus of Avinashilingam University.Traditional trainingThe workshop began with &#8216;Pranavaakaaram,' a composition on Lord Ganesha in Arabhi. The songs were taught in the traditional way starting with the arohanam and avarohanam of the ragas. Many of the songs taught were well-known. They included &#8216;Kuzhaloodhi Manamellaam' (Khambhodi), &#8216;Pullai Piravi Thara Venum (Chenjurutti), &#8216;Eppadiththaan En Ullam Pugunthu' in Neelambari and &#8216;Aadaathu Asangaathu' in Madhyamavati, besides a few compositions in Sanskrit. &#8216;Vaanchayasi Edi Kusalam' in Kalyani, from Kamakshi navavarnam was however, new to most of the participants.They enjoyed learning &#8216;Kannan Varuginra Neram,' the lilting kavadi chindu and the thillana in Surutti. One could not help feeling that a few more rare compositions should have been included instead of the usual and well-known songs.The response for the workshop was overwhelming. Besides the local participants, students and teachers of music from various places such as Puducherry, Thoothukkudi, Madurai and Chidambaram benefited from the workshop.
