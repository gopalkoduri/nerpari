College of Music, Madurai, his  concert, strictly adhering to tradition, was a guideline to the students.His melodious and powerful voice, crystal-clear padanthara and  rendition, created a transcendental mood. He is a link in  the Semmangudi school, as his father, Narayana Iyer, who initiated him into music, is a disciple of the legend.Sarma flagged off the concert with a rare Adi tala varnam in Nalinakanthi, composed by Lalgudi Jayaraman.A brief and exquisite alapana of Reetigowla was followed by a Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Chera ravathemira, Ramayya,&#8217; set to Adi tala, which was laced with brilliant swarakalpana.Next came the brisk and lilting &#8216;Palukuche,&#8217;  a rare composition of Pattanam Subrahmania Iyer&#8217; in Phalamanjari (a janya of Kharaharapriya), set to Ropaka tala. The elaboration of the demanding gamakapradhana raga Varali was illustrative of ragavardhini in three stages &#8211; Mathra, Madhya and Thara sthayis.&#8216;Kamakshi Bangaru&#8217; of Syama Sastri, set to misrachappu, had niraval and creative manodharmaswara at the lyrical sequence &#8216;Sivasankari, Sukasyamale.&#8217;  As usual, Sarma selected an enlivening Ekaraga kriti of Tyagaraja &#8216;Chinna natena chei&#8217; in Kalavathi, set to Adi tala.The major raga Bhairavi was delineated with ragabhava, showcasing his command over classicism. The beauty of &#8216;visranthi&#8217; (repose) was evident in his sublime alapana.&#8216;Ika nannubrova,&#8217; a composition of Pallavi Seshayyar, set to Adi tala (two kala), captured the elegance of chowkakala. Impressive kalpanaswara with flawless passages in two speeds enhanced the musicality of the song.A brief sketch of Behag  was mellifluous.  Swati Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Bhaja bhaja manasa&#8217; in Sindubhairavi was also sung by the vocalist.Sarma concluded his concert with the opening sloka of Adisankara&#8217;s Soundaryalahari &#8216;Sivashsakthyayuktho&#8217; in Madhyamavathi.Nedumangad Sindhu on the violin and Kallekulangara Unnikrishnan on the mridangam provided able support throughout the concert.Latha Varma, reader, S.S.V.

Sunil, both from Swati Tirunal College of Music, Thiruvananthapuram, gave lecture-demonstrations on &#8216;Various aspects of laya in Carnatic music&#8217; and  on &#8216;Grahabhedam&#8217; respectively. A lecture demonstration on &#8216;Ragam-Thanam-Pallavi&#8217; by Ranganathasarma was informative .
