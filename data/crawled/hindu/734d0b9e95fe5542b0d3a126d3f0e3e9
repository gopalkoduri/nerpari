VHARISH BALA violin duet by Akkarai sisters, Subbulakshmi and Swarnalatha, stood out for its synchronisation and emotive richness. The majestic navaraga varnam by Pattanam Subramania Iyer was the first number of the concert. The second speed in the charnam was charming on account of the dexterity and skill exhibited by the violinists.A short essay of Hamsadhwani was tagged on to the Dikshithar kriti &#8216;Vathapi ganapathim.&#8217; Exhilarating swara passages in &#8216;sarvalaghu&#8217; pattern were executed at a brisk pace with eduppu on &#8216;Veetharaginam vinuthayoginam.&#8217;The sisters &#8216;bowed&#8217; their way into the audience&#8217;s heart with &#8216;Sobillu Saptaswara&#8217; in Jaganmohini raga in a madhyamakala rendition. The chittaswara with its glides and turns still retained the melodic content in the raga.The artistes played the Tyagaraja pancharatna kriti in Arabhi &#8216;Sadinchane o manasa&#8217; but  it was a bit too brisk for the listeners.  In the raga delineation, Subbulakshmi went for a round-up of the raga structure, before proceeding to a step-by-step approach. Playing in two octaves for the striking lines heightened the effect of the composition.H. Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatom seemed to know every twirl of the sangatis and he kept pace with the violinists without a single slip. Nellai Balaji on the mridangam complemented the camaraderie and stood out for his vidwat in laya during the thani avarthanam.&#8216;Alaipayuthe kanna,&#8217; the Oothukkad composition in Kanada raga, &#8216;Kurai Onrum Illai,&#8217; ragamalika and a Swati Tirunal bhajan &#8216;Vishweshwar darsan kar&#8217; were the concluding items.Tharangam Samskarika Vedi, a cultural organisation of bank employees, had organised the programme.Bottom Template Starts
