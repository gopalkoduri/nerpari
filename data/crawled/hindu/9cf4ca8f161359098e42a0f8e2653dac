VEach style of music normally gets confined to a particular taste group in the matter of appreciation. Madurai T. N. Seshagopalan&#8217;s brand is to dismantle sangita to submit to his vocal twists and turns with least care bestowed on raga rasa or kirtana sentiment. These two vital ingredients of good music, the rasikas could visualise themselves because he sang familiar Tyagaraja songs on the beauties of which the listeners were quite well educated by vidwans of an earlier era.Manodharma and expression were elbowing each other in alapanas in his kutcheri for Sadjam. While still adhering to sastra, he revealed a predilection for musical effervescence. Such was his delineation of Bindumalini (&#8216;Enta Muddo Enta Sogaso&#8217;). His subjective vision was more towards sanchara jugglery than clarity of the raga&#8217;s identifiable shape. Hearing through the unfolding of the development the experience was puzzling. The compact structure of this and the other kirtanas he sang, was not an essential part of his musical equipment. By the reputation he has gained he has the freedom to sing the way he thinks is high-class exposition. His was vidwat harnessed to venturesome demonstrativeness.There were ostentatious flashes in his Mukhari (&#8216;Ksheenamai&#8217;) vinyasa. Exhibitionistic tenderness was in full flow to smother the raga&#8217;s flavour. There was expansiveness. But one welcome aspect in the kutcheri as a whole was the decibel-restraint Seshagopalan observed. Overlapping exotic  sancharas  competed for attention. In this vocal manipulation was predominant. Clusters of such phrasings dotted the Mukhari alapana environment. The bhava of the kirtana was scanty by the way he over-stretched and punched the sahityas (&#8216;Girvana Nataka Alankara&#8217;). Earlier Seshagopalan presented Devamanohari alapana and the song &#8216;Evarikai Avataaramu.&#8217;The violinist was S.Varadarajan.  Quite sharp in absorbing Seshagopalan&#8217;s presentation technique, in his solo versions, he sanitised the ragas, Devamanohari, Bindumalini and Mukhari. There was tenderness, directness and depth in the arrangement of sancharas. He was a shining example of a mature accompanist.The percussion artists R. Ramesh (mridangam) and B.S. Purushottaman (kanjira) were enthusiastic in responding with display of relevant laya korvais.
