VSVK"Endaro Mahaanubhaavulu" is a musical Taj and T.N. Krishnan in his solo violin concert for Carnatica with his daughter Viji Krishnan Natarajan gave a moonlight view of the great Pancharathna. Performances of past veterans dissolve in memory and fragments of greatness linger like a song heard long ago or a grand alapana. Krishnan's concert served to stir memory through the kirtana "Entaraanithana" (Harikhambodi) "Janani  -   Ninnuvina" (Ritigowla) " Sri Subramanyaya Namaste" (Khambodi)Krishnan stands for elevating sangita with aesthetic polish. Layers is of acquired tradition through accompanying stalwarts have inspired performing excellence. His visionary motivation peaked when he lost himself in the manthara stayi sancharas in Khambodi vinyasa.Crucial roleSilences and pauses played a crucial role in the structure of the alapanas of Harikhambodi and Ritigowla. The supremacy of exquisite manodharma scored over the mechanical, conventional alapana development. It was a reflective relationship between Carnatic music, art and subtlety  -   rich sanchara expression. Raga delineation and rendering of songs were an epitome of all that is good and true in venerated sampradaya. If in the experience of music's beauty lies the secret of its appeal for the rasikas Krishnan's recital provided it in a good measure. The concert as a whole was a journey to take music to its roots.Mannargudi Easwaran's mridangam accompaniment was laya culture in refinement. In his tani there was the right gift of ready and felicitous percussive patterns. It was interesting to observe how he transformed his technical competence into changing nadais to reveal growing images of laya facets. Vaikom Gopalakrishnan on the ghatam answered Easwaran's statements with vigour.Bottom Template Starts
