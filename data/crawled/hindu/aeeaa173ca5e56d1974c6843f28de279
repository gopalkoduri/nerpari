VKalakkadu R. Seethalakshmi presented a bouquet of Swati Tirunal kritis in her thematic vocal concert for the Thiagaraja Sangeetha Vidwath Samajam. The artist adopted a simple, uncomplicated approach to manodharma elements, placing few demands on the listener.Alapanas included compact raga sketches of Arabhi, Ramapriya and Kanada, touching upon essential features, without dwelling on possibilities for elaboration. In &#8216;Narasimha Maamava Bhagawan&#8217; (Arabhi), chittaswaram added a festive air to the kriti, taken forward by sarvalaghu swaras. A brief tryst with alapana in Ramapriya raga yielded dhaivata-centric sancharas followed by the composition &#8216;Saamodam.&#8217; A sprightly filler in Vasantha &#8216;Parama Purusha,&#8217; accompanied by kalpanaswaras with kuraippu, made an apt entry at this juncture.Aiming for a deliberate emphasis on swarakshara, the well-known composition &#8216;Maamava Sada Janani&#8217; (Kanada) had the opening syllable of &#8216;Maamava&#8217; poised at the madhyama in a departure from the customary eduppu at the rishabha.In a generous gesture, the delineation of the main raga Kalyani, was left to the vocalist&#8217;s disciple whose earnest fledgling attempt was infused with confidence. &#8216;Saarasa Suvadana&#8217; was the kriti elaborated. Other items included &#8216;Paripaahi Ganaadhipa&#8217; (Saveri) and &#8216;Paripaalayamaam&#8217; (Ritigowla).The artist was inconvenienced by a sound system that screeched jarringly at random intervals. Despite the vocalist&#8217;s forceful articulation of sahitya, the recalcitrant mike dispersed sound, fogging clarity of lyric.Akkarai Swarnalatha (violin) presented an appreciable portrait of Ramapriya with due emphasis on gamaka. This young artist&#8217;s dedicated stint as accompanist and soloist is now yielding dividends in terms of fluency and assuredness, as the mature phrasing in Kanada revealed. K. Parthasarathy (mridangam) maintained tempo with the right balance of exuberance and restraint.
