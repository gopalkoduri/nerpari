VKalabharati witnessed a wizardly show of whistling of classical music that comprised a select set of compositions in different ragas paired with film songs set to music in the same scales, one after the other successively. The artiste who accomplishe\u000ad the rare feat was K. Sivaprasad of Hyderabad on whom titles like Galamurali and Andhra Koyila were already conferred by cultural bodies of high standing.The process of whistling of any tune in conformity with the set pitch in perfect rhythm even for few minutes continuously is not an easy task. It needs no elaboration to elucidate how much arduous it would be to blow breath with controlled variation in intensity into an articulately changing gaps between the teeth and thence the lips to evolve music. It demands to be categorised as a feat which was accomplished nonchalantly by Sivaprasad proving himself a phenom.Irrespective of the constraint imposed by himself in selecting classical compositions for the obvious reason of finding a film song in the same ragas which they symbolise, it turned out to be an awe-inspiring session of over two hours.Getting off to a scintillating start withVatapiganapathimadorned with swaram executed with the same tenor, he rendered the film songSriraghuram Jayaraghuramimmediately. Then he similarly renderedSriragapancharatna kritiandJo lali(film song),Samajavaragamana(Hindolam) andPagalevennela,Vasudevayani(Kalyani) andSaavirahe Tavadeena,OkaparikokapariandCheriyasodakuof Annamayya set to music in Kharaharapriya and Mohana respectively, each followed byBalanuraa MadanaaandChandanacharchithaand so on totalling more than two tens of sets of classical compositions and film songs.He was ably accompanied on violin by M.S. Sarma and S.V.R. Murty; mridangam by D.S.R Murty, keyboards by V.S. Ramaiah and Kannaraju, ghatam by Hanumantharao and local artiste Dhananjay on tabla.
