VThe management committees of Sree Sankara Matham (of Kanchi Kamakoti Maha Samsthan) led by its secretary Susarla Suryanarayana Murty along with D. Bhaskara Murty, secretary of the 64 -year -old Sri Vijaya Thyagaraja Sangeetha Sabha, organised a four-day fete of music followed by Thyagaraja Aaradhana at the premises of Sankara Matham from last Wednesday. Renowned vocalist Manda Sudharani who got approved as an &#8216;A' grade artiste of Akashvani recently, was felicitated and the presidents of the associations Sriman Lanka Jagannadham (Sankara Matham) and Ramachandran (Sangeetha Sabha) conferred the sabha's title Sangeetha Sudhanidhi on her. Later, in the company of her guru Ivaturi Vijayeswara Rao on violin and M. Sridhar on mridangam, she evocatively rendered a scholarly recital. Eruditely structured and rendered Ragam Tanam and Pallavi was the highlight.The other concerts which similarly stood out were the vocal recitals scintillatingly rendered by Akundi Srinivasa Raja Rao of Kakinada on Friday and of Dwaram Tyagaraju with which the fete grandly concluded on an elated note last Sunday. Akundi, ably accompanied on violin by M. Satyanarayana Sarma, G. Venkata Rao on mridangam and M.S. Prasada Rao on ghatam, tunefully and evocatively elaborated Edutai (Sama) and Saaketha Rama (Poorvikalyani) adorned with alapanas and swaram in the two tempos. Inthasoukhyama (Kapi) expatiated with alapana, neravu and swaram stood out as the piece-de-resistance of the entire fete.After a traditionally offered puja to Sri Thyagaraja, Ooregimpu and Pancharatnakrithi sevas were offered by about 100 artistes. Then followed 10, 15 and 30 minute recitals of the compositions of the composer by local artistes. The recital by Dwaram Thyagaraju concluded the fest. Invigoratively elaborated versions of Yevarura (Mohana), Sambho Mahadeva (Pantuvarali) and Chakkani rajamargamu (Kharaharapriya) were the highlights of his recital. He was knowledgeably supported by the Pappu brothers, Jnanadev on violin and Jayadev on mridangam.
