VAs one of the oldest rasikas in Carnatic music circles, I have enjoyed the privilege of listening to live performances of many of the greatest Carnatic musicians, for several decades.Some of those events which took place 40 or 50 years ago are still fresh in my memory, as they're likely to be in the minds of many other music lovers; and T .V. Gopalakrishnan's recent vocal recital belonged to that class of concerts.One of the important factors which made the performance memorable was the superb accompaniment provided by veteran violinist V.V. Subramaniam and mridangam vidwan Guruvayoor Dorai. The violin sounded like a perfect echo of the singer's earnest voice, and yet had an enchanting character of its own; and the sound of the mridangam was as soft as it was sparkling.Reciprocally, a vital factor which enabled VVS and Dorai to raise their own level of achievement was TVG's well-known passion for encouraging his accompanists and creating endless opportunities for them to excel.True vidwatIn the inspiring company of these old masters, the relatively younger ghatam vidwan Tripunithura Radhakrishnan also found himself in great form. And a true source of inspiration for all the musicians was a large and highly responsive audience in the compact concert hall.TVG's forceful response to such a favourable ambience was to give one of the best performances of his long and distinguished career, as he rendered several successive numbers with increasing weight and profundity. A colourful rendering of Patnam Subramania Iyer's composition, &#8216;Rama Ika Nannu Brovaraada,' was followed by the projection of a couple of Dikshitar kritis on an extremely large and wide screen.In the song &#8216;Sivakameswareem' in Kalyani, TVG anchored the niraval and swara improvisations on the briskly-rendered line, &#8216;Chidambara Pureeswareem,' which gave us a glimpse of Kalyani from an unusual angle. And the tour de force of the concert was the song &#8216;Sri Subrahmanyaaya Namaste' in Khambodi, which was rendered in a monumental style reminiscent of M.D. Ramanathan, the master of meditation.
