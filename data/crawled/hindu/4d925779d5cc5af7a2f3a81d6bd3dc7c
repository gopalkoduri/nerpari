VHis oil and acrylic works have been exhibited in America, Europe, Africa, Saudi Arabia and Canada. His paintings have a harmonic synergy of colour, texture and figures, but surprisingly he has not attended any art school to learn the basics. His art tends to be transcendental, it transcends thought and emotions. His work also reflects the joy and sorrow and the celebrations and tragedies of life.The exhibition will run till 25th October (except on 21st October) at the Lalit Kala Akademi. It will then move to Dhoomimal&#8217;s City Gallery for three days.
