VThe Senior Citizens Complex of Vanaprastha in association with Shankara Seva Sadhanam at Vadavalli, Coimbatore, celebrated Navaratri festival with religious and devotional fervour at Bhuvaneswari Hall from September 19 to 27.While the morning sessions were devoted to recitation of sacred hymns  in praise of Goddess Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati, the evening sessions featured devotional songs  by Sarada Sivanandam, Devaki Lakshmikanthan, Selvakumari (with her disciples), Geeta Narayanan, Sruthi Balasubramanian, Anesh and Ajeish including a glistening veena recital by Vijaya Rajaraman.Ramachandran&#8217;s vocal recital under the aegis of Nada Brahma Gana Sabha, a wing of Vanaprastha, was marked by grittiness. The  power and range of the artist&#8217;s voice were  not put to good use in the kutcheri. His sedate opening of a varnam in Ravichandrika was followed by &#8216;Gajaananayutham&#8217; (Chakravaham) with swaras.Ramachandran&#8217;s presentation of &#8216;Dharmavardhini Paalini Saraswathi&#8217; (Dharamavati), &#8216;Jagadananda Kaaraka&#8217; (Nattai) and &#8216;Sree Varalakshmi Namasthubhyam&#8217; were lacking in gana-naya. Even &#8216;Budhamasrayamyaham&#8217; could not elevate the quality of the concert. The Bhairavi swara jathi was more demonstrative than lyrical. Sruti was at a discount at several places in the niraval for the kriti, &#8216;Parvathinayakane Charanam.&#8217;Manu Narayanan was the violin accompanist. Radhakrishnan (mridangam) and Kuppuraj (ganjira) made their presence felt in thani avarthanam.
