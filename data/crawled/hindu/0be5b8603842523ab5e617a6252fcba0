VS teeped in classicism, Suguna Varadachari's vocal recital at the seventh anniversary celebrations of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore, was marked by dignity and grace sans frills and gimmicks throughout. Her interpretation of the ragas and songs were transmuted with a touch of musical idealism engendering sukhanubhava to the listeners. Suguna's curtain raiser was the Chalanata varnam, &#8216;Samukhmu' (Thanjavur Quartet) presented with a cascade of swaras.&#8216;Syamasundaranga' in Dhanyasi that followed was rendered with a facile voice in madhyamakala pace. Her Sahana alapana for the kriti, &#8216;Dehi Thava Paadabhaktim' will linger in the minds of aficionados for a long time. &#8216;Neekendukudayaraadu' in Simhendramadhyamam was neat. Her Khambodi alapana was built around sensitive and perceptive sancharas carrying enough telling musical phrases. Papanasam Sivan's composition, &#8216;Sree Gowrimanohara' (Gowrimanohari) was presented with &#233;lan.Pleasant SaveriThe crowning piece of the kutcheri was the RTP in Saveri, chatusra jampai, misra nadai, &#8216;Neranammiti, Nee Pada Sarojamu' and the raga sancharas in Mohanam, Mukhari, Bowli, Saraswathi and Sivaranjani were pleasing to the ears.Padma Shankar's (violin) nalinam in her deft bowing struck a rapport with the artist's interpretation of the ragas and swaras. Her polished and nuanced repartees to the vocalist's imaginative flights were aesthetically pleasing. Balaji's energetic and rhythmic beats on the mridangam vibrated with refinement in the percussive wing. His sprightly melkala sollus enhanced the thani appeal.Earlier at the commencement of the anniversary celebrations addressed by M. Krishnan of Krishna Sweets, Suguna Varadachari was conferred the &#8216;Isai Manimakutam' title to which she replied suitably. T. Satheesh Kumar, founder, Rajalakshmi Fine Arts and R. Kousalya offered felicitations to the vocalist.
