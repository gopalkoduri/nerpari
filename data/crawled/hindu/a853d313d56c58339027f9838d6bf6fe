VKanyakumari A. gave her violin recital as part of the Eighth Cross Ganesha Festival music concerts in Mysore recently. Embar S. Kannan (supporting violin), Arjun Kumar (mridanga) and T.A. Ramanuja (morsing) accompanied the veteran artiste who has served the art form for more than four decades.Her technique of bowing and fingering undoubtedly vouch for the clarity in the notes elicited and the delineations she defined while expatiating the presentations. Nevertheless, the above accomplishments remained on superficial planes relating more to the technical aspects than anything to do in furtherance of creating any noticeable relish (rasa), which was indispensable in fostering and strengthening the concert in general and compositions in particular. In this respect, the present concert was not elevating.She could have selected a few ragas for elaborate interpretations for a convincing satiation. Even, Chalanata (&#8220;Induko&#8221; &#8211; Kotishwara Iyer), which she elaborated to a moderate length, thrived mainly because of its own inherent grandeur, without being infused with any remarkable emotive movements.&#8220;Bhaavayami&#8221; (Ramayana Saptaragamalika - Swathy Tirunal) with introductory alapanas for all the ragas seemed to be an unnecessary prolongation. The singer started alapana and the tanas toggled between Revathi and Mohana, followed by a long melody chain in 47 ragas to mark the 47th year celebrations of the Trust.With this, the nature of the proceedings presented an arid-chequered scenario, running short of any definite focus.G.K. Manamohan sang under the auspices of Nadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha, accompanied by Aditi Krishna Prasad (violin), Radhesh (mridanga) and Manjunath (ghata).The young prospective artiste is endowed with a pleasing voice, which is in a sense made up for what may be proudly termed as the traditional style of singing.Consistency in tonal qualities has rendered that voice especially suited for expressions unmindful of the pitches it traversed &#8211; the gamut ranging from themandra sthaayitotaara sthaayipanchamas with remarkable ease.Sadhana has facilitated his capabilities to take any perceptible form to meet the musical requirements.Pre-dominance of technical fervours overpowering the imports of the compositions and the moods of the ragas weakened those merits.Take for example, Bidaram Krishnappa&#8217;s &#8220;Amba Brovave&#8221; (Dharmavathi), which reasonably demanded utmost involvement and softness amounting to total submission. Crisp and smooth graces enriched the alapana, but the kalpanaswaras were rhythmic than melodic.The method in which he framed the kalpanaswaras for &#8220;Nidayarada&#8221; (Vasantha Bhairavi - Tyagaraja) should have carried better relevance to the supplicating tone of the text. The lyrical sections were more cursory, without being sufficiently supported by suitable impressive vocal inflections. Similar patterns in sancharas, rapid shifts from one pitch to another and complicated manoeuvrings in developing the ragas undermined the general approach.&#8220;Shri Vasudeva&#8221; (Raamapriya &#8211; Vasudevacharya - with a neraval at &#8220;Navanitha Dadhichora&#8221;), &#8220;Valli Manoharane&#8221; (Shanmukhapriya - Bellary Sheshagiri Achar), and Raga-Thana Pallavi (in Madhyamavathi followed by swaraprastara in Ragamalika) were other interesting and scholarly renditions.
