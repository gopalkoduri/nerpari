VKudamaloor Janardanan started the concert with the evergreen &#8216;Alai Payudhe&#8217; in Kanada. The portion &#8216;Kanintha un venu ganam kattil varukithe&#8217; was like a  breeze,  liftingrasikasto sublime heights.The next item was a brief presentation of Kalyani. Kudamaloor  opened with a swara pallavi set to misrachappu talam. It was continued with a ragamalika comprising Valachi, Sahana and Hindolam. The piece concluded with a thaniavarthanam with masterful strokes by Vypeen Satheesh on the mridangam, Hari Krishnamoorthy on the tabla and Kottayam Unnikrishnan on the ghatam.Then came &#8216;Chaliye Kunjanamo,&#8217; a Swati Tirunal composition in Vrindavan Saranga.   The flautist presented it in detail with an alaap at the outset.The last piece of the first half was the familiar &#8216;Rara venu gopabala&#8217; in Bilahari. It was enchanting with the notes of the flute blending with the rhythm of the tabla and ghatam. Brisk playing of the swaras on the flute was breathtaking.The stage was reset for the second half of the concert with a keyboardist, violinist, rhythm composer, and tabla player.Kudamaloor  began with &#8216;Aayiram Padasarangal&#8217; from the film &#8216;Nadhi.&#8217; This was picked up by Hari Krishnamoorthy on the tabla, Joy on the rhythm composer and Kudamaloor&#8217;s disciple Sivakumar on the violin. The background score was provided by Arun on the keyboard.This was followed by a violin solo by Sivakumar.The signature tune for Akashvani was played by Kudamaloor, followed by a collection of golden numbers  based on ragas like Sivarenjini, Begada, Anandabhairavi, Charukesi, Sindubhairavi and Kalyani.Kudamaloor Janardanan wound up his flute recital with the Hindustan raag Piloo (Kapi in Carnatic music).The songs were &#8216;Kadhal Rojave&#8217; from &#8216;Roja,&#8217; followed by &#8216;Chinna chinna asai,&#8217; &#8216;Yedukula rathi devanevide,&#8217; &#8216;Pandu paadiya pattilorennum,&#8217; &#8216;Mouna sarovaram,&#8217; &#8216;Cheppu kilukana changathi&#8217; and &#8216;Kuttanadan punjayile.&#8217;The concert was organised as part of the philately exhibition KERAPEX 2007, at Kanakakunnu Palace grounds, Thiruvananthapuram.
