VEndowed with a gutsy voice, the violinist-turned vocalist Amritha Murali framed her performance, featured by Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore, to give a good account of her musical expression imparting aesthetic finesse to the numbers handled.Her nipping start of &#8216;Karunimpa' in Sahana followed by &#8216;Sobillu' (Jaganmohini) was marked by intensity of feeling and lucidity of sahitya. Her vision of Varali for the kriti &#8216;Maragathamani' and Sankarabharanam for the kriti &#8216;Sadasivam Upasmahe' in a gracious voice coupled with musical serenity and sensitive sentiments revealed her vidwat and manodharma. However, her voice was not cooperative in the upper reaches in the niraval portion of the kriti.Sensitive sancharasThe main piece of the raga, Kaanada, for the RTP abounded with sensitive sancharas scrupulously executed with several layers of the raga's perspective. &#8216;Nekkurugi' (Abhogi), &#8216;Ramanaitharuvai' (Sindhubhairavi) and &#8216;Vazhimarai' (Nattakkurinji) added sheen to the kutcheri. Anantapadmanabha's solo versions of the ragas lingered on their elegance and grace. Sivakumar's (mridangam) thani was well-balanced with multiple segments of soft rhythmic layers in his percussive beats.
