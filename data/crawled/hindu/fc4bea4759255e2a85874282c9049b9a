VMusic knows no language, no region, no religion. Latif Bolat, a Turkish musician, proved that to a packed Town Hall at Kozhikode with his truly memorable Sufi recital, organised by Navatharangam, a cultural forum of bank employees.The Turkish language in which he sang may have been Greek to everyone except him inside the venue but the power of his voice  was such that all those who were assembled there were mesmerised and transported to another place (the audio visual presentation on the LCD screen also helped). There is a haunting quality to Bolat&#8217;s voice; one wondered how he would have sounded in a venue with better acoustics than the Town Hall.Not a soul stirred during the couple of hours Bolat, who is also a scholar of Turkish culture and author, performed; after the show, there was a rush at the backstage to congratulate him and to ask him more about his music.In his show he wasn&#8217;t just singing; he was giving himself excellent instrumental accompaniment on &#8216;baglama,&#8217; a long-necked lute. Listening to it was  a pleasure. Bolat&#8217;s singing was in perfect &#8216;sruthi&#8217; with his &#8216;baglama&#8217; right through; that was one of the reasons why the show was so melodious.Bolat, who performed in Mumbai, Kolkata, and neighbouring Nilambur before coming to Kozhikode, is not just a talented musician; he is a fine speaker too. He  explained the meaningof the songs he would be presenting in excellent English. He also narrated the history behind the songs.Many of the songs he sung had meaningful lyrics. Among the songs he presented at Kozhikode was a celebrated 15th century poem, &#8216;What of it,&#8217; by Nesimi.Bolat also brought to life modern works like &#8216;Hiroshima,&#8217; a poignant poem written by Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet.It is in the form of a monologue by a seven-year-old girl, one of the victims of the bombing, speaking to the world after her death.
