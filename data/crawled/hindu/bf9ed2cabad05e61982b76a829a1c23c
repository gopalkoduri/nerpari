VA popular exponent of Carnatic music, Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam, niece of Balachander and worthy disciple of S. Rajam, a guru with uncompromising adherence to traditional values, has recorded the songs in two audio volumes. The creations of Syama Sastri included are &#8216;Pahimam Sri Rajeswari&#8217; (Nata) &#8216;Purahara Jaaye&#8217; (Gowlipantu), &#8216;Rave Pawataraja Kumari&#8217; (Kalyani), &#8216;Brovavamma&#8217; (Nilambavi), &#8216;Brihannayaki&#8217; (Madhyamavali) and &#8216;Brova Samayamidhe&#8217; (Punnagavarali).The rare Tyagaraja songs such as &#8216;Leela Gana Jooche&#8217; in Dundubhi, &#8216;Sitapati Kavavayya&#8217; in Sankarabharanam, &#8216;Nityaroopa&#8217; in Kapi (which also has  a Durbar attire) sung by musicians belonging to different sishya paramparas of Tyagaraja, are some that find place in the programme. Hamirkalyani is an eternal charmer and the detailed dissertation of the raga with many Hindustani prayogas is a splendid display of performing abilities packed with confidence. &#8216;Parimala Ranganatham&#8217; in which Dikshitar pays his obeisance to Lord Parimala Ranganatha, the Divine Spouse of Devi Pundarikavalli, and the Punnagavarali gem &#8216;Brovasamayamidhe&#8217; by Shyama Sastri, gently guide the rasika to a cadence of contemplation and spirituality.The Kannada piece, &#8216;Palayamam,&#8217; with a lively chittaswaram, &#8216;Purachara Jaaye&#8217; that reflects all the subtle microtones of Gowlipantu, and &#8216;Rave Parvatha Raja Kumari,&#8217; a weighty composition in Kalyani by Syama Sastri, &#8216;Sri Vaidyanatham&#8217; in Atana, the lilting &#8216;Brovavamma&#8217; in Nilambari and &#8216;Hasthi Vadanaya&#8217; in Navaroj are some of the radiant nuggets that add a rich glow to this handsome effort of the musician.An inlay card giving details of the programme and accompanying artistes would have been appropriate.
