VSundara GanamruthamGeetha Rajasekhar - Carnatic classicalApoorva Audios A-1, ACDThanjavur Sankara Iyer's contribution to Carnatic music is perhaps not as much sung as it deserves to be. A prolific composer of high calibre, a well recognised guru, a commendable performer who despite ill health has the mental strength to give a full-fledged concert, Sankara Iyer is an artiste who has earned appreciation and respect from the entire musical fraternity, the public and the media.Ten of his compositions have been sung by Geetha Rajasekhar in an audio CD released by Apoorva Audios.  "Sakti Ganapatiye," in Gowlai, with swaras topped by a familiar korvai, is  a compact version. A brief essay of Hamsanadham is a pleasant prelude to "Ezhiludai" in Adi talam with a brisk imaginatively conceptualised chittaswaram.A neat alapana of Hindolam and "Maal Maruga Shanmukha" with sangatis apposite to the mood of the lyrics bond well with the musical sensibilities of the rasika.  "Nathajanapalini" in Nalinakanti has become a favourite with contemporary performing artistes. The Sanskrit sahitya extolling Devi is absolutely lyrical and Geetha impresses with her fluent interpretation. The swara improvisations could have done with a bit more focus on the raga lakshana. "Ranganayakiye'' in Nayaki has all the beauty and regal bearing of Dikshitar's "Ranganayakam."Sensitive prayogasPoorvikalyani is elaborated by the vocalist and violinist M. A. Krishnaswami with sensitive, aesthetic prayogas. The tani avartanam by Delhi Sairam on the mridangam, H. Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam and A.S. Krishnan on the morsing is a well-conceived exercise.The Ranjani Mala comprising ragas Ranjani, Sriranjani, Megaranjani and Janaranjani is enjoyable  -   yet the anuswaras for Megaranjani and Janaranjani could have been handled with more care.S.
