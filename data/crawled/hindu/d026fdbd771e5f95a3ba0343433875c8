VKutcheriSanjay Subramanyam Charsur Digital  CD 1981 Prize Rs. 375 (two CDs)Excerpts from the live concert under the aegis of Kalakshetra in 2001 have been released by Charsur Digital. The programme beginning with Pallavi Gopala Iyer's Kalyani varnam in Ata tala with frills galore moves on to one of the Panchalinga Kshetra kritis of Dikshitar, `Ananda Natana Prakasam,' embellished with neraval and swaras that are not too frequently sung for this composition.The Useni raga elaboration is a delightful exercise with all the pertinent prayogas emerging with melody and total classicism.The genius of a tune smith, Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar, has given a superb attire to Arunachala Kavi's `Eppadi Manam Thunindhadho,' and Sanjay's version has a wealth of involved expression, `Nagai Muralidharan,' an experienced campaigner on the violin, presents a rich fabric of Useni with many shades of highlighting the rakti of the raga.The expansion of Bilahari with subtle touches of the Maharajapuram style is pleasing, while the kriti, `Sri Chamundeswari' of Mysore Vasudevachar with its chittaswaram, somehow reminds one of M. D. Ramanathan.Tiruchi Sankaran, a mridangist of high repute and the much mourned ace kanjira player, the late Harishankar play an excellent tani avartanam.S. P.Bottom Template Starts
