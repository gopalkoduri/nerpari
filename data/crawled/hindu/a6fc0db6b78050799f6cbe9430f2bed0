VThe verses  in simple, graceful Malayalam gleamed with worldly wisdom. For the singer Sankaran Nampoothiri, who has sung in movies such as &#8216;Madhuchandralekha,&#8217; &#8216;Vadakkumnnadhan,&#8217; &#8216;Kanakasimhasanam,&#8217; &#8216;Suryan&#\u000a8217; and &#8216;Naivedyam,&#8217; it was a unique experience, for it was his debut concert  of Malayalam compositions only.The audience too appreciated the songs as it touched their hearts.  In classical concerts, musicians usually render the compositions of Tyagaraja, Dikshitar, Syama Sastri, Swati Tirunal and many others that are penned in either Telugu or Sanskrit. But Kerala Sangeetha Kutcheri  at Theerthapadamandapam was a different experience. As the name implied, the  concert focussed on Malayalam compositions authored by poet laureates like Irayimmen Thampi, Swati Tirunal, Kuttikunju Thankachi, K. C. Kesava Pillai and Kuttamathu Kunji Krishna Kurup.Mostly devotional, these songs  were usually rendered during temple ceremonies. As they were in Malayalam, the devotees were able to grasp the meaning of  the lyrics and enjoy the songs to the fullest. However, such compositions except for a few Swati padams and Thampi&#8217;s &#8216;Karuna cheyvaan enthu thaamasam Krishna,&#8217; have yet to become popular as they are rarely performed at concerts.It is in a bid to popularise such scores that Drisyavedi and Wisconsin University have been conducting Kerala Sangeetha Kutcheris for the last 16 years as part of their annual Keralolsavam festival.Sankaran Nampothiri chose compositions of Unnayi Warrier, Irayimmen Thampi, Unnayi Warrier, Swati Tirunal, K.C. Kesava Pillai and Thulasivanam.&#8220;I was initiated into music by my father, an accomplished singer and Kathakali performer. T. V. Gopalakrishnan happened to hear me once at Chembai Sangeetholsavam at Guruvayur. He was  impressed and I became his disciple. That was a turning point in my life.&#8220;I feel  I must learn more Malayalam songs. The intimacy with the mother tongue is really comfortable and the singer can sing with emotion. In future, you can expect at least one Malayalam song from me,&#8221; he said.Bottom Template Starts
