VVani Satish of Mysore gave a memorable vocal concert for `Swarajhari' of Vijayawada at Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram. A disciple of P.S. Narayanaswamy of Chennai, Vani is an A-Grade artiste of All India Radio. A resident of the U.S., Vani has also released a large number of CDs.Vani started the concert impressively with Begada Varnam following it with Tulasidalamulache in Mayamalavagoula in a leisurely manner, after which came Nadatanumanisam in Chittaranjani. Occasionally, Vani had a little trouble with her throat but that did not affect the overall impression due to her experience, resourcefulness and shrewd planning.One of the major items, Maramanam Umaramanam, a Tamil keertana in Hindolam, was beautifully sung. Vani expanded the alapana in sparkling detail, touching a chord in the listeners. However, the highlight of Vani's concert was the keertana Enduku Peddalavale in Sankarabharanam. Vani was able to bring out the grandeur and majesty of the composition, with rich niraval and crisp kalpana swarams.There was a thrilling tani by B.V.S. Prasad on the mridangam and K. V. Ramakrishna on the ghatam at the close of the Sankarabharanam keertana. V. Krishnaveni on the violin was very anticipative, and her versions of Hindola and Sankarabharanam were hauntingly sweet. Vani Satish closed the concert with Jagadodharana in Kafi and another Devaranama in Ragamalika.
