VBob Dylan turns 68 on May 24. But &#8216;The times, they aren&#8217;t a changin&#8217; for him. He has just released his 33rd studio album &#8220;Together Through Life,&#8221; is touring extensively, is making his presence felt in the art scene and yes, is as elusive as ever.He may not be as gung-ho about his birthday as the residents of Shillong, often referred to as the capital of rock music in India. For, in this serene hill town, Dylan&#8217;s birthday means festival time. And one man who takes centrestage and leads the festivities is blues folk musician Lou Majaw.Majaw, a respected musician of the region, has often been described as one of the biggest fans of Dylan in the North-East.  The life of this maverick guitarist forms the subject of &#8216;Forever Young,&#8217; a documentary by Ranjan Palit, to be telecast on NDTV&#8217;s Documentary 24x7 on May 24. In the film, the 60-plus rocker talks about his fascination for Dylan, whose songs he first heard in 1966. It took Palit, a Film Institute product, six years, 12 visits to Shillong and plenty of determination and dedication to complete &#8216;Forever Young.&#8217; The engrossing film tracks six years of Majaw&#8217;s life, music, passion and philosophy.In the film&#8217;s opening shot,.a large group of school children is singing &#8216;Forever Young&#8217; in chorus with Majaw, his guitar leading them. The song was  written by Dylan for his son Jakob. Hailing from a poor family, Majaw was sent to a hostel. Says he,  &#8220;My romance with the guitar began there. I would even sleep with it, never parted from the instrument.&#8221; There, he was introduced to the music of Bill Haley and Elvis Presley by a friend. But it was in Kolkata that Majaw chanced upon the genius of Dylan.  So taken in was he by the legendary songwriter-singer that he decided to organise a &#8216;Dylan&#8217;s birthday concert&#8217; in Shillong on May 24, 1972. And that became an annual event, a tradition that remains unbroken even after 37 years. Dylan fans across all over travel thousands of miles just to listen to Majaw and his band Ace of Spades croon, and reconnect with Dylan, the poet.
