Gopalan on mridangam.Subbalakshmi heralded her concert traditionally with a Natakuranji Varnam &#8211; Chelamela which she presented in madhyama kalam. She then went for a brief essay of Nata for Jaya Jaya Jayajanaki Kantha in Khandachapu-Jhampe talam. The swaraprasthara, though brief was interesting. She brought out a rare composition Kadanakutuhalaraga Priye of Pallavi Venkatarama Iyer that sounded more like the popular Raghuvamsa Sudha in this raga.Thodi was the main attraction of Subbalakshmi's concert for Karthikeya Gangeya Gowritanaya a rare number in Adi talam. This was of Papanasam Sivan. The raga essay had beautiful moves. The kriti rendition was quite clear in sahitya output. The nereval at the line Malmaraga Shanmukhamuruga guha was quite a devotional expression. Rajan's violin support was quite conducive in all its parts. The Tani Avartanam by mridangist P.S. Gopalan was impressive. The latter part had some light classical numbers.
