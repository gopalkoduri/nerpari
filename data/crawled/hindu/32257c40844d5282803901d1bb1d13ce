VWhen it came to the third numberAkhilandeswariinDwijavanthi, he slowed down so much that one felt it moved with a snail pacedvilambam, even inswaraprasthara.AfterVaranaradainViajayasriofThyagaraja, his concert highlight,Malayamarutham(Manasa Etulorthune) was performed. The raaga essay was simply brilliant and one wondered at the balancing act he displayed in presenting it in the three octaves with equal impact. Thekritirendition too was quite expressive, never sacrificing the raagabhava. Thenerevalandswara prastharamaintained the same tempo. One good thing in Vighnaraja&#8217;s rendition was that his ability to throw his voice and modulate it perfectly when needed. His vocal compass was good and the timber too quite rich. His vocal culture won him his first battle the moment he opened his mouth to tune with the instruments. However he reserved another number - Dikshitar&#8217;sSrikanthimatimin Hemavathi, forTani avartanam, perhaps hoping not to load the main number with more musical science.Endaro Mahanubhavuluhe rendered later pointed out at his great concentration onsahitya bhava.Thesangatieswere quite absorbing, projecting the inner meaning of thekritiwell. It was a display of right kind of control of emotion. An Annamacharya kirtanaNanati Batuku NatakamuinRevathiand a Purandaradasa&#8217;s devotional were the end numbers.
