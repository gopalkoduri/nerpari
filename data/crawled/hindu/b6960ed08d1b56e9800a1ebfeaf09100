VVibrancy, deep commitment and sensitivity to the nuances of classical music marked the breezy flute recital of Mala Chandrasekhar under the aegis of Alapana recently.Her graceful blowing of the instrument took her to lyrical heights and the resultant strains enthralled the rasikas. Her crisp and elegant rendition of songs was the outcome of her deep feelings for music. After the initial varnam, `Sree Raghukula' in Hamsadhwani was embellished with bright kalpanaswaras.`Sadhamatim' (Gambheeravani)  was soulful.  The alapana of Mohanam was bewitching with its musical intensity and the prayogas were sweet and clear for the song, `Mohana Rama.'Thejoie de vivreof the programme was the expansive alapana of Karaharapriya followed by a pallavi, `Daasarathe' in Adi talam, 2 kalais and she excelled in the raga sancharas of Ranjani, Saama, Kanada, Kaapi and Behag. The concluding numbers &#151;  `Santhi Nilava Vendum,' `Kaatrinile Varum Geetham' and `Kuraionrum Illai' gave a lilting finish to her musical agenda.M. R. Gopinath on the violin enhanced the content of the cutcheri.The spirited playing of Balashankar on the mridangam and Suresh on the ghatam gave an added impetus to the proceedings.T. K.
