VWhile it is appreciated that many organisations are promoting classical music by providing platforms for aspirants,  it is also regrettable that the venues and the corresponding infrastructure are far from satisfactory.Subha Ganesan&#8217;s concert for R.A. Puram Bhakta Jana Sabha suffered because of the echo and audio imbalance, resulting in uneven, smothered output from all artists. Subha qualified her concert with a variety of impressive ragas and kritis of Tyagaraja, Swati Tirunal, GNB and Koteswara Iyer.It was indeed relaxing to hear her delineate Hindolam with imaginative lines; the raga has such versatility that it could get along well with plenty of brigas and lengths of karvais in tandem. &#8216;Padmanabha Pahi&#8217; and the streams of swaras on the pallavi provided the joy of drenching in rain.Kiravani occupied centre stage with its extraordinary charm and Subha, to a great extent, did justice to her exhaustive elaboration.Had Subha&#8217;s internalisation of this particular raga been shown with touches of delicate reposes and finer nuances, the raga&#8217;s imagery would have been exemplary. Nonetheless, the raga flowed in continuum of alternating brigas, akaras and gamakas.It was a little surprising to note that M.A. Krishnaswamy on the violin was not his usual self; his presentation of Keeravani was rather lukewarm though Hindolam was passable. It was also evident that he was completely unhappy with  the unsatisfactory audio system. Neyveli Skanda Subramaniam (mridangam) and Papanasam Sethuraman (ganjira) discharged their part with sincerity and credit in spite of audio odds.
