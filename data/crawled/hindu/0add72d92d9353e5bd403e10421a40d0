VSinging for Visakha Music and Dance Academy (VMDA), Varanasi Sri Soumya, left an impression of being a bonanza of the future of carnatic music with her melodiously pliable voice marked withswara,layaandgaatra suddhieven at the age of 17. She was the disciple of the Hyderabad-based Nedunuri Shyamakrishna and is currently training under Neeta Chandrasekhar.Instant rapportBuilding up an instant rapport with her were the equally young and gifted accompanists G.V.S. Raghuram on violin and A. Ananda Srihari, son of the renowned Kuchipudi exponent A.B. BalakondalaRao, on one hand and the listeners on the other. She got off to a tunefully grand start with theSahana Varnam.After renderingMahaganapathi(Nata),Anupamagunaambudhi(Athana) that was adorned with a brief but beautifulalapana, she went on to singSadaasaaranga(Ranjani),Vaade Venkataadri(Vasantha), where she skilfully brought out the sublime shades ofSriranjaniin her aalapana. She also sangSogasugamridangataalamuevocatively and concluded it with a brisk and knowledgeableswarakalpanain the two different speeds.Then after renderingKanjadalayadaakshi(Kamalamanohari),Pahipahi(Jonepuri) she came out with an exquisite elaboration ofEnduko Neemanasu(Kalyani). Her expression ofmanodharmawas exquisite.Smooth executionWhile Raghuram proved his mettle on violin during his turns in particular, Srihari, in his subtle following, smoothly executed a meaningfultanithat contributed to the grandeur.The tailpiece comprised the rendering ofRamajogimanduof Ramadas inKhamasand theBrindavani Tillana. While Dr. P.V.C. Sarma introduced the young artistes, chief guest of the evening P.V.
