VGuru Harihar Rath has been imparting training in Hindustani  classical music to his students over the last many years. That might be  passé, but what is not is the annual concert he has been organising for the last eight years. At this concert his students are asked to perform before an invited audience and apart from getting a valuable exposure in the presence of their guru, the disciples also get their flaws ironed out and gain in confidence, so  essential for a performing artiste.This year the concert was held at  Rasaraj Geetikunja on May 1, the birthday of the guru. More than  20 of his students  performed with Guru Harihar Rath himself bringing up the  rendition in the rare raagSaraswatiand a bhajan inBhairavi. It was gratifying to hear youngsters renderingkhayalwith sincerity and involvement. The performances were not flawless, but they definitely signalled their budding talents. A number of raags from elementaryBhupali, DurgaandKafitoDesh, Bhimpalasi, Khamaj, Yaman, Bageshree, Alheya Bilawal, Tilang, Behag, Goud Sarang, Kedar, Brundabani Sarangwere presented by the young talents, like Rupali, Jasmin, Manisha, Bubu, Soma, Munmun, Nandini, Sanu, Ruchi, Prachi, Sukababu, Shantashree, Aruna, Kamalini, Lipi, Bulbul, Sony, Gajal, Payal and Tapi.The  guru's son Amit Rath,  who renderedRageshreeimpressed the audience with his amazing control over the notes. Another student who stood out was Payal who has the requisite stamina in her voice to withstand the pressures of classical singing.At a time when the patronage for  classical music seems to be on the wane Guru Sri Rath has surely succeeded in his "Catch em' Young" campaign.B.M.Bottom Template Starts
