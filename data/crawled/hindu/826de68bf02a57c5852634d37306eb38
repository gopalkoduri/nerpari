VNirmala Sundararajan proved to be a tradition-bound artiste, both in her style of rendition and in her method of structuring concert pattern and the presentation. So familiar are her movements in raga expansion andswara prasthara, that they sound like disciplined lessons.All these traits were revealed in her concert organised by the South Indian Cultural Association (SICA), last week at Ravindra Bharati. Nirmala, who is an `A' grade Carnatic vocalist was quite at home in her concert from the start. The influence on her of different gurus she learned under - Ramnad Krishnan, P. N. Raghava Rao, T. Mukta and T. M. Thyagarajan  -   shaped her into a well-informed performer. Nirmala set herself well in this concert for SICA, right with her openingKalyaniata tala varnam.She revealed pleasing voice with reasonable range. She was in the company of Poorna Vaidyanathan on violin, P. V. Kamaraju on mridangam and Srinivasa Gopalan on morsing, who too proved a good combination in this opening exercise. Then the compositions that were presented by Nirmala carried varied appeal. Of themDeva Deva Kalayami, a composition of Swathi Thirunal inMayamalava Gowla, sounded quite a refreshing number. She took good time for this by adding an expansivenerevaland crispswara Prasthara, enhancing the appeal of the number. She then rendered a well-set TamilkirtanainAthana. She took up Sriranjani as first raga delineation and went for the delineation. She presentedBhuvini Dasudaniin this. The melody shaped up well and thekritirendition too was pleasant. She then gave more time forVaralidelineation. She sangSeshachala Nayakamof Dikshitar in this raga. After renderingIntakante Kavalenain Kannada, Nirmala took upKambhojias her main effort of the concert.  The violinist Poorna gave brief version of the raga. Nirmala's choice composition for this raga was tO Rangasayi.The rendition was marked by her expressivenerevalaccentuating the beauty of thecharanamshe chose to do that. And the breezy spell ofnerevalfollowed by exercisingswaras, and the impressiveTani avartanambetween mridangam and morsing, added to the appeal.GSBottom Template Starts
