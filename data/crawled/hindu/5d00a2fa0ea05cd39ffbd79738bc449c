VVisakha Music and Dance Academy featured a vocal recital by Akondi Srinivasa Raja Rao in its auditorium Kalaabharathi last Wednesday. Senior artiste G. Annaji Rao on violin and young but highly talented mridangam player Mangalagiri Sridhar accompanie\u000ad him.Warming up with the rendering of a varnam,Jayajaya Ramaanadhaof Narayana Teertha in naata concluded with swaram andSita Lakshamana Sahithamprefixed with brief aalapana, Akondi tunefully set himself into an evo\u000acative mood despite opting a pacy tempo.The rendering ofDurmargacharaadhamula(ranjani),Chani Todi Teve(harikambhoji),Nanubrovamani Cheppaveof Ramadas in kalyani andRaaga Sudharasa(aandolika) adorned with bri\u000aef aalapanas though was sans any sort of variation in tempo which was as much racy in pace as the earlier ones, attracted good response.Next, the elaboration ofNanupaalimpa(mohana) including the aalapana, rendering of the lyric, neravu and swaram though was knowledgeable and occasionally even tended erudite, could not attract as much response it deserved because o\u000af no noticeable change in the tempo.Next came an eruditely structured ragam and tanam for the intricately coined PallaviNammitinammain thodi in Trisra Roopakam with the Padagarbham placed at a gap of five kriyas after starting of the marking of the talam.Later it was made to assume the form of a Panchanada exercise by way of shifts into Chaturasram, Misram, Khandam and Sankeernam and got concluded with swaram in ragamaalika. But unfortunately, it also sounded monotonous because of the adaptation of the same speed.While Annaji Rao on violin provided the much needed relief of raciness in his turns, Sridhar&#8217;s exposition of the layabhava while following and executing Thani as well was replete with good gusto and contributed grandeur.A.R.SBottom Template Starts
