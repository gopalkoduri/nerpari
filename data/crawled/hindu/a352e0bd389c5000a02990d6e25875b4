VManjira Foundation organised a Hindustani vocal recital of Amarendra Dhaneshwar recently in Bangalore.Dhaneshwar, a senior freelance journalist, is an exponent of the Gwalior gharana and husband and disciple of well-known vocalist Neela Bhagwat.Dhaneshwar rendered all the vilambit khayal compositions in the not-so-popular and a rather convoluted tala Tilwada, a rhythmic cycle of 16 beats.It was an exhilarating experience to listen to the avartans of Tilwada, the contours of which were boldly accentuated in the deft strokes of Keshav Joshi on the tabla. Dhaneshwar commenced his recital with the evening melody Purvi. The vilambit tilwada bandish &#8220;Charan parsat jiyara more tan man sukh paave&#8221; was followed by the lilting drut teen tal bandish &#8220;Saware man lagire&#8221;, a composition of Pandit Sharadchandra Arolkar, a great composer and a Gwalior gharana maestro. In his alaap, Dhaneshwar highlighted the quintessential aspects of raag Purvi.His chota khayal renditions were remarkable for the clarity of enunciation. His sapat taans demonstrated his proficiency in layakari. His tarana rendition in Purvi was again a testimony to his impeccable sense of laya.Exploring another popular dwi-madhyama raag Kedar, he sang the Meera Bhajan &#8220;Shree giridhar aage naachoongi&#8221;.A chaturang composition in raag Desh, comprising four main constituents, namely the characteristic features of a khayal, tarana, lakshana geet and swara geet elicited much applause from the audience. After a soulful ghazal bandish in raag Bihag &#8220;Jis ke dil par guzari wohi jaane to kya jaane&#8221;, Dhaneshwar concluded his recital with a tappa in raag Bhairavi in another rare tala &#8212; Pashtoo. Ravindra Katoti&#8217;s harmonium accompaniment enhanced the melodic appeal of the concert.*** Sapthak Music Association hosted the vocal recital of Dhananjay Hegde, disciple of Pandit Vinayak Torvi, who has already carved a niche for himself in the concert circuits of Bangalore. He began his recital with raag Marwa, a Sandhiprakash raga and presented two compositions: &#8220;Piya anant des gaye&#8221; in vilambit ektal and &#8220;Mayiri saanj bhayi&#8221; in drut teen tal. He embellished the khayal bandishes with different taan patterns.This was followed by the madhyalaya teen tal bandish &#8220;Dhoondu ban saiyya&#8221; in raag Nand and a lyrical drut teen tal bandish &#8220;Dhan dhan bhag&#8221;. After a Surdas bhajan and a Dasara Pada, Dhananjay concluded his recital with a bhajan in Bhairavi.Umakanth Puranik and Raghavendra Nakod provided the harmonium and tabla accompaniment respectively.
