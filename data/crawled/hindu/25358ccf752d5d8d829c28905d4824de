VIt was a well-planned concert as  the  compositions chosen  were perfect for  the occasion. The outcome was  a rewarding experience for  the rasikas. The two-day  40th  anniversary celebrations of Sri Vishnu Sahasranama Satsangam, New Delhi, including this three-hour concert by Haripriya and Shanmukhapriya,  will linger for long in the memory  of the Capital&#8217;s connoisseurs. The organisers deserveto be lauded for including a full-fledged Carnatic music concert by renowned artistes as part of the  celebrations.After an impressive start-up varnam, the duo popularly known as Priya Sisters sang  a composition of Papanasam Sivam, &#8220;Tatvamariyatarama&#8221; in raga Ritigowla. The  rendering of  &#8220;Bagayanayya&#8221;in  raga Chandrajyoti and &#8220;Entamuddo&#8221; in  raga Bindumalini brought out the emotive aspects of these Tyagarajacompositions well.  The sisters then presented  impressively a composition of Gopalakrishna Bharati, &#8220;Tillai Ambalatanai Govindarajanai&#8221; in  raga Suruti &#8212; a composition rarely taken up in concerts. Earlier, Haripriya presented a fine sketch of this raga. The singers  handled well &#8220;Bhajareremanasa&#8221;, a composition of Mysore Vasudevacharya in  raga Abheri, bringing  both the intricacies of the raga and  its sahitya bhava to the fore. Earlier, the sisters presented a detailed sketch of this raga in turns.The subsequent swaraprastaras and the culminating korvai bore testimony to the duo&#8217;s competence in the  improvisational aspects of music. Similarly, while singing  &#8220;Ranganayakam&#8221;, a slow-tempo composition of Muthuswami Dikshitar in raga Nayaki, the finer aspects of the raga as well as its  sahitya bhava were highlighted. As the main composition, the duo took up  Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Mohana Rama&#8221; in  raga Mohanam. Haripriya delineated this raga in stages, bringing out its complete essence . Her sancharam around the note Sa in the higher octave was scintillating. Apart from a scholarly rendering  of the composition as such, the sisters  presented niraval of the phrase &#8220;Mohanarama modhadi daivama&#8221;, which was rich in creativity. Incidentally, this was the only niraval presented  in their entire concert. The subsequent swara formats were also rich in creativity. Even the songs that were presented after the tani avartanam (percussion solo) continued to be lively and  kept the  listeners glued to their seats. The contributions of the accompanying artistes too  made the concert engaging. M.A. Sundaresan  provided excellent support on the violin . Apart from closely following the singers, Sundaresan presented a good account of himself while delineating the ragas Suruti, Abheri and Mohanam and the subsequent swaraprastaras. Neyveli Skanda Subramanian showed  understanding and was excellent in his accompaniment on  the mridangam. His tani avartanam in Adi tala and his laya depiction in the  slow-tempo songs were delightful. Mannai Kannan&#8217;s accompaniment on  the ghatam  was good but he needed to rise  to the occasion. His accompaniment was  eclipsed by Skanda on the  mridangam.Shanmukhapriya and Haripriya, popularly known as the Priya Sisters, had their initial training since the age of five under their father V.V. Subba Ram, a disciple of Harikesanallur Sri Vaidyalinga Bhagavathar (son of Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar). Later on, they came under the tutelage of Radha and Jayalakshmi. Currently, they are continuing their training under Professor T.R. Subramaniam.
