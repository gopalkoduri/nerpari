VAnanthapadmanabhan following the Hindustani style while performing with Hindustani vocalist Ramesh Narayan.The Madhuvanti raga elaboration by Ramesh witnessed a fast progression in the alaap.  The Bada Khayal &#8216;Kahe maan dharo sakhi ri&#8217; was made pleasing with emotive rendering. The chotakhayal was replete with sargams and boltans, and along with the sargam the unique style of the Jasraj school brought out a   striking effect. It was a sad sight to see the veena being limited to only  a few points in this piece.The next was a cheez &#8216;Tum bin kaise kate ratiya&#8217; in raag Jog, in Madhya laya, again embellished with swift taans and murkhis. Ramesh then rendered  his own composition &#8216;Parayaan maranna paribhavangal&#8217; from the movie &#8216;Garshom&#8217; in the same raag. Soft touches  and brisk moves on the veena made Ananthapadmanabhan&#8217;s playing memorable.Ananthapadmanabhan demonstrated the veena&#8217;s versatility by playing  Hindustani pieces.  Aditya Narayan Banerjee supported the performers on the tabla. Like  his guru,  Pandit Jasraj, Ramesh too, before an alaap, prefers to recite a  shloka in most numbers.He broke into a bhajan &#8216;Govinda Madhava Madhaveti&#8217; in raag Nat Bhairav, which was amply supported by Hema Narayanan on the vocals and Vijay Senan on the harmonium. The singing reached a crescendo in &#8216;Naamsankeerthan&#8217; in the high octave. The programme was organised by Bank Employees&#8217; Arts Movement (BEAME).
