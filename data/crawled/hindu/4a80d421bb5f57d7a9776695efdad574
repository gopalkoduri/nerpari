VJust as Asia is getting back to its feet after the tsunami disaster, a handful of artistes from various parts of the continent decide to come together to create a tune of harmony. And what do they sing? That immortal anthem called "Give Peace A Chance" created by that musical legend of peace named John Lennon.The album called "Peace, Love and Truth" is a collection of the musical life and times of John Lennon. Featuring tracks ranging from "Hold On" to "Imagine" and "Help me To Help Myself", the album makes us embark on a nostalgic journey to the times of the Beatles, and gives us reason enough to believe how miraculously it still makes sense in today's world. A 2005 version of "Give Peace A Chance" sung in unison by the Voices of Asia, is a project undertaken by the Yoko Ono Lennon label with EMI Music to recreate a classic and give it a contemporary feel, maintaining the original vocals of Lennon. Shaan represents India along with Junoon from Pakistan, Ronald Cheng from Hong Kong, Alicia Pan from Taiwan and many more artistes from Asia. Says Talking about his experience, Shaan says, "Collaborations of this kind are always for a good cause which makes it all worthwhile. The concept is relatively new and so it was highly challenging. We did not tamper with the original vocals that were recorded live in a hotel room. All of us went to studios in our respective countries and sang our lines. What we heard in the end blew us off our feet." Shaan was a part of a similar collaboration a year back with Blue's "One Love".A.VISHNUBottom Template Starts
