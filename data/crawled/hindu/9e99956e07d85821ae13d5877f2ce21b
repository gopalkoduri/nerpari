VIt is said that to do something well one has to thoroughly enjoy doing it. This aptly sums up the brilliant vocal concert of Prasanna Venkatraman, held the other day  at the India International Centre in the Capital. It was a joyful and heartening ex\u000aperience too, to see this exuberant 25-year-old  bubbling with confidence throughout his recital in both the departments &#8212; the structured and the improvised.Prasanna began impressively with &#8220;Ninne bhajana&#8221;, a composition of Tyagaraja in  raga Nattai. The presentation of this composition as such, the inbuilt chittaswaras and the subsequent lively swaraprastaras not only gave him a brisk start, but  served as an early indicator of his musical talents too. After this, Prasanna straightaway  took up a detailed presentation of &#8220;Bhajare re chita&#8221; a composition of Muthuswami  Dikshitar in raga Kalyani. He presented a fine sketch of this raga, which was characterised by  a maturity rarely seen in musicians of his age. His subsequent neraval of the phrase &#8220;Deveem saktibeejodhbhava matrukarna sarerenem&#8221; and swaraprastaras flowed with rich creativity.Carnatic music concerts at the India International Centre are generally  around one-and-a-half to two  hours only, unlike the traditional sabha concerts ranging from two-and-a-half to three  hours. To put up an impressive show within this duration, the artiste not only has to pack his concert with  intelligently selected compositions and ragas reflective of his musical talents, but also judiciously utilise every moment. Prasanna scored in this aspect too,  as well as in allotting sufficient time for  his co-artistes to showcase their talents.While presenting &#8220;Neye saran Shanmugha&#8221;, a slightly fast tempo composition of Papanasam Sivan in the raga Kamboji, Prasanna brought  the emotive aspect  to the fore. For the main  presentation of his concert, Prasanna took up Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Sukhi yevvaro&#8221; in  raga Kanada. Apart from an elegant presentation of this composition bringing out both the raga  and the sahitya bhava to the fore, Prasanna prefixed  it with a scintillating alapana of the raga and suffixed it with enjoyable swaraprastaras.Prasanna&#8217;s post-tani session wasn&#8217;t a dull one, either. It was packed with emotive Hindustani raga-based bhajan, tillana and a composition each of Gopalakrishna Bharati and Subramania Bharati.Delhi&#8217;s VSK Annadurai on the violin and Kumbakonam N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam ably assisted Prasanna. Apart from closely following Prasanna on the violin, Annadurai&#8217;s sketch of ragas Kalyani and Kanada were good, though there certainly  existed scope for  rising further to the occasion. Padmanabhan&#8217;s understanding support throughout the recital and tani avartanam in Adi tala were enjoyable.It&#8217;s time now for Prasanna to progressively direct his concentration towards weighty compositions and  their sahitya bhava.&#8226;Prasanna Venkatraman, an engineer with an M. Tech.  degree, has learnt Carnatic music underGuru T. R. Balamani of Mumbai for 15 years.&#8226;Currently, he is under the tutelage of renowned musicians T.K. Govinda Rao and Sanjay Subrahmanyan.&#8226;Prasanna&#8217;s concert at the Music Academy last season(December 2007) won him the &#8216;Best Junior Concert&#8217;and &#8216;Best Kalpana Swara Rendition&#8217; awards.
