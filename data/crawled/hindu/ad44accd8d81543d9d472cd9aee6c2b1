VThe first edition of Dance Discourse 2011, held recently in Bangalore and devoted to the Mysore School of Bharathanatya, began with Choodamani Nandagopal's lecture establishing the antiquity of the style and tracing its evolution with references to historical and literary texts, inscriptions and sculpture.A demonstration of items culled form its distinct repertoire began with pooja nritya, an invocatory piece, ably performed by Tejaswini to incantational verses dedicated to Lord Ganesha and set to Revathi raga. A prabandha set to Kamavardhini raga and khanda jathi matya thala with arresting chollukettu, swara and sahithya components was presented by Pulakeshi Kasturi. Veena Shreedhar Morab's exposition of the parakeeya nayika, a married woman enamoured of another, in the Kshetrayya padam in Bhairavi was accentuated by gentle movements and charming abhinaya. A mangala shloka selected from the many that form part of the tradition, set to Madhyamavathi raga and extolling the beauty and adornments of Lord Krishna, was exquisitely represented by Padmini Shreedhar, bringing to a close a segment that was a throwback to quieter and more spacious times.A video clip of the legendary Venkatalakshamma's interpretation of the shloka beginning &#8220;Andandena Yashodaya&#8221;, one of the highlights of the evening, was followed by one of students performing the Poorvaranga Vidhi. Mala Shashikanth's talk on the four traditions of Mugur, Kolar, Mysore and Nanjangud, was followed by a panel discussion that touched upon the fortunes of this ancient style during the last fifty years, led by revered guru C. Radhakrishna, one of the torchbearers of the style.***The 46 {+t} {+h} Annual Music Festival of the Karnataka College of Percussion Trust began with a concert by violin maestro T.N. Krishnan, accompanied by T.A.S. Mani (mridanga), and Ranganatha Chakravarthy (ghata).Dikshithar's &#8220;Vallabha Nayakasya&#8221; in Begada raga and rupaka thala, embellished with crisp kalpana swaras, was followed by a mellifluous rendering of &#8220;Orajupu&#8221; in Kannadagoula raga and adi thala. Panthuvarali was elaborated in a masterly exposition of the artiste's style, punctuated by smooth arching usages and ornamented by the ebb and flow of modulated sancharas. Thyagaraja's &#8216;Raghuvara' in adi thala, was supplemented with a compact neraval and kalpana swaras.A mellow contrast was provided with the perennial favourite &#8220;Evarani&#8221;, set to Devamrithavarshini raga and adi thala. While the alapana of Yadukulakamboji that followed was replete with soft touches and key phrases brimming with the essence of the raga, &#8220;Hecharikaga Rara&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in khanda chapu thala was rendered in a leisurely tempo and adorned with an enchanting neraval and kalpana swaras. The plaintive allure of Mukhari, explicit in a brief alapana, was sustained in the ensuing Annamacharya composition &#8220;Brahma Kadigina Padamu&#8221; in adi thala.The alapana of Surutti that followed was a seamless blend of vintage classicism and aesthetic appeal, studded with special touches unique to the raga, effectively heralding Thyagaraja's &#8220;Geetharthamu&#8221; in adi thala. Concise kalpana swaras in two speeds affixed to the pallavi led to a thani avarthana that reaffirmed the superlative quality of the percussion ensemble, which contributed to the success of the concert in no mean measure.
