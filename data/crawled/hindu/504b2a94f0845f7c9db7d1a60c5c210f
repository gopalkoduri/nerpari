VWhen a vidwan or vidushi has the potential to measure the beauty of the sangita content of the compositions of Sri Tyagaraja and their depth, the concert cannot but be of a high order.The performance of Gayatri Girish on Tyagaraja aradhana day held by Sri Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha approximated to these ideals. Sahitya wealth, aesthetic touches and structural compactness represent the zenith of the saint&#8217;s genius. Gayatri chose particularly songs that are replete with these qualities.The very first item &#8216;Mundu Venuga&#8217; (Durbar) affixed a stamp of majesty and her rendering meticulously brought out the raga&#8217;s musical luxury embedded in it. Every tune of the sangatis carried a spell of fascination, an endearing aspect of the saint&#8217;s technique to hold us captive.Similar in approach was &#8216;Maaru Balka&#8217; (Sriranjani) with the scintillating sangatis, both charming and highly cherishable. Her vision of the song&#8217;s lilt directed her interpretative style. While handling the robust sangatis, she saw to it that their grace was not lost. That marked the essence of interpretative scholarship.&#8216;Entani Ne Varnintunu&#8217; (Mukhari with an alapana) and &#8216;Maamava Satatam&#8217; (Jaganmohini) were hemmed in between the earlier part and the latter more rewarding segment of the kutcheri.The raga Varali was clothed brilliantly with sharp precision tapping in her stride the richness of the raga&#8217;s shades. The elaboration was set to unearth the different layers of the raga&#8217;s appeal. The voice in good shape at that stage, could explore with great insight the strength and the delights of Varali, all the trio adhering to the decorum of good music. The kirtana was &#8216;Karuna Elagante.&#8217;The raga of the evening was Khambodi (&#8216;Mari Mari Ninne Moralida&#8217;). Madhyamakala sancharas and speedy passages marking change of pace in the alapana technique with a clever adjustment of vocal modulation and direction spoke of her creative process. Virile stimulations in unfolding the length and breadth of Khambodi were the decisive factor in the picturisation. The exposition was intensely penetrative, but all the same soundly restrained.The song was stately studded with a plethora of sangatis, classical and slicing in musical structuring. Her training and sadhaka helped her preserve the grandeur of the mounting sangatis and they came alive delightfully. The whole exercise was challengingly marathon-like.The violin accompaniment by B. U. Ganesh Prasad progressed with lyrical softness and playing restraint. His delineation of Varali and Khambodi was admirably concise, carefully structured and fluently expressed. The manner in which he laid out the sancharas was exhilaratingly appealing. There was character and calibre in his play.Neyveli Skandasubramaniam (mridangam) and K.V. Gopalakrishnan (kanjira) provided the percussive wing. The former&#8217;s moorings in accompanying technique stood him in good stead. His snapshot thani pattern was noteworthy.
