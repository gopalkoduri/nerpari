VSudha Raghunath&#8217;s vocal concert at Vadakkanthara Thirupuraikkal Bhagavathi Temple was more of a  devout musical offering than a full-fledged classical concert. The concert was held in connection with the Valiyavilakkuvela.Endowed with a soothing and mellifluous voice, Sudha, a senior practitioner of the G.N.B-M.L.V. bani, has carved a niche for herself with her unique style of rendering with accent on  purity and perfection. She was accompanied by  Pakkala Ramadas on the violin, Palladam Ravi on the mridangam and Raman on the morsing.A lively &#8216;Mathe Malayadhwajapandhya samjathe,&#8217; a Sanskrit Daruvarnam of Muthiah Bhagavathar,  set to Adi tala, was sung in two speeds and ornamented with fast-paced jathis.  It was preceded by a sloka on Lord Ganesha, &#8216;Gajananam&#8217; in Hamsadhwani, which was soaked in devotion.&#8216;Pahi pahi Balaganapathe,&#8217; a composition of Chidambara Bharathi, set to Roopaka tala, was enriched with lilting chittaswara and brilliant manodharmaswara, mostly revolving around the upper octaves.A majestic composition of Dikshitar &#8216;Renukadevi samrakshithoham,&#8217; a hymn on the mother of Parasurama in raga Kannadabangala, set to Khandhachappu tala, was adorned with swarakalpana. &#8216;Ka vava,&#8217; Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s composition on Lord Muruga in Varali, was followed by a picturesque portrayal of the raga Saramathi for Tygaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Mokshamu galada.&#8217; &#8216;Annapoorne Visalakshee,&#8217; a Dikshitar composition in Sama, was sung with a great deal of emphasis on the diction of the lyrics. A brisk Tyagaraja kriti, &#8216;Bandureethi kolu&#8217; in Hamsanadam, which came next, was  appended with enlivening niraval and manodharmaswara.Mohanam, the main raga chosen for detailed elaboration, was  unfurled smoothly,   with perfect sruthi alignment. However, there were a few hitches in the  lower octaves. The succeeding composition was &#8216;Jagadeeswary, krupai puri,&#8217; set to Adi tala. Sudha&#8217;s rendition captured the mood and spirit of the  Thiruvaroor Ramaswami Pillai composition and it was  embellished with creative swarakalpana, woven into Jhandha and Dhattu prayogas. The thaniavarthanam of Palladam Ravi and Raman saw arithmetical phrases.Sudha&#8217;s masterpiece &#8216;Kurayondrumillai,&#8217; a song  immortalised by the legendary M.S., was, however, not up to her usual standard. She made up for it with a bhava-laden presentation of Purandaradasa&#8217;s &#8216;Innudayabarade&#8217;  in Kalyanavasantham.&#8217; She also sang &#8216;Brahmamokate&#8217;  in Bouli and &#8216;Kandanal muthalai&#8217;  in Madhuvanthi. Sudha wound up the concert with &#8216;Santhi nilava vendum&#8217; in Thilang, creating a serene atmosphere.
