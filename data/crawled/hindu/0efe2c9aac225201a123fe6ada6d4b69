VKosmic MusicAneesh VidyashankarCarnatic Classical (violin)Audio CD (Rs. 125)The inlay card of Kosmic Music&#8217;s violin Carnatic CD of Aneesh Vidyashankar refers to him as a prodigy. The test of time will reveal if this talented artist has lived up to this presented image. &#8216;Vathapi Ganapathim&#8217;  is the opening n\u000aumber and is rendered in an appropriate tempo with kalpanaswaras for the opening lyric. The first ratna amongst the Pancharatna kritis of Tyagaraja &#8216;Jagadanandakaraka&#8217; (Nattai) is rendered well with a feel for the sahitya. Senior mridangist C.Cheluvaraju literally plays this song on the mridangam and adds to the effective rendering by Aneesh.&#8216;Raghuvamsasudha&#8217; of Patnam Subramanya Iyer in Kadanakuduhalam has been played with restraint.  A brief but convincing vinyasa of Bahudari precedes &#8216;Brovabharama&#8217; (Tyagaraja). The kalpanaswaras are competent and the final swara chain is typical of the Parur style. Another bhajan &#8216;Raghupathi Raghava&#8217; is a soothing rendition.Aneesh next renders mini alapanas of Bilahari, Kalyana Vasantham and Kalyani of which there is no mention in the inlay card. The alapanas are however pleasing versions.  &#8216;Krishna Nee Begane&#8217; in Yamankalyani of Vyasaraya pleasantly brings down the curtains on this disc.Apart from the mridangist (C. Cheluvaraju) ghatam and tavil accompaniments have  been provided by Dayananda Mohite and R. Rajkumar. Their thani avarthanam is simple, precise and to the point and successfully becomes an extension of the Bahudari song. Aneesh&#8217;s bowing is strong and he exhibits his taste for classical values. With proper guidance he should soon create waves.PVK
