VThe orchestral show was opened with the popular Hamsadhwani piece -Vatapi Ganapathimand followed it with an evergreen composition of Thyagarja&#8217;sPancharatna kirtana-Endaro Mahanubhavuluin Sri Ragam. A special piece named asMallariwas played in ragaGambheeranata, inKhandajati Triputa Talamthat alone stretched to almost an hour.Mallariis originally a part ofUtsava Sampradaya kirtanas, developed more a rhythmic exercise. This was originally developed as temple art in Tamil Nadu. Initially there used to be only nadaswaram and dolu combination, now other instruments have also been added. It uses the techniques ofGopucha Yati,Srotovahati YatiandDhmaruka Yatiin presentation.It is a bit similar to Siva Tandava style of rhythm, with the other instruments giving a musical strain inGambheeranataraga, which suits this kind of experiment.This was first said to have been experimented by mridangam maestro Tiruvarur Bhaktavatsalam. The present team in Hyderabad appears to be popularising it. Other items played by the ensemble were a Meera BhajanPayoji Mainein Pahadi,Pibare Rama Rasamof Sadasiva Brahmendra inAhir Bhairaviand aPurandaradasa kirtanain Sindhu Bhairavi, adding to the concluding part. However, this programme proved to be something different from the routine musical concert exercises.
