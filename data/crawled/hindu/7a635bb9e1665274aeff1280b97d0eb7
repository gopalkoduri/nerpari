VMusiri and Venkatraman share a special connection. Shri.Musiri and Venkataraman&#8217;s guru K.S.Narayanaswami  learnt from Sabhesa Iyer.The concert on April 9 was a feast for the ears with the aesthetic surroundings bestowing  an intimate and classy aura.Starting with a Saveri varnam, the concert proceeded to &#8216;Deva Deva Kalayami&#8217; in Mayamalava Gowla. This was noted for some splendid swara passages.&#8216;Aparama Bhakthi&#8217; (Pantuvarali) and &#8216;Tana Vari Tanamu&#8217; (Begada) were also of a high standards laying the  foundation for the main song, &#8216;Rama Rama Gunaseema&#8217; in Simhendramadhyamam (Swati Tirunal).If the present day veena was modified by the Nayaks to facilitate greater shifts in the swara passages, Venkatraman fully exploited the same. The ragam was superb and the tanam even better.  Several passages of the song were as close to the vocal modulations as any instrument could get.The vidwan was able to fully bring out the emotion of the composer where he begs for the grace of Lord Rama. The performances of Sathish on  the mridangam and T.V.Vasan on  the ghatam also  enhanced the effort  as they did the entire concert.The music continued to be soulful,  mostly songs by Swati Tirunal,  including &#8216;Sri Ramachandra&#8217; (Huseini), rather rarely heard on concert platforms these days.  Swati Tirunal&#8217;s padam in Dvijavanti, where the Nayika begs her friends to tell Lord Padmanabha of her miserable state, was also beautifully played bringing out the feeling of pathos and evoking a sense of melancholy.Swati Thirunal&#8217;s compositions in Sindu Bhairavi (&#8216;Visvesvar&#8217;), Kapi and Behag were some of the other songs that were excellently played. The Chenchuruti Javali, &#8216;Sakhi Prana&#8217; on the great vainika Dhanammal, was also movingly played.The curtains fell leaving the rasikas with memories of ragas deftly handled.The vidwan&#8217;s choice of songs deserves mention.  &#8216;Rama Rama Gunaseema&#8217; and &#8216;Sri Ramachandra&#8217; were songs that Musiri was famous for.The intense bhava that he injected, his slow but masterful kalapramana that would bring out the intense emotions of the composer were all there in the veena rendering.It was particularly appropriate that this concert came on the eve of Rama Navami.To create the same emotional appeal on  an instrument without the sahitya is not an easy task but the vidwan was able to do so with ease and &#233;lan.
