VEndowed with a good voice, N.J. Nandini, a Thiruvananthapuram-based youngster still in her teens, structured her maiden concert in the Capital very impressively the other day. Nandini presented song after song that spoke highly of her depth in Carnatic music. The concert was organised jointly by Gayathri Fine Arts and the India International Centre at the latter's auditorium. The short virutham spanning a couple of minutes which preceded the invocation song on Lord Vinayaka in raga Hamsadhwani provided ample hints of her musical talent at the very outset.Nandini's crisp and fast-paced swaraprastaras that followed &#8220;Namami Vighnavinayaka&#8221; (Hamsadhwani) was lively. In Swati Tirunal's &#8220;Jayajaya Padmanabhaanujesha&#8221; in raga Manirangu, she brought out the finer aspects of this raga embedded in the lyrics. Tarangampadi Panchanada Iyer's composition &#8220;Biranabrova ide&#8221; in raga Kalyani and Tyagaraja's &#8220;Dachukovalena&#8221; in Todi underwent elaborate treatment. Nandini gave a good account of herself handling these items including the creative aspects like delineating these ragas, niraval and the swaraprastaras. However, one feels she should avoid the graha beda techniques at this point of her career. Delhi's VSK Chakrapani provided enthusiastic and encouraging support on the violin. N.J. Nandagopal, Nandini's elder brother, provided understanding support on the mridangam and played a riveting tani avartanam (percussion solo) in Misra jati Jhampa tala.Ramanavami concertIn another concert organised at the Capital's Sarvodaya Enclave on the occasion of Ramanavami, Delhi's Vasanthy Krishna Rao too delighted the audience and treated them to a session of wonderful music that evening. She came up with some well presented compositions on Lord Ram. Ramnad Srinivasa Iyengar's &#8220;Paramapavana Rama&#8221; in the raga Poorvikalyani, which was the central piece of her concert, underwent fine treatment. The alapana of this raga, subsequent niraval and swaraprastaras revealed the depth of her creative talent. Dikshitar's &#8220;Mamava Pattabhirama&#8221; in Manirangu and &#8220;Rangapura vihara&#8221; in Brindavana Saranga not only suited the occasion but were also presented very melodiously.Delhi's R. Sridhar rose to the occasion and provided her very good support on the violin. K. Sreeram, Vasanthy's younger brother, accompanied well on the mridangam. A fine recital reflecting her vidwat in the field of Carnatic music.Music in the Park&#8216;What good is it to run when you are going on the wrong path', goes a proverb. U. Shrinivas was doing exactly this in his mandolin concert during the Music in Park series, organised recently at the Capital's Nehru Park. In his concert of about an hour, Shrinivas took up a ragam-taanam-pallavi in raga Manavati (fifth melakarta raga) set to Adi tala. The choice of this raga, in which only a few songs are known to have been composed, did not seem to be a well thought out one. This session went on for almost three-fourths of the time available to him. In a detailed delineation of the raga, Shrinivas was doing an exercise of merely connecting various swaras in different combinations. A pallavi designed even in ragas Kanada or Kapi in which Shrinivas presented ragamalika swaraprastaras (besides in ragas Manavati and Bindumalini) could have been enjoyable. Shrinivas started his concert with a Tyagaraja composition and finished with a Sai bhajan. Shrinivas was accompanied by V.V. Srinivasa Rao on the violin, S. Swaminathan on the mridangam and Kannan on the morsing.Bhakti utsavAt the Bhakti Utsav organised past this weekend at the Nehru Park, Vijay Siva treated the cosmopolitan audience to some fine renderings of the compositions of Tyagaraja, Muttuswami Dikshitar, Shyama Sastri, Purandaradasa and Arunagirinathar which were appropriately loaded with bhakti rasa. He was accompanied by Mullaivasal G. Chandramouli on the violin and Manoj Siva on the mridangam.
