VThe heavy overtones of Thodi relatively early in the violin duet of Kanyakumari and disciple Embar Kannan came as a surprise till the main artiste announced that they would be playing &#8216;Rave Himagiri Kumari&#8217; the swarajati of Syama Sastri. The masterpiece moved with its sheer majesty and transfixed with its incredibly rich tonal hues. In studied contrast entered Andolika. Sharp-edged, snipped phrases contributed to a spare silhouette preceding &#8216;Raga Sudha&#8217; (Tyagaraja). A mood-inducing exposition in Lalitha saw Kanyakumari&#8217;s interpretation leaning towards feel and atmospherics with evocative jarus, while Kannan&#8217;s manipulation of swaras favoured technique over poignancy.&#8216;Hiranmayim&#8217; (Muthuswami Dikshitar) with sangatis layered in two registers carried subtle glints. However, niraval at &#8216;Sangitha Vadya&#8217; glided into kalpanaswaras which progressively displayed instrumental vocabulary as virtuoso dazzle took over, denuding sensitivity. The percussionists had no option but to aid and abet, which they did rather enthusiastically in full measure.The main raga, Natabhairavi was handled with characteristic deftness. During swaraprasthara in &#8216;Sri Valli Devasenapathe&#8217;, yati patterns packed zest into the kuraippu at the rishabha. A thread of taut efficiency ran through the swara episode, tying it to a spectacular build up and finish that excited applause, the same knife-edge precision reflected in Banglaore Arjun Kumar&#8217;s (mridangam) tani with M. Amrit (ganjira). Earlier, &#8216;Nannu Kannathalli&#8217;(Kesari) and &#8216;Vara Narada&#8217; (Vijayasri) did duty as madhyama kala and dhuritha kala fillers respectively. Post-thani, the announcement of rare Annamacharya kritis was followed up with numbers that included a folksy Dwijavanthi.The Priya Sisters&#8217; (Shanmukhapriya and Haripriya) vocal recital drew strength from very traditionally structured programming. Beginning with the Pantuvarali varnam, followed by &#8216;Karunai Seivai&#8217; (Hamsadhwani), they ushered in a note of marked sobriety with &#8216;Maa Pala Velasika&#8217; (Asaveri). Treading softly in Bilahari raga, which was a no-risk venture, &#8216;Paridana Michite&#8217; with kalpanaswara conformed to stereotype. At this juncture, the composition &#8216;Naamam Annadhu&#8217; in Karnaranjani seemed like a fish out of water as it lacked a cohesive structure, with ad-hoc quilted patchwork sangatis. The lack of punch made the composition a suitable candidate for the tail end rather than the middle order. Caution dictated the approach to the Kumudakriya alapana.Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Ardhanarishwaram&#8217; that seems to have catapulted to sudden popularity in the past couple of years was rendered with due respect for swaroopa. In &#8216;Vazhi Maraikkudu&#8217; (Natakurunji) bhava facets were highlighted through relaxed vocalisation. Madhyamavati was mounted on an expansive canvas, a leisurely approach achieving a cohesive picture through a balanced karvai-jaru-bhriga equation.Rewarding moments in kizh kala niraval that stressed the value of gamaka, served as stepping stones to swaraprastara in &#8216;Palinchu Kamakshi.&#8217; It was evident that slowing down the kalapramana of kritis helped the vocalists dwell on sahitya and sangati intricacies, a welcome change from the current youth brigade&#8217;s predominant &#8216;rushing off to catch the boat mail&#8217; tendency. Yet another advantage &#8211; it minimised vocal strain.M.A.Krishnaswamy&#8217;s fluency added consistent lustre, more so during Madhyamavati. Neyveli Skandasubramanian (mridangam) and B. Srisundarkumar (ganjira) displayed their expertise in an absorbing thani.
