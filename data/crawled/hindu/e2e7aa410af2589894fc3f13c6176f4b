VDwaram Narasinga Rao Naidu&#8217;s birth centenary was celebrated in a fitting manner by `Swarajhari&#8217; Sabha of Vijayawada at Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetra Sravana Sadanam. Narasinga Rao Naidu, son of Dwaram Venkatakrishniah Naidu who was the elder brother and guru of legendary Dwaram Venkataswami Naidu, had his training from his father and Venkataswamy Naidu. He worked as violin lecturer and principal of M.R.Government Music College at Vizianagaram for many years and was known as a great guru who treated his scores of disciples with affection.In his heyday Narasinga Rao Naidu accompanied musical celebrities like Parupalli Ramakrishniah Pantulu, GNB, Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna, Chembai Vidyanatha Bhagavatar, T.R.Mahalingam and several others. All his sons and daughters are excellent violinists.Narasingarao Naidu died at the early age of 55. His children Durgaprasada Rao, Satyanarayana, Manorama imbibed their father&#8217;s superb bowing technique and are earning fame in the field of violin. Vidwans Annavarapu Ramaswamy and K.V.Reddy spoke in the function paying rich tributes to the late violin maestro. K.V.Reddy is a prime disciple of Narasingarao Naidu.The meeting was followed by a top class violin concert by Kambhampati Lakshminarayana Sastri of Delhi who retired as a staff artiste of All India Radio Delhi Station and settled down at Delhi. Sastri has a vast experience of accompanying almost all eminents vidwan in the country and toured many countries and received accolades. His vigorous style, traditional approach and fine bowing technique impressed the audience immensely. Sastri played mostly popular items starting with Abhogi varnam followed by `Vatapi&#8217; in Hamsadhvani and `Sobhillu Saptaswara&#8217; (Jaganmohini). The Pancharatna keertana in Sri ragam `Endaro Mahanubhavulu&#8217; was played in the right tempo giving the great composition the dignity it deserves. Energetic and melodious Bilahari followed next.The raga delineation painted a glorious picture of Bilahari and Dwaram Satyanarayana who played the supporting violin also presented an efficient and melodious version of the raga. Lakshminarayana Sastri played Patnam&#8217;s `Paridanamitchite&#8217; (Khanda chapu) brilliantly finishing it with sparkling swara kalpana. After playing `Anadhudanuganu&#8217; in Zingla, Sastri took up Poorvikalyani for the main piece of the concert where he showed his depth of scholarship in all aspects. The kriti was `Paramapavana Rama&#8217; of Ramanathapuram Srinivasa Iyengar. The raga was marked with vigour and serenity catering to the finer sense of the listeners. The keertana also was played with feeling and intensity. Good niraval and swaras also found place in the main item. Dwaram Satyanarayana and Peravali Jayabhasker, both staffers of Akashvani Hyderabad and New Delhi Stations, gave brilliant support to Sastri on violin and mridangam respectively. S. Hanumanta Rao combined well on ghatam with Jayabhasker to present a rousing tani after the main item. The concert came to a close with an Annamayya keertana and a tillana.
