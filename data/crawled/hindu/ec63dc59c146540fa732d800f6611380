VAs a part of its weekly music concerts, Nada Bharathi featured a violin solo by Mangalampalli Surya Deepthi, an artiste of All India Radio, Hyderabad. Disciple of the late Kotipalli Prakash Rao from Rajahmundry, Surya Deepthi is also a seasoned violi\u000anist with rich knowledge and experience which was reflected in the day&#8217;s concert.  He enthralled the rasikas with his high-quality music blended with devotional touch.The concert was dedicated to the guruparampara, and the day&#8217;s significance was Utarrayana and Dakshinayana Sandhi kalam. Surya Deepthi also explained every ragam and the gist of every krithi he rendered, making the concert interesting as well as educative. He began his recital with Dikshitar&#8217;sSri Gananadam Bhajeriin Esamanohari of Deekshitar.He took the Mohana varnamNinnukoriin five kala gathis, something which is rarely displayed. His laya was good and made the varnam more appealing. Narayanee was neatly elaborated with good feel, and played Thyagaraja&#8217;sRama Neeve Ganawith brisk swaram. Ahiri was taken next and Syama Sastry&#8217;sMaayammaflowed soothingly from his hands.Nasika Bhushani, which is a rare ragam, was bravely attempted for a neat and brief ragam forBramarambike.The main attraction was a detailed display of Panthuvarali, where he brought the nuances of the raga with Hindustani sancharas. Thyagaraja&#8217;s Shivaradhana  with speedy swaram was good. Surya Deepthi concluded his recital with a couple of melodious Sai bhajans, followed byManasa Sanchare Reof Sadasiva Brahmendra andNahi Nahiin Madhuvanthi.On the whole, Surya Deepthi performed with devotional display, transforming the atmosphere with his mellifluous violin recital.
