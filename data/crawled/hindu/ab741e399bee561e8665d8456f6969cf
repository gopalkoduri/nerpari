VCarnatic music may have become the vehicle for pyrotechnics as far as some virtuoso musicians are concerned, and it may be the stepping stone towards world fame for others who experiment with fusion.But for large numbers of people, it remains an expression of devotion. So it is with the many cultural organisations across the Capital run mostly by South Indians, who revel in both the melody and the mood of the thousands of traditional compositions bequeathed to posterity by the great vaggeyakaras or composers of Carnatic music. And just as temples modelled on those of Tamil Nadu and Kerala come up in different parts of the city, cultural organisations too flourish, often attached to the temples or at least finding there a ready audience and a venue to host concerts.Community participationThe recent Vasanta Navaratri festival that concluded on Ram Navami day was an occasion for many such Carnatic music enthusiasts to combine their musical tastes with devotion. The Vasundhara Enclave Sarveswara Samaj, not a very old organisation of the city, celebrated the occasion with a week of special pujas to the Goddess, followed by group recitation of the Lalita Sahasranamam (thousand names of the Divine Mother). This daily exercise attracted the participation of over 100 women of the neighbourhood.One of the highlights of the festival was a concert of devotional songs on Lord Ram by Vasantha Krishnan and Lalitha Anand. They were accompanied by Arvind Bharati, a child artiste, on the violin, and by K. Sreeram on the mridangam.The festival took place at Vasundhara Enclave's Sri Sankatahara Ganapathy Temple that was consecrated in April 2005.Bottom Template Starts
