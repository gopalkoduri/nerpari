VC. SURESH KUMARWhat is "Saturday night fever" to many westerners and their  music lovers is the `Guruvar Mandal' for Hindustani music lovers at Hyderabad.Hyderabadis can have a different night fever soaked in good music every Thursday. Sharply  at 9 p.m. every Thursday a regular group of musicians from Hyderabad meet at a house in the small by lane of Badichowdi  near Sultan bazaar. The unique part of this congregation is the participants and the listeners are all musicians and performers in their own right . The most important aspect of these concerts is that elders and senior artistes mingle with the new and young artistes and perform together. Even an amateur too can participate . You just need to be  a vocalist or instrumentalist,  to join the group and perform. It also gives ample opportunity to the youngsters to imbibe the nuances of Hindustani classical form from the seniors.Guruvar mandal as the name goes, meets   every Thursday, and this concept was started way back in 1954. The Guruvar mandal celebrated its golden  jubilee  this year. It was started by a group of individuals &#151;    Bhaskar Rao  Udgirkar,  Shanker Daspremi, Vajendra Ashrit,  Vasudeva Rao Lasinkar,  U. Govind Rao and Ramesh Hyderabadkar, to promote talent and  exchange knowledge on Hindustani classical music.Senior and well-known artistes like Pandit Jasraj too performed here. Many visiting artistes from other States  too perform if they are around in the city on Thursdays.Continuing the traditionSquatting in Indian style, the concerts start by 9 p.m. with a tea break at 10 p.m, and conclude by 11 p.m. This tradition of Guruvar mandal is now being aptly continued by senior artistes of repute like  U. Govind Rao, .Satish Khasikar and  Ramesh Hyderabadkar. Tabla exponent and a very popular teacher  Gajender Shewalker has recommended and started introducing his students to these night concerts to tone up their musical instincts and also enable them to listen to the performances of the seniors .Are you a `musicaholic'? Then don't miss the `Guruvar Mandal'.Address: C/o  Ramesh Hyderabadkar, Advocate, lane adjacent to Sultan bazaar Police station, Bade chowdi, Hyderabad.Bottom Template Starts
