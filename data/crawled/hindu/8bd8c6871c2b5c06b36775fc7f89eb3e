V`Old is gold' was a programme, held at Kalabharathi, to delightfully bring back sweet memories of the haunting melodies from some old Telugu and Hindi movies.It was a thoughtful event conceived and executed by the members of the cultural association of the medical and para-medical staff of Prema Hospital, founded by the philanthropic orthopaedician, Dr. S.V. Adinarayana Rao.It was also very gratifying that the personnel of the ever-busy medical profession could take some time off not only to organise but also to participate to enlighten the public about the good effects of harmonious music.The repertoire for the evening included melodies likeDhadadam DhadadamfromJeevitham,Oho-Oho PavuramafromManchi Manasulu,Payanamaye priyatamafromLaila Majnu,Kalavaramaaye madilofromPaathaala Bhairavi,AkaasaveedhilofromMalleeswari,Andame AanandamfromBratuku Teruvu,Kudi EdamaithefromDevadas,O Duniyake RakhwalefromBaiju Bavra,Khoya Khoya Chand, Dheerese Aajare, Aayega Aayega, Soja Rajakumari, Bholere papi haraand many more.The rendering of the privately recorded songs,ChallagaaliloandPaatapaaduma(Rajeswara Rao) by the director of the Prema Hospitals, Dr. Murali Krishna,Thotalo naa raajuandJorumeedunnavuby Dr. Syamala Devi,Aayega AayegaandDheerese Aajareby Dr. Mukunda Kumari were a special attraction. Guest singers like Dr. J.L. Nair, his daughter Rithu, Dr. N. Kiran, and professional singers like V. Rama Rao and Abid Khan also regaled the audience.The orchestra that added to the grandeur was conducted by reputed music director Bandaru Chittibabu who also played the harmonium. His son Abbayi on tabla, Ramesh on keyboard, Pradip on guitar and Prasad on mridangam lent good support.On the whole, it left an impression of being an exultant sojourn of great music directors and singers like Ashwathaama, Pendyala, Saluru Rajeswara Rao, Ghantalasa, Adinarayana Rao, Leela, Suseela, Jikki and the likes of the Telugu cinema and K.L. Saigal, Naushad, Shankar-Jaikishan, Rajesh Roshan, Latha, Md. Rafi, Noorjahan, and Asha Bhonsle from the Bollywood.A.R.S.Bottom Template Starts
