VThere are some musicians who impress by their sheer humility and humble presentation.  Sattur Sisters Bhuvana Rajagopal and Lalitha Santhanam fall under this category. Their approach is traditional and sincere.  The two ragas they shared in detail for Sri Ranjani Sabha were Ramamanohari and Keeravani. The former was interpreted by Bhuvana who sketched the  raga with smooth glides and engaging akaras. &#8216;Mathangi sri raja rajeswari&#8217; of Dikshitar and the swarakalpana at &#8216;Vama marga priyahari sankari sarweswari&#8217; went on decorous lines with a few swaras landing on &#8216;sarweswari.&#8217;Lalitha&#8217;s expansion of Kiravani bore the traditional stamp. Yet one could not help feeling that  she could have impressed a little more on the sensitive aspects of the raga hovering on karvais. The famous &#8216;Kalikiyunde gada&#8217; and the niraval on &#8216;Baguga sriraghu&#8217; unfurled in the right proportion without any excesses. After the posse of initial swaras, a few more sets centring on &#8216;sa&#8217; were added with quick exchanges between the sisters and Bhuvana concluded the exercise with a well aligned korvai.Hemalatha on the violin added a little extra ornament to Keeravani providing the missing melodious phrases. Her intuitive responses to swaras and ragas need no special mention as Hemalatha is adept at accompanying duos.B. Sivaraman was the lone gentleman in the female group, energetic in keeping the rhythm. His &#8216;tani&#8217; would have been more impressive had his beats were a little more sharp and delicate. &#8216;Sri Sanakra Guruvaram&#8217; in Nagaswarali (Maha Vaidyanantha Sivan), &#8216;Narasimha mamava&#8217; in Arabi (Swati Thirunal), &#8216;Samayamide&#8217; in Behag (Patnam Subramania Iyer) were some of the space fillers.
