The concert, organised by Dharani Society, Kochi, enthralled the audience and had them asking for more.  Crispalaapanas, a well-packed thaniyavarthanam and popular light numbers created an invigorating musical evening.The sonorous timbre of his violin  revealed the power ofnadafor the swaras of `Vathapiganapathim bhajeham.'Dramatic effectAlternate and joint bowing technique for the high notes heightened the dramatic effect. The essay on gandhara and key phrases painted a beautiful picture of Vachaspati raga and the Navaratri keertana of Swati Tirunal `Pahijagatjanani' ensued. `Raramainti' in Asaveri changed the mood to a more sober one. Interspersing his performance with anecdotes, he captivated his audience. There was not a single dull moment in the concert.What rocked the audience was `Raghuvamshasudhambudhi' in Kathakuthoohala raga. The chittaswaras were played at the end.  He gave a choice of three ragas to the audience, who chose Shanmukhapriya. `Vallinayakane,' a kriti by Harikesanalloor Muthayya Bhagavathar, was played.
