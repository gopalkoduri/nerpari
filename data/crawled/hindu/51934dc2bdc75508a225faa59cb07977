VHARISH BALPerforming as a duo has been in vogue in Carnatic music. There is a melodious synthesis of tempo and rhythm and yet each singer maintains the individuality of his style. It is this fusion that makes this genre of performers click. They might show variations in calibre, yet are known as one. Malladi brothers, the latest in this line, performed for Rasikapriya in Kochi.Impressive musicAn intricatevarnamof Lalgudi Jayaraman in Asaveri was presented in medium tempo. The Ghana ragaArabhiwas embellished with  long phrases ofkalpanaswarasby Sreeramprasad. `Nadasudha rasam bilanu,' the Tyagaraja kriti set to Roopaka tala,  was rendered with necessary modulations, and even these were aesthetically synchronized. Khamas, which usually gets a brief treatment, received a detailed elaboration.`Shadananena,' a rare Dikshithar composition in the raga, ensued. Thevakra sancharaswere sung with utmost precision in the slow tempo. An elaboration of Kalyani, focussing chiefly on the upper octave, displayed the purity of the raga in Ravikumar'salaapana. One sees a strict aptitude for grammar in Ravikumar's singing.Sreeramprasad with his pliable voice has a morelakshya-based approach that captures the emotional richness in compositions.T.H. Subramaniam on the violin chose to follow up thealapanaswith just the main phrases and his Kalyani was delectable as he reproduced the key phrases.Melodic appealWith its melodic appeal `Saraseeruhanabhamudaram' in Desakshi raga composed by Swati Tirunal and `Lalithe mam' in Yadukulakamboji mesmerised the listeners.K.V. Prasad's sonorous tenor of the mridangom stood out. Thripunithura Radhakrishnan was on the ghatom. `Agati velala,' an Annamacharya composition in Revathi and `Broohi mukundethi' in Kurinji were well received.A Kabir bhajan `Beet gaye din' had couplets inspired from `Balastawat kreedasaktah' of Bhaja Govindam.The Utsavasampradaya kriti `Shobane' and a high pacedsangatifilled Sindhubhairavi piece `Chandrasekhara Eesha Gowreesha' brought the concert to a close.Bottom Template Starts
