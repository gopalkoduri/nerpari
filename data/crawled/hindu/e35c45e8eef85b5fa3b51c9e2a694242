VThe acoustics played spoilsport from the beginning. The opening number, &#8220;Chalamu seyave,&#8221; Valaji varnam of Lalgudi Jayaraman, was impeded by muffled noises from the audio system, so much so that Geetha had to suspend singing for a while.After frantic activities the volume and reception were set in order and she resumed with &#8217;Vinayaka ninnu vina&#8217; in Hamsadhwani. The kalapanswaras here and after the niraval at &#8216;Allanadu sowmithri&#8217; in &#8220;Kantajoodumi&#8221; (Vachaspati) were well strung. Geetha opened up for the alapana of Hindolam to be followed by &#8220;Garuda gamana.&#8221; Mohanam and &#8220;Ra ra rajeeva lochana rama,&#8221; a favourite of MLV was the centre piece. Geetha had taken care to meld the swara chain with captivating jandai proyagas which was another speciality of MLV.True, the raga essays had all the basic components of an alapana such as karvai, akaras, glides and brigas. But since all of them move more tangentially than towards the core, the impact was diluted. Geetha should internalise the music and execute her expressions with greater stress, emphasis and focus.The vocalist&#8217;s influence definitely reflects on the violinist; M.A. Krishnaswami provided raga and swara fare in the same vein but with a little more stress on Mohanam alapana. For novelty, Geetha Rajashekar had engaged the tabla by R. Venkatasubramanian in the place of mridangam. It did not quite jell. It should, however, be mentioned that Venkatasubramanian created a brilliant impact by overcoming the limitations with supportive roles from H. Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam and A.S.Krishnan on the morsing. The tani avartanam led by Venkatasubramanian was indeed a delight with the perfect integration of lilting rhythmic patterns of the tabla with the mnemonics of ghatam and morsing.The concluding part had just one more reminder of MLV through &#8220;Muralidhara gopala&#8221; in Maund. A selection,   with ragas and kritis close to the heart of  MLV, would have made  her rasikas happier.
