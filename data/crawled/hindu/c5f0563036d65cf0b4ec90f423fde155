VCarnatic &#151;  Layopasana &#151;  Rohan Krishnamurthy &#151;  percussion.ROHAN KRISHNAMURTHY, a teenage mridangam player from the U.S. began his training under Damodharan Srinivasan, and had his talent further honed by Guruvayoor Dorai.Besides being a performer, he has also an innovative mind that conceptualised a new design for the mridangam. His style of playing is reminiscent of the late mridangam vidwan C. S. Murugaboopathy. Rohan's introduction of the importance of rhythm in South Indian music and the predominant role of the mridangam in this sphere, are well exemplified.His tani avartanam for the Adi talam with imaginative permutations and combinations in the different nadais, the flawless beats, meetus, chappus, aria chappus etc. played with appreciable clarity and the crowning rhythmic finale, has the seal of quality. Rohan is a natural and is bound to go far in his chosen art form of percussion.Carnatica (CAR CD 1068) &#151;  Carnatic Harmony &#151;  Tyagaraja's Pancharatna kritis &#151;  Palakkad Sreeram &#151;  Rs. 150.It is no exaggeration to describe the Pancharatna kritis of Tyagaraja in ragas Nattai, Gowla, Arabhi, Varali and Sri as incandescent gems that have in no small measure given character and flavour, form and soul, aesthetics and meditativeness to carnatic music inspiring millions to become connoisseurs and also for youth to pursue the art with commitment and passion. The orchestral presentation of these songs by Palakkad Sreeram is a commendable effort with the artiste employing the multi-track recording to display his prowess in percussion keyboard and flute. The kriti patantaram has a traditional bearing that is conducive to enjoyable, entertaining listening, and the wield of the baton spells harmony. &#151;S.P.Sea Records(28143050,www.searecords.org)  has released a set of five CDs containing Sanskrit mantras for specific concepts such as Health, Wealth, Willpower, Intelligence and Mental Peace and Peace and Prosperity.
