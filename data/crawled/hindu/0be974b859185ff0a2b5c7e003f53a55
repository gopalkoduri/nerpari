VPragati, a premier cultural outfit of Orissa, celebrated `Baisakhi sandhya' on the occasion of the Bengali New Year with a music and dance programme.The performance began with a dance by the child artistes of Pragati who put up a rousing show with folk and modern dance recitals. This was followed by songs by well-known singers from Kolkata &#151;  Poulami Ghosh-Dastidar and Indranil Ray.The singers regaled the audience with Bengali numbers, some of which were a befitting tribute to the `Poila Baisakh'. Before the cultural programme got underway at the amphitheatre of Ekamra Haat Sudhanshu Marik, Udayan Bose and G.N. Banerjee extended a hearty welcome to the audience and the artistes on the occasion of the traditional Bengali New Year.Odissi SandhyaThis was yet another attempt at establishing the classicality of Odissi music as the third stream after Hindustani and Carnatic.Pandit Gopal Chandra Panda took a step further in this regard when he wroteOdissi Raga Ratnavaleein Hindi.The book, released on the occasion of `Odissi sandhya' at Jayadev Bhawan, has compositions in coreragasand traditionalragasof Odissi music. Pandit Panda says that this book, now available to non-Oriya readers, would help bring forth the hidden treasures of Odissi music, which, he asserts, has a totally different set ofragasandtalasbacked by ancientshashtras(scriptures).The evening had a Odissi vocal recital by Sangeeta Panda, daughter of Pandit Panda and she was accompanied by Guru Banamali Moharana on the mardala, a native Odissi percussion instrument. It was followed by a Odissi instrumental concert.Suramani Ramesh Chandra Das played the violin with Bijay Barik accompanying him on the mardala.Interestingly, both the vocal and instrumental recitals were termed `classical' having been composed in typical Odissiragas.BIBHUTI MISHRABottom Template Starts
