VNada Bharati featured Chandrabhanu in their marathon concert series, last week. Held at Swathi Hall, D.D. Colony, the concert displayed her strength in the grammar. She was accompanied by K. Rajan on violin and P. Srinivasa Gopalan on mridangam. The \u000arepertoire was quite varied fromKedaragowla varnam Viriboniin Misra Jhempe talam to the last devotional number of Annamayya.Gifted with mellifluous voice Chandrabhanu presented a Nata compositionSwaminatha paripalayamaamand did swarakalpana at the lineParipalayamam.Eti Yochanaof Thyagaraja that came later was a fast number and created space for a raga essay &#8212; Lalitha, for Shyama Sastry&#8217;s,Nanubrova Lalitha. The exposition was neat. This was set in Misra chapu.Eevasudha Neevanti Daivamuin Sahana, Thyagaraja&#8217;sKovuri Panchartna Kirtana, was then presented with good expression.Shanmukhapriyawas taken up and evolved cautiously.Saravanabhavaof Papanasam Shivan figured in this and was packed with a breezy swarakalpana. After a brief Arunachala Nadham, in Saranga, she went for the major melody of the concert. Khambhoji, for an aptly chosen O Rangasai. She spread this over  in three octaves, adding freshness to each of the phrases. Thyagaraja&#8217;sO Ranga Sayeecarried the melodic lilt of the raga essay. The nereval at the lineBhuloka Vaikunthaman apt place for Sahitya prasthara, was impressive. She revealed rich manodharma in the swaraprasthara part. Rajan&#8217;s violin support in this and also in other numbers she sang went a long way in enhancing the general appeal of the concert.Chandrabhanu concluded her concert withGaruda Gamanain Hindolam a composition of Annamayya and Lalgudi tillana in Desh.
