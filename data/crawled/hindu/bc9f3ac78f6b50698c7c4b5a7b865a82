VRavindra Yavagal has organised a musical evening in memory of his father Ramachandra Yavagal. Ravindra Yavagal is one of India's most admired tabla players and lives in Bangalore. He is heard regularly on the concert stage, and on radio and television. Yavagal Sr. was no professional musician, but was a great supporter of music. "He loved music, and had picked up the tabla all by himself. He would go out of his way to encourage young musicians, especially children who showed interest in learning the art," says Ravindra Yavagal.The Yavagals lived in Hubli then, and when the young Ravindra showed promise, Ramachandra Yavagal moved to Dharwad to make sure his son grew up in the right musical atmosphere. "He was a railway cabinman in Hubli, but gave up his job and set up a small shop in Dharwad," recalls Yavagal.Ravindra Yavagal learnt the tabla from Pandit Seshagiri Hanagal, and has accompanied India's most celebrated names. He is also known for his brilliant solo performances. He is on the staff of All India Radio, Bangalore. His regret is that by the time he was 16 and started accompanying great artistes such as Basavaraj Rajguru, his father was no more. "It is difficult for me to talk about him without sounding sentimental," says Yavagal, "but I must say this festival is a grateful remembrance."He used to hold the memorial concerts in Dharwad when he lived there. For some years after he came to Bangalore, he was not able to do much organising."I revived the memorial concert five years ago, and it is now an annual event," says Yavagal. This year's concert features a tabla solo by Bhadwaj Kulkarni, bansuri by Akash S. (both child artistes), vocal by Kalpana Sumanth and sarod by Pandit Rajeev Taranath. Pandit Rajeev Taranath, the renowned sarod player who is the disciple of the legendary Ali Akbar Khan is also going to be felicitated on the occasion.Entry for this concert on Saturday, June 4, at Canara Union, Malleswaram, 5 p.m. is free.
