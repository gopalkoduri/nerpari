Auditorium of the Rasika Ranjana Sabha, Tiruchi, recently. It was a sweet blend of the commanding voice of the senior and the resonant voice of the junior throughout the concert. They were accompanied by Pudukkottai Ambikaprasad on the violin and Sumesh Narayanan on the mridangam. The violin support of Ambikaprasad and the percussion of young Sumesh Narayanan were pleasing and strong.Pleasant voiceIn the &#8216;Eppadi Padinaro' programme jointly presented by R.R. Sabha and Sri Krishna Sweets on the next day, Prasanna Venkataraman, entertained the listeners with his melodious music for over two hours. He was ably supported by Bombay V.
