VA rendezvous of veteran musicians resulted in a concert that sparkled with melody, style and aesthetics. The concert by O.S. Thyagarajan was held in memoriam of G.N. Swami, a mridangam artiste from Thripunithura.Thygarajan opened his concert with &#8216;Raramaintirada,&#8217; a popular Asaveri kriti instead of a conventional varnam or Ganesha sthuthi. His essay of Kalyani portrayed the beauty of the raga in the upper mid-range. In the Khanda chapu kriti &#8216;Ammaravamma,&#8217; the vocalist gave myriad expressions to the sahitya through a niraval on &#8216;thamarasadala nethrudu.&#8217; The tempo was engaging and the kalapramana neat and precise. Right phrasing and starts made the kalpanaswaras a treat to the ears.T.H. Subramaniam evoked the melody of the raga in the swara and alapana phase on his violin. K.V. Prasad unobtrusively followed the vocalist  on the mridangam whilst embellishing the compositions with his own phrases of brilliance.The rare raga Vardhani found rendition through &#8216;Manasa manasa,&#8217; which was warmly appreciated by the audience. The Tyagaraja composition in Dhenuka &#8211; &#8216;Teliyalerurama&#8217; &#8211; brought out the emotional content in the lyrics.Thyagarajan&#8217;s  elaboration of Mohanam was aesthetically supported  by  Subramaniam.  The latter&#8217;s takes on the raga  were short and yet he wove long phrases tunefully to create that lasting impact.The taniavarthanam saw  Prasad  V. S. Purushothaman (ganjira) show their expertise.  &#8216;Pahiramadoota&#8217; in Vasanthavarali, concluded the concert which was organised by G.N. Swami Trust at Kalikotta Palace, Thripunithura.
