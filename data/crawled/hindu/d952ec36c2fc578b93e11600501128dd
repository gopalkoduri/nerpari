VCarnatic ClassicalCharsur digital work stationSikkil Gurucharan2 CDS CDW 124D (Price Rs. 375)Gurucharan, the young vocalist who occupies a popular slot in the Carnatic concert circuit, is a disciple of Vaigal Gnanaskandan who belongs to the enviable fold of Semmangudi R. Srinivasa Iyer.The album unfolds with a varnam in Reetigowla composed by Sikkil sisters. "Deva deva" in Mayamalavagowla with vibrant neraval and swara passages establish a welcome "Melaprapthi." The violinist Nagai Sriram's replies are equally sweet and spicy.Tyagaraja's only kriti "Vinata Suta" in Jayantasena, a derivative of Kharaharapriya describing the imposing spectacle of the Lord on Garuda, is sung with harmony adhering perhaps to the paatantaram of D.K.Jayaraman. In the comprehensive alapana of Sahana, Gurucharan exhibits a mature approach to underline the rakti swaroopa of the melody. Vivadhi ragas are anathema to some musicians, but the artiste's rendition of "Edayya Gati," Koteeswara Iyer's Chalanata kriti is sung with confidence and concentration on the Shatshruti Rishabham and Shatshruti Dhaivatam.Pertinent neravalSwati Tirunal's "Rama Rama Guna Seema" in a leisurely kalapramanam and clear expression, is garnished with pertinent neraval and kalpanaswaras.Whenever Tiruvarur Bhaktavatsalam is at the helm of the percussion department, the rasika is assured of a rhythmic interlude with technical perfection and lively imagination.  His tani avartanam with experienced ghatam player Vaikom Gopalakrishnan is of riveting rhythm quality.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
