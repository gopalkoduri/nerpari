VGeetha Krishnamurthy presented a veena recital at an event jointly organised by Visakha Music and Visakha Music and Dance Academy at Kalabharathi on last Thursday. A disciple of A. Chittibabu, she honed her skills under the expert tutelage of Nedunur\u000ai, D. Seshachari and T. Venkataraman. Geetha has performed all over the country and abroad.Expertly accompanied on mridangam by Akashavani Vijayawada staffer M.L.N. Raju and N. Rajaram on ghatam, she got off to an absorbing start playingNinne Bhajana(nata). Dexterously evolving glimpses of the traditional styles of exposition of Carnatic music on veena in a leisurely tempo, with vocal fervour in particular, Geetha rendered a refreshing recital.The items she mainly negotiated in detail with ragam, neravu and swaram wereSubramanyenaof Dikshitar (Suddha dhanyasi) andNidhichaala Sukhamaof Tyagaraja (Kalyani). Her expression of manodharma by way of raga delineation, neravu and swaram went spontaneously in tune with the Sangeetha Sahityabhavas embedded in the compositions discerningly. The scholarly thani executed by M.L.N. Raju with Rajaram on ghatam as the concluding part of Kalyani was thrilling.
