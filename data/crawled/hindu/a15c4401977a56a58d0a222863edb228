Abhijit gave a fine start to the concert with impressive rendition of aKhyalin Poorya Dhnasri (Pantuvarali in Carnatic Music) and a Purandaradas keertana in rag Bibhas which is almost similar to Bowli of Carnatic music.

He and Adharsh provided fine support to Abhijit Shenoy.The next one to follow was an engaging Kuchipudi dance by S.M. Yasaswini of Vijayawada. Perfect poise and great abhinayam skill were her assets.
