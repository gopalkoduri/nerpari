VPeriasamy Thooran's &#8216;Aingaranai' (Kedaram-Adi) helped Sankari Krishnan settle down for the evening at Srinivasa Sastri Hall, Luz, this past Saturday. Her concert was presented under the auspices of Nadopasana.The Sherthalai brothers Sivakumar (violin) and Ananthakrishnan (mridangam) were her accompanists.After the December season, the raga Dhanyasi has started surfacing often in many platforms and this concert was not an exception. Sankari's elaboration of Dhanyasi started on a promising note. Though many phrases went a begging in the lower octave, Sankari focussed more on the mid and higher octaves. Sivakumar's reply was laid back and sedate.&#8216;Paradevata Bruhadkuchamba' (Dikshitar-Adi) saw Sankari traverse the kalpanaswaras in two speeds. She sang &#8216;Anupama Gunambudhi' (Atana-Kanda Chapu-Tyagaraja) with its natural lilt.NoteworthyAnanthakrishnan's accompanying pattern for this song was noteworthy. The Saveri raga delineation was prosaic and at times, Sankari went off key. Sivakumar treated it better. The sruti aspect was however perfect during the kriti phase (&#8216;Sri Rajagopala', Dikshitar-Adi) with the niraval in the pallavi line and swaras. Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar's Devamanohari kriti &#8216;Neekela' (Adi) was delivered at jet speed. Sankari came out unscathed negotiating the chittaswaram cleverly. Sankarabharanam, the evening's main raga, passed muster. The raga essay could have been less hurried.Sivakumar's approach was a trifle slower with elongated sancharas. However, Sankari's improved interpretation of the raga in the slow speed of the kalpanaswara segment (&#8216;Sarojadalanetri', Adi-Syama Sastry) made up for it.Ananthakrishnan who played with zest throughout the concert, excelled in the tani segment too.
