VThe artistes have rich resonating voices, more sonorous in the mandra sthayi than in the tara sthayi. Resilient voices reached the higher pitches with ease, though a few promptings were necessary before they could sustain for longer lengths.  Manodharma flows incessantly neither restrained by the intricacies of a phrase , nor fettered by the pace they chose for elaborations.&#8220;Cheludani Ne Kori&#8221; (Varna - Ananda Bhairavi - Ammachatram Kannuswamy Pillai) comprised deep gamakas compactly delivered with the necessary vigour. Sprightly delivery of both the Mukthayiswaras and Ethugadesawaras warmed up the beginning.Vasudevachar&#8217;s Sanskrit lyrics in &#8220;Vande Anisham Aham&#8221; (Hamsadhwani) could have been more meaningful, had the artistes distinctly split the compound word with appropriate stress accents. In the present instance, it sounded &#8211; &#8220;Vande Nisham Maham&#8221;, carrying altogether a different meaning.Attractive scholarly articulations in an overall medium pace (Madhyama Kala) predominantly exposed the relevant raagachaayas than convincingly eliciting raagabhaavas. This also limited the scope for exposing the swara bhaavas and subtle gamakas.Observe &#8220;Ramaamanohari&#8221; (Raamapriya - Venkatamukhi- &#8220;Maathangi Shri Rajarajeshwari&#8221; - Muthuswamy Dikshitar). Alapana demanded gentle evolvement with pronounced involvement, for a truly inspiring impact. This would have amply nourished the expected Bhakti and Karuna rasas: relatively a slower tempo would have rendered the whole presentation grandly sublime.On the other hand, the artistes established their thorough scholarship and versatile competence in Gowrimanohari (raga-thana&#8211;pallavi- &#8220;Vande Shambhum Umapathim&#8221;): imagination and creativity knowing no bounds. In these stages, the inspired violinist proved his mettle.&#8220;Endundi Vedalithivo&#8221; (Darbar-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Mari Mari Vachuna&#8221; (Kamboji-Vasudevacharya- featuring all the expected ingredients delivered in good taste, including a thaniyavarthana) and &#8220;Thyagaraja Paalaya&#8221; (Gawla -Muthuswamy Dikshitar) were some of the other highlights.Malini with her accompanists presented Katha Kaalakshepa featuring Thyagaraja Sangeetha Darpana, in tribute to the great composer. The resourceful artiste convincingly narrated the milestones in the life of Thyagaraja, and conveyed the message in simple language and musical mattu, accessible to even the layman.The artiste has in her repertoire many compositions of Thyagaraja and Purandaradasa, always ready to meet her intuitive needs. Contextually, she sang selected passages from Papanasham Shivan&#8217;s &#8220;Parathpara Parameshwara&#8221; (Vachaspathi); Purandaradasa&#8217;s &#8220;Dayamado Ranga Dayamado&#8221; and &#8220;Taarakka Bindige&#8221;; Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Maamava Raghurama&#8221; (Saranga), &#8220;Shambho Mahadeva&#8221; (Panthuvarali) and Tansen&#8217;s &#8220;Gaana Vidya Bahu Katin&#8221; and so on.
