VA THREE-day music festival dedicated to Swati Tirunal, which was organised by Nadopasana at Irinjalakuda recently, was enriched by the concerts of senior artistes. On the first day, Malladi Suribabu, who is the torch-bearer of Volettis' music tradition, and his brother, Narayanasarma, started with the pleasant `Chalamela' (Nattakurinji) with its interwovensahithyafor chittaswarams and followed it with `Gajananayutham' (Chakravakham), `Narasimha' (Aarabhi) and `Sree Sukhra' (Paras), the navagraha kriti for that day.Panthuvarali was elaborated by the duo and they sang `Aparamabhakthi entho' with the right intonation.They meticulously added thecharanamreferring to Bharatha, the presiding deity of the place. Thealaapanaandswaraprastharathat centred around madhyama infused serenity and echoed Voletti'sbhani.A breezy `VandesadaPadmanabham' (Navarasakannada) was followed by the main item `Dasarathe nee rinamu' (Thodi). A hurriedly sung ragam, tanam, pallavi in Begada, Annamacharya kritis `Mayamohamu' (Jog), `Nandakarananda' (Rageswari) and a Surdas bhajan `Hey Govinda' (Desh) comprised the post-thani phase. M.A. Sundaresan, with his mellifluous Parur style of bowing, was outstanding on the violin, especially his rendition of Panthuvarali and Thodi.M.L.N. Raju (mridangam) and Udupi Sreedhar (ghatam) accompanied the artistes and played a timely thani for the Thodi piece.Rich legacyS. Kasim and S. Babu, who are the inheritors of the rich legacy of the legendary Sheikh Chinna Moulana, regaled the audience with their Gayaki style of rendition on the second day. Kasim and Babu synchronized well, creating an aura of sublime music. An elaborated, bhava-laden `Raamapriya' (Mathangi)alaapanaby Kasim and a well-structured, unhurried Kamboji (Sree Raghukula)alaapanaby Babu was ample proof of their talent and training. Rarely-heard Swati kritis `Kamalajasya' (Dasavathararaagamalika) and `Telugu Javali Ithusaahasa' (Saindhavi), `Dudukugala' (Goula), `Mamavasada' (Kanada), `Evarunnaru' (Malavasri) were included and the timing of Kamboji was praiseworthy.S. Angusamy and Senthilkumar with their subdued rhythmic patterns on the thavil made the concert more enjoyable. A Kabirdas bhajan (`Hamanako-Misrakamas') and an alluring `Sindhubhairavi' (Bhaja bhaja) constituted the last leg of the concert.Fitting finaleNaadasangamam, a musical ensemble of Carnatic and indigenous instruments, coordinated by P. Nandakumar, including only Swati kritis, gave a majestic and fitting finale to the festival.`Jaya jaya' (Manirangu), `Deva devakalayami' (Mayamalavagoula), `Kripayapalaya' (Charukesi), `Deva deva jagadeeswara' (Poorvikalyani), `Poonthen' (Ananthabhairavi) and `Thillana' were some of the kritis played.Edappally Ajithkumar, Viju S. Anand, Manjoor Ranjith (violin), Ram Mohan (mridangam), Manjoor Unnikrishnan (ghatam), Govindaprasad (mukharsankh), Nandakumar (edakka), Udayan Namboodiri (chenda) and Arundeva Warrier (madhalam) were the young artistes who participated.The Mayamalavagoula and Poorvikalyani pieces were amazing and the violinist tagged the latter with ragamalika swaras  -   kaapi, Sindhubhairavi, Samudrapriya, Bihak, Neelambari, Ranjini, Desh, Madhyamavathi  -   which was followed by a scintillating thaniavarthanam, where the chenda and the madhalam played some phrases fromkeli.Music by devotees was held on all the three days and the last day also witnessed a Pancharathna keertanam by music teachers and students of Sree Sankara University, Kalady.A.
