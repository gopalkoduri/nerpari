VIt was not easy to come across  a studious and sincere student, mentioned veteran veena player and guru Padmavathy Ananthagopalan. Malavika, in that context was a rare find, she added, referring to her disciple, who came under her care at the tender \u000aage of three.The occasion was the Guru-Sishya Parampara Series organised by Hamsadhwani. And Malavika&#8217;s vocal recital  that evening justified her guru&#8217;s words as she performed with commendable confidence and adherence to tradition.Malavika&#8217;s vocal skill has the range suitable both for kaarvai and brigas. It was therefore surprising that   she restricted her resonant kaarvais in the main Keeravani raga alapana while the brigas were rolling in quick succession. The singer must bear in mind that  a raga is best portrayed   through reposeful phrases than  swirling brigas.The central piece of Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi in Keeravani in Adi talam two kalai was phrased as &#8220;Dasaratha tanayuni maravaku manasa dinamu kshanamu.&#8217; The trikalam part preceded by exhaustive niraval showed  Malavika&#8217;s control over raga and tala. The kalpanaswaras were aesthetically structured in ragamalika fashion  &#8212; Valaji, Hamsanadam, Kedaram and Ranjani. Rahul on the violin complemented Malavika with discernment but followed her style in raga alapana delivering Keeravani sans feel.Earlier, Malavika presented a vivacious Begada appended with Dikshitar&#8217;s oeuvre &#8220;Tyagaraja namasthe.&#8221; Her swara forays in Begada and earlier in Hamsadhwani (&#8216;Varana mukhava&#8217;) were  smart and inspiring.  Thanjavur Subramanian and Pudukottai Ramachandran  supported the young vocalist and violinist with soft and sensitive percussion. The thani avartanam was a sober treat.Sishya Shankar Venkatraman made  guru V. Subramaniam proud.  With his robust voice, open throated articulation  and the characteristic stamp of &#8216;Semmangudi&#8217; style, Shankar kept the audience engaged for more than two hours.  An artist&#8217;s imagination could be gauged only through his raga expositions and kalpanaswara. Shankar&#8217;s  sketch of Poorvikalyani (Moyyar thadam poygai pukku&#8217;- Thiruvachagam) and Sankarabharanam (Enthuku beddala) shone with  raga bhava. The niraval point &#8216;Veda sasthra tatvarthamu telisi&#8217; was presented with wisdom appended with a compact wrap up of swaras.Shankar packed his concert with a number of kritis like &#8216;Gaja vadana&#8217; (Sriranjani) after the opening Kalyani varnam, &#8216;Tyagaraja palaya sumam&#8217; (Gowla), &#8216;Guruleka etu vanti&#8217; (Gowrimanohari with a pleasing alapana and a taut niraval swaras at &#8216;tatva bodana jesi kapadu&#8217;), &#8216;Kanu kontini&#8217; (Bilahari) and &#8216;Sarasa sama dana&#8217;(Kapinarayani). A viruttam in ragamalika (Saveri, Kedaragowla, Behag and Shanmukhapriya) followed by &#8216;Andavane unnai nambinen&#8217; in Shanmukhapriya and &#8216;Parulanna mata&#8217; in Kapi came as closing pieces.Nitpicking? Well, Shankar is no doubt an energetic and enthusiastic vocalist showing considerable promise; however, a careful eye on sruti and attention on fixing swaras in the right slots will smoothen the rough edges.Venkatraman was blessed with two seasoned accompanists &#8212; R.K. Sriramkumar on the violin and Manoj Siva on the mridangam. Sriramkumar reflected the moods and expressions of the singer in right measure adding a few  soulful touches or strident strokes here and there. Manoj was definitive in his rhythmic support in an unobtrusive manner.The gurus Padmavathy and Subramaniam were honoured by Hamsadhwani.
