VThe light music bonanza organised by the Engineering and Technology Association of Annamalai University at the Kamaraj Memorial Hall recently, opened with M. S. Viswanathan's everlasting signature tune, `Vanakkam Pala Murai Sonnaen,' was followed by another of MSV's favourite song, `Pullankuzhal Kodutha ... ' so excellently penned by Kannadasan.The show was a journey to the reverberating MSV hits of the past. The composer recalled how a song took shape on stage in front of the audience on the occasion of Kannadasan birthday and how the incident inspired director K. Balachandar to include a similar sequence in the Kamal-Sridevi hit, `Varumaiyin Niram Sigappu.'Moments of emotion were witnessed when SPB expressed his thankfulness to MSV for the opportunities that the composer had offered him and also when MSV himself touched upon his Kannadasan days.T. K. Ramamurthy's job was more that of a conductor of the orchestra. S. N. surendar chipped in with the ever-popular song, `Nilavae Ennidam Nerungathae.'His mellifluous rendition of the song interpolated with his own awesome improvisations was a treat for the music lovers in the hall.Ananthu and Kovai Murali were the other singers. But the indisputable highlight of the evening was SPB's presentation of `Kadavul Amaithu Vaitha Maedai ... 'The song that had excellent mimicry bits done in the original by Sadhan and Saibaba, both of whom are no more, were amazingly replicated by SPB. With commendable orchestral support, the show proved a worthwhile effort.Bottom Template Starts
