VRadha Namboodiri&#8217;s vocal recital under the aegis of Nadabrahmagana Sabha in Vanaprastha, Vadavalli, offered a treat of legitimate and subdued music despite a dwindled audience. She commenced with &#8216;Sami Daya&#8217; varnam in Kedaragowla wh\u000aich gave the kutcheri a bright takeoff.The following &#8216;Sree Maha Ganapathim&#8217; (Atana) garnished with sarvalaghu swaras was arresting.The Semmangudi style was obviously evident in her interpretation of &#8216;Deva Deva Kalayamite&#8217; (Mayamalavagowlai) presented with bhava-rich sangatis revealing her manodharma. &#8216;Nee Madi Challaga&#8217; in Anandabhairavi was a soothing rendition with rich imagination.Her raga delineations of Kalyani for the kriti, &#8216;Pankajalochana&#8217; and Thodi (the main raga of the concert) for the kriti, &#8216;Sree Krishnam Bhaja Maanasa,&#8217; though sketched with flourish and solemnity, her effortless musical lines and delicate expressions were marred by swara slippages in the upper reaches. &#8216;Vinarada&#8217; (Devagandhari) and &#8216;Bhajare Re Maanasa&#8217; (Abheri) were ear-worthy. She wound up her musical agenda with a vibrant Thillana.Subbaraman&#8217;s solo versions of Kalyani and Thodi, were marked by a striking combination of sensitivity and style to etch a crisp consummation of the framework of the ragas. Parameswaran (mridangam) gave energetic support throughout.
