VThe composers in the West\u000athroughout history have\u000abeen dictated to by the\u000aChurch or the State.\u000aSome more than others.\u000aBeethoven was an exception.\u000aHe said "Bishops and Dukes\u000awill come but there will be\u000aone Beethoven." To this the\u000apatrons had no answer and\u000aleft him alone. Others were\u000aless lucky.SchubertThe composer Schubert was a simple and innocent\u000achild of nature. But he also could not avoid the\u000apolicing of the notorious Matternich. Schubert had a\u000acircle of friends known as Scubertiads who wrote\u000apoems and had regular outings. The words became\u000athe lyric of Schubert's marvellous series of songs.\u000aMatternich did not approve of this group. Schubert\u000awas always afraid of being sent to jail.Bela BartokBela Bartok, who used Hungarian folk music in his\u000aworks, had to flee to America where though Menuhin\u000atried to help him by giving commissions, he died in\u000apoverty. Shostakovich, Bartok and Prokofiev are all\u000agreat masters of 20th Century music blending tradition\u000awith innovation. It was a pity they never enjoyed\u000afreedom. Their creativity was chained.PalestrinaPalestrina (1525-1594) saved music itself from dictatorship\u000afrom the Church. It was the age when there was\u000aonly vocal music and the church was the only outlet. In\u000a1562 the Church decided that there would be no music\u000ain sacred places and called for The Council of Trent to\u000apass the law. Palestrina, a great mass composer, stepped\u000ain and asked for one chance to prove that music for the\u000aChurch could be holy. He composed the famous mass\u000aMissa Papae Marcelli. The pope was satisfied and lifted\u000athe ban. If Palestrina had failed the history of music\u000awould have been different.William ByrdThe English composer William Byrd (I543-1623) faced\u000aanother kind of problem. He was a Roman Catholic in\u000athe age of Queen Elizabeth I, a staunch Protestant. Byrd\u000ahad to go hiding and always faced the fear of death. He\u000acomposed masses for four and five voices because he\u000acould not get more musicians who were all afraid to\u000aannoy the authority of Church which had dictated that\u000aonly Protestant music would be permitted.MozartMozart was a victim of dissent which\u000achanged his life. At that time he was attached\u000ato the Salzburg court whose Archbishop Collorado\u000aargued with Mozart over a musical\u000apoint and upset his travel plans. Mozart did\u000anot relent and he was literally kicked out by\u000aCollorado who will go down in history as the\u000aman who changed Mozart's life. Mozart\u000amoved to Vienna where he became the\u000aworld's first freelance composer. But he was\u000aalways in poverty and ill health haunted him.\u000aHad he stayed in Salzburg he would have\u000aenjoyed many comforts of the Kappelmeister\u000aand may not have died so early.Johann Sebastian BachThe composer Johann Sebastian Bach was working for the court of Weimer\u000awhen just before his term was over he received a tempting offer from the court\u000aof Kothen whose Duke was very musical. But Weimer refused to release Bach\u000aand when he fought for his rights sent him to jail for a month. But after that he\u000awent to Kothen where he composed some exquisite instrumental music like\u000athe violin concertos.Dimitri ShostakovichBut no other composer has faced the problem of dissent like the Soviet composer Dimitri Shostakovich under Stalin. Shostakovich was not alone; there were Prokofiev, Kachaturian, Miaskowski. Some of the Russian composers like Stravinsky and cellist Rostrapovich took asylum in the West. But Shostakovich stayed back. Everything was going fine until he composed the opera &#8220;Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk district&#8221;. The opera was very well received and its praise reached Stalin who decided to go and see the opera. It was a disaster. Halfway through it he walked out in rage. The opera was immediately withdrawn and Shostakovich began to fear for his life. He was then composing the Fourth Symphony and decided to hide it. It was never performed until 1962 when conductor Ormandy gave its world premiere in America. Instead of the Fourth, Shostakovich composed and premiered his famous Fifth symphony which he described as a Soviet artist's reaction to just criticism. Stalin liked that, but put his culture hound Zadanov on Shostakovich's track. From that time Shostakovich was driven to Paranoia. He had several nervous breakdowns and was not himself until Stalin died. But Zadanov continued to frustrate him. He composed his symphony number 14 based on poems of death and his eighth quartet on the war victims. Prokofiev who had fled came back to face the wrath of Zadanov. He composed a lot of propaganda music but there was also the glorious Fifth symphony and works for cello. Ironically he died on the same day as Stalin.
