VG. SWAMINATHANMala Ramadorai's  pleasing Hindustani vocal recital for Hamsadhwani transported the audience to a world of melody laced with myriad emotions.The leisurely tempo, the passionate lyrics 'Dukh na laage naina tarasa bina thore ram' in raag Madhukauns carried a sweet-sad tenor. The slight inflections, finer embellishments with akaras and swirls, magnetic hold outs, smooth glides, magnificent flights and phrases that created a lump in the throat flowed in full measure. Mala enjoyed strong support with delicacy in the harmonium by Ravindra Katoti and with majestic but controlled beats by Uday Karpur on the tabla.Later, Mala took up Abogi, well known to Carnatic listeners too with her Madhya and Dhurit segments of `Charana dari aayore more par daya kar' which was a neat blend of devotion and zeal. A kajri came next set in the light semi classical mode. A chota khayal followed by a Mira Bhajan in raag Hamir was the penultimate piece of Mala. She concluded her scintillating concert with a song on the harbinger of chaitra season relating to the longing for the Lord's arrival.The concert stood out for the way Mala Ramadorai balanced both lyric and music. Truly a soothing experience.Bottom Template Starts
