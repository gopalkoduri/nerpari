VOverwhelming beauty in both the forms of ragas and kirtanas pervaded the performance of the ensemble of H.K. Venkataraman (violin), Aswin Anand (veena) and G. Ravikiran (flute) in the Krishna Gana Sabha Gokulashtami music series. While briskness mark\u000aed their exposition, there was also a sense of calmness. With impeccable coordination the gayaka style predominated. The deep impression the recital made was reflective of the sense of intimacy among artists and the ragas and kirtanas they presented. The values and creativity had definite aesthetic overtones. The heightened resonance of veena, violin and flute was a product of intense musical motivation.The alapana of Begada by Venkataraman at the beginning of the concert was appealing as the raga&#8217;s beauteous shades flowed with manodharma and expression in harmonious precision. As the vinyasa progressed each sanchara served its purpose in the picturisation of depth and crispness. The three vidwans shed elegance and radiance on the kirtana &#8216;Abhimana&#8217; of Patnam Subramania Iyer. The sangatis, as they played, provided a sample of their mature status.It was the turn of Aswin Anand to paint the contours of Varali. He collected the raga sancharas in sheaves and made it look sumptuous. With consummate command over the frets, he roved over the Varali terrain with rapidity and spiralling passages. The song was &#8216;Seshachala Nayakam.&#8217; The interpretation of the kriti with sedulous attention paid to bring out the delicacy of the sahitya was decorous.Ravikiran&#8217;s contribution was an elaborate Kalyani. The pattern was fanciful in design and dexterous in display inviting rapt attention. It was peppered with spicy sancharas at every stage of its development. The three laid before the rasikas a sportive and lilting play of the kirtana, &#8216;Pankaja Lochana.&#8217; To cap the kutcheri was Khambodi (&#8216;O, Rangasayee&#8217;).The response from the mridangam vidwan, R.Ramesh and the ghatam artist A.S.Shankar was enthusiastic. They patterned their style and content to lay emphasis on lively percussive support. The tekas and pharans had bounce and skilled manipulation.
