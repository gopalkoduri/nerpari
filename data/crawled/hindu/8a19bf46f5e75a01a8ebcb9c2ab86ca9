VThe Gopika Geetham which forms part of the Srimad Bhagavatham comprises verses portraying the anguish of the Gopis on being separated from Krishna.Purely devotional in content without shringara rasa, these verses are said to bring prosperity and peace when recited with bhakti.RPG enterprises have released a compact disc of the Gopika Geetham (Srimad Bhagavatham) and Gopijana Ahladham (Narayaneeyam) sung by Kalyani Padmanabhan.The vocalisation is neat and the veteran tunesmith V. Dakshinamurthi has chosen classical Carnatic ragas for setting the tunes.First recorded by HMVThe Gopika Geetham was first recorded by HMV in the late 1960s using the voice of M.L. Vasanthakumari.It is a coincidence that the current disc and the earlier recording both commence the Gopika Geetham with Yadukula Khambhodi.The other ragas which are employed in the disc under review are Bhairavi, Nattakkurinji, Manolayam, Amritavarshini, Mohanam, Atana, Kapi and Madyamavati.The percussion support is in tune with the devotional nature of the lyrics and is non aggressive.Verses from the Narayaneeyam constituting the Gopijana Ahladham are set to Behag, Hamsanadam and Sindhubhairavi.Kalyani has rendered the verses with a lot of involvement and the result is pleasing.These verses reflect the joyous mood of the Gopis when Krishna reappears in their midst.Songs penned by Ambika Padmanabhan (Nandakumara-Bagesri) and by Chowalloor Krishan Kutty are &#8216;Omana Thinkal Kidavo,' Kharaharapriya, &#8216;Akasa Neelimayil,' Hindolam and &#8216;Ee Thirunadayil,' Kanada bring the disc to a finish.This disc would be a welcome addition to rasikas who have a fondness for devotional music.And these songs would be apt in the month of Margazhi.
