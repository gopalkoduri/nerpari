VBhushani Kalyanaraman, whose non-strident and graceful communication skills have won her wide acclaim, demonstrated that she was quite at home in all the numbers she handled, at the vocal concert held under the aegis of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore.Bhushany's presentation of the majestic &#8216;Viribhoni' varnam in Bhairavi in two speeds was gripping.&#8216;Varavallabha' in Hamsadhwani that followed next was rendered with suitable kalpanaswaras. Her Andholika raga alapana for the kriti, &#8216;Ragasudharasa' was an earnest effort featuring suitable karvais.Melodic presentationThe Khambodi raga vinyasam for the kriti, &#8216;Kailasanathane Samrakshithoham' was melodious but the discords in the kalpanaswaras following the niraval had a jarring effect.The raga delineation of Kalyani for the kriti, &#8216;Enthuko Nee Manasu' was well-executed with rich phrases and intricate patterns to portray the beauty of the raga.Hemamalini's violin essays at the raga sketches and swara sallies were in tune with the vocalist's style.Ranganathan (mridangam) and Sethuraman (ganjira) provided good percussion support with a vibrant thani.
