VGARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMBrindha Manickavachagam sounds most unlike  the young singers one comes across these days because this girl  -   she is under 17 years of age  -   does not pretend to sing like a mature artiste. She may one day want to scale the heights reached by great masters. But there was  enough indication of Brindha's innate ability to avoid the straitjacket in music.For the duration of 90 minutes during the series of concerts being held under the aegis of Krishna Gana Sabha to commemorate Gokulashtami, Brindha made singing sound so natural, so easy and relaxing.If not for the soft melody that her not so loud voice gave off unfailingly, you could have accused this current disciple of Dr. Manjula Sriram, and (in her early upbringing in the Gulf) a former student of D.J.Balakrishna, of not exerting herself enough on the stage.These were this writer's first impressions on listening to the opening Bahudari varnam, composed by Lalgudi Jayaraman, and also the last, after Brindha tackled  Desh.Notable among the kritis featured in the interregnum was a rare Tyagaraja kriti `Raghunandana Rama Rajamohana,' in an equally uncommon ragam &#151;  Suddha Desi, said to be derived from raga Natabhairavi.Rare kritiThe GNB composition ``Jaganmohanakrishna," was again a rarely heard piece, but in the rather well known raga Kadhanakutuhalam.``Siddhivinayakam seyveham," the Muthaiah Bhagavatar kriti in Mohanakalyani and Papanasam Sivan's `Venkataramana' in Latangi, received a highly refined treatment from the youngster and sounded very fresh despite being heard in ever so many concerts.The main piece in ragam Hanumatodi, `Koluvamaragada,' was perhaps the lone exception to the otherwise simple but highly appealing choice of compositions for the afternoon.The exposition of the raga, which appeared partly as if intended to measure up to some distant yardstick, also sounded a little hurried, perhaps for want of time.Master Parur Anantakrishnan, grandson of the distinguished M. S. Anantaraman, played a supporting role on the violin, with some sparks of the legendary touch.Master Sumesh Narayanan, disciple of the illustrious Tiruvarur Bhaktavatsalam, was likewise impressive on the mridangam.Bottom Template Starts
