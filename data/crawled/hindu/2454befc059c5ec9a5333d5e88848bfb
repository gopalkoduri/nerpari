VA flute concert by L.V. Mukund, accompanied by J.K. Sridhar (violin), R. Adamya (mridanga) and Ranganatha Chakravarthy (ghata), was part of a series organised recently by MES Kalavedi, Bangalore, in connection with the Vidyasagara Prof. M.P.L. Sastry Birth Centenary Celebrations.A vibrant start was made with &#8220;Chalamela&#8221;, the aditala varna in Natakurinji, and Dikshithar's &#8220;Mahaganapathim Manasa Smarami&#8221; in Natta, to which were appended a few avarthanas of kalpana swaras. A brisk rendition of the Thyagaraja Pancharatna krithi in Sri raga, &#8220;Endaro Mahanubhavulu&#8221; followed. &#8220;Darini&#8221;, the imposing Thyagaraja composition in Shuddhasaveri raga and aditala was presented next, embellished with well-proportioned and finely crafted kalpana swaras that also included some gathi variations.Swathi Thirunal's &#8220;Deva Deva Kalayami&#8221; in Mayamalavagoula raga, incorporating a neraval and plentiful kalpana swaras at &#8220;Jatharupa Nibhachela&#8221;, and Thyagaraja's &#8220;Bagayanayya&#8221; in Chandrajyothi raga, prefaced a comprehensive alapana of Karaharapriya. While pivotal notes such as the rishabha and dhaivatha were emphasised effectively, the sweet essence of the raga was drawn out in a series of mellifluous phrases perfectly aligned to shruthi. &#8220;Chakkani Rajamargamulundaga&#8221; in aditala was suffixed with kalpana swaras in two speeds that also included a stint of diminishing tala cycles ending at the dhaivatha, underscored by excellent support from the accompanying artistes.The concert, which maintained a lively tempo throughout, was an exposition of enormous technical prowess and exceptional aesthetic awareness. However, structurally the performance would have benefited from an in-depth elaboration of at least one additional raga, and by the inclusion of a detailed neraval in the main item.***Suswaralaya College of Music and Nadasurabhi Cultural Association jointly hosted a veena concert by Shubha Santhosh, accompanied by M.R. Sainath (mridanga) and Dayananda Mohithe (ghata).The meticulously planned recital commenced with a two-speed rendition of the Natakurinji varna in adi tala, testimony to a firm and dexterous touch. Dikshithar's &#8220;Sree Mahaganapathiravathu Mam&#8221; in Goula raga and misra chapu tala, played in a mellow tempo that highlighted the grandeur of the composition, was succeeded by a swift &#8220;Varanarada&#8221; in Vijayashri. A soft and reposeful expansion of Kedaragoula prefixed the Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Venuganaloluni&#8221; in rupaka tala. Impeccable artistry was revealed in the succeeding elaboration of Simhendramadhyamam, and in the well-constructed neraval and kalpana swaras that were appended to &#8220;Ninne Nammithi&#8221; set to misra chapu thala.&#8220;Tharakka Bindige&#8221; in Tilang and &#8220;Meevalla Gunadosha&#8221; in Kapi provided the lilting interludes before the main raga of the evening, Nattakurinji. A fairly exhaustive alapana, suffused with raga bhava, was followed by a ragamalika tana which also included demonstrations of the gaja, chakra, ashva and mandooka varieties. The pallavi, beginning &#8220;Nattaikurinji Embar&#8221;, set to aditala, was rendered with the usual rhythmic variations. The kalpana swaras also included ragamalika swaras beginning with Natakurinji, Natta and Kurinji, with interesting clusters based on the raga nomenclatures, such as Vasantha, Bhairavi and Vasanthabhairavi, and Mohanam, Kalyani and Mohanakalyani. The wholehearted involvement of the percussionists culminated in a tani avarthana that combined expertise with a sense of proportion. The performance drew to a close with a bracing thillana in Hamsanandi.
