VWhat matters in a concert is the list of songs that a musician chooses to play or sing.The process of good selection takes it beyond sheer competence to sublimate exposition, for it is well recognised that the great monumental edifices of serene vaggeyakaras hold the key to the exceeding excellence of a recital.The chitraveena concert of Ravikiran, for Sri Krishna Gana Sabha, in spite of his masterly proficiency, could not transcend the popular level. Nalinakanti, Ghanta, Kannada or Chandrajyoti could not achieve what a Khambodi, Bhairavi or Sankarabharanam can confer.The programme started with &#8216;Manavyala&#8217; (Nalinakanti) appropriately to anchor the pace of the performance. There was a welcome restrained method in the presentation of the lilting kirtana with soft furnishings of swaras. The Ghanta item &#8216;Sri Kamalambike Avaava&#8217; (a Navavarna piece) was soothing.The following two songs were &#8216;Inta Kante&#8217; in Kannada and &#8216;Bhaagayanayya&#8217; (Chadrajyoti). The merit was the lucid presentation. Technical competence heightened their resonance. The raga sancharas of Kannada before the song were distinctly artistic. These items were followed by a Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi in Sarasangi.The violinist Akkarai Subbulakshmi was Ravi Kiran&#8217;s alter ego and so there was not much difference between their manodharma mapping. Her playing technique matched that of Ravikiran.Vellore Ramabhadran was a picture of gentleness both in presence and play. He had the ghatam support in Tiruchi Murali. The vocal support by Anahita Ravindran was the fifth wheel in the team. The concert was part of the Veena Foundation&#8217;s series.The force that sustained Sudha Ragunathan&#8217;s reputation &#8211; her prolific briga-laden exposition &#8211; seemed to be deserting her if her recital in the Sri Krishna Gana Sabha Gokulastami series was any indication.In its absence the creative urge lacked inspirational influence. The response it drew from the audience was different from what she had been accustomed to.The kutcheri was marked by an accommodative effort to make do with her present situation.The raga framework of Dhanyasi lacked intensity and depth though her career experience helped her to preserve the swaroopa in tact. The sancharas outlined appeared to be prosaic lacking in her characteristic spectacular sweep. But still the simple straightforward image of Dhanyasi was relishable to those who like values of composure.The kirtana &#8216;Meena Lochana&#8217; of Syama Sastri was rendered in the same mood as raga handling, plain in effect and free from any profundity.If the programme gained any respectability it was due to her music springing from parampara stock. This aspect was to be noticed in the earlier item, &#8216;Mokshamugalada&#8217; (Saramati), &#8216;Narada Muni&#8217; (Pantuvarali &#8211; tisra nadai) and later in the expansive coverage of Kharaharapriya (&#8216;Chakkani Raja Margamu&#8217;).The sancharas of Kharaharapriya were negotiated and steered with tonal evenness. She mapped at the raga&#8217;s essentialities without any impetuous rush. Of course, she had a good vision of the shades of Kharaharapriya, but could not translate them into luminous picturisation. The arresting aspects of raga development were transitory.In this environment, the contribution of accompanists, Embar Kannan (violin), J.Vaidyanathan (Mridangam) and R.Raman (morsing) could not be expected to rise to great heights.Embar Kannan, in the solo versions of ragas Dhanyasi and Kharaharapriya maintained their forms, not their class. It was not a convincing presentation of his real capacity. There were no appealing highlights in the raga imageries.J.Vaidyanathan, the percussion artist, normally adept in emphatic support to kirtanas, was comparatively subdued and unenthusiastic. His play was flat.Fitting finaleThe Veena Navaratri festival organised by Veena Foundation, New Delhi, in association with Narada Gana Sabha, Sri Krishna Gana Sabha and Sri Parthasarathy Swamy Sabha, concluded with a melodious veena recital by veteran Vidya Shankar at the Narada Gana Sabha.In her speech at the valedictory function, the vainika congratulated Raghurama Iyer, founder of Veena Foundation, on organising a festival of such stature every year all over the country. She offered her prayers by presenting Syama Sastri&#8217;s mangala kriti on the veena, &#8220;invoking the goddess of wealth, prowess and knowledge.&#8221;Supported by disciples Bhagyalakshmi Suresh and Rajeswari Anand, she vocally rendered &#8216;Sankari Sankari&#8217; in raga Kalyani. As a finale she sang a composition in Madhyamavati wherein Sastri addresses the Goddess as &#8216;Samagana-Sruti-Sammodini.&#8217;
