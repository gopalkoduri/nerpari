VThe Sahana raga alapana followed by the emotional kirtana &#8216;Giripai Nelakonna&#8217; formed the crest jewel of the performance of Lalgudi G.J.R.Krishnan and his sister Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi in the Krishna Gana Sabha Gokulastami series.More than the expertise of their exposition the message they conveyed was very pertinent.Creative excellence cannot be achieved without the strong foundation of spartan discipline and sadhakam.In many concerts today the musician&#8217;s meddling intelligence mis-shapes the beauteous forms of such monumental kirtanas.The atmosphere Krishnan created in the Sahana suite was salubrious.The sancharas had smooth pathways and the modulations in the violin tone made the play soft and flexible. The raga was marked by spiralling passages and flowing lines. He was very particular not to offend the guidelines of good music. In this respect he lent distinction to his lineage.In the rendering of kirtanas, the emphasis on quality was the most striking feature. What his performing ability has gained over the years is his responsiveness to the finest intimations of the songs of Tyagaraja and Dikshitar, played by him with perfect coordination with Vijayalakshmi.The interpretation of &#8216;Dinamani Vamsa&#8217; (Harikhambodi) and &#8216;Tyagaraja Yoga Vaibhavam&#8217; was ascetic and looked like a diligent effort to fathom the musical values embedded in them.Vijayalakshmi&#8217;s role was subsidiary, but in her solo session of Pantuvarali alapana (&#8216;Narada Muni Vedalina&#8217;) her manodharma vision was well imparted in the sanchara depiction.Bangalore Praveen (mridangam) and V.Suresh (ghatam) embossed their laya support with care, competence and restraint.
