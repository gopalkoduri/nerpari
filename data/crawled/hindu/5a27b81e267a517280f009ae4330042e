VDeepest melody rests in his voice purveyed through subtle, flashy expressions. It was rather difficult to say which was a more satisfactory experience &#8212; the vocalist&#8217;s adventurous inclination or the felicitous way he brought the weight of his vidwat to his performance. One thing was evident. His music would reach great heights if, instead of allowing his well-endowed voice to lead him, he made musical sensitivity dictate to his voice.Enhanced by a splash of bravura passages in the alapanas of Panthuvarali and Kedaragowla, the kutcheri took on a breezy complexion. The vinyasa, as rendered by him, was spontaneous with plenitude of sancharas. It carried a favourable factor in that his majestic voice imparted much refinement of tonal expression, but it was his exhibitionism that trivialised values. Though sporting a coquettish swing, there was dignity of Carnatic music. Long karvais, loops, gorgeous sancharas formed the raga edifice. His creativity was well matured by intensity of feeling with a skilful control of form.His training under a towering vidwan helped him enormously in the rendering of kirtanas. His interpretation of &#8216;Sri Ranganayakam&#8217; (Nayaki) and &#8216;Saragunapalimpa&#8217; (Kedaragowla) clearly brought out the radiance of the composition. The spiritual excellence of the Nayaki kirtana was unfolded stressing its specific beauties. The shades of the raga in the song were precisely and compellingly revealed.The Kedaragowla kirtana with its structural cohesiveness and chittaswaram was presented with passionate gracefulness. One significant feature noticeable was full-steam articulation both in ragas and kirtanas. But there was lack of clarity in the enunciation of sahityas. If he desires to proclaim his individual identity he has to move away from the shadow of Seshagopalan. The violin accompanist Shertalai Sivakumar had enough competence to follow the vocalist&#8217;s lies, but aesthetic-wise not convincing. The percussionists M. S. Varadan and particularly the morsing player N. Sundar, helped generously by over-amplification for them, almost drowned Kasturi Rangan&#8217;s recital. The thani was over-stretched.
