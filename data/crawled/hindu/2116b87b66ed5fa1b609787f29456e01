VIn the recital of Subhiksha Rangarajan in the junior slot at the Krishna Gana Sabha Gokulashtami series, there were two aspects that stood out &#8212; technical competence and azhutham in articulation that are essential for a youngster to move to rec\u000aognisable progress.The programme was built around two major kirtanas &#8212; &#8216;O! Jagadamba&#8217; (Ananda Bhairavi) and &#8216;Manasu Swadeena&#8217; (Sankarabharanam). The other items were: &#8216;Sambho Mahadeva&#8217; (Bowli) &#8216;Dunmargachara&#8217; (Ranjani) and &#8216;Maaley Manivanna&#8217; (Kuntalavarali).In the handling of raga alapanas of Ananda Bhairavi and Sankarabharanam, one significant feature was that Subhiksha never resorted to crooning to feign mellowness. On the other hand full-throated negotiation of sancharas had smooth ascent and descent.The two kirtanas stood out for musical values.Her aesthetic instincts helped her observe self-control. The precise way in which she built the sancharas around moorchana centres enhanced their appeal.Subhiksha&#8217;s interpretative method in rendering songs clearly brought out their radiance. The performance was a testimony to her ability and quality of training. She was supported by violinist Sudha R.S. Iyer who was also well equipped. The mridangam artist was Uzhavoor Babu, and ghatam was by H. Prasanna.
