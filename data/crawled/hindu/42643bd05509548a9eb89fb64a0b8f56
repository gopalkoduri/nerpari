VThe 2008 Grammy award for the best historical album went to &#8216;The Live Wire: Woody Guthrie in Performance 1949.&#8217; This was a restoration of a live recording of the famous American folk singer, Woody Guthrie. It brought Grammies to those inv\u000aolved in restoring the old recording: Nora Guthrie and Jorge Arevalo Mateus, who were the compilation producers, and Jamie Howarth, Kevin Short, Steve Rosenthal and Warren Russell Smith, the mastering engineers. This writer spoke to two of the award winners to get the story of that restoration.The 1950s were not a good time to have working class sympathies in the U.S. -- it was the McCarthy Era. But this did not deter Woody Guthrie from making social inequalities the focus of his lyrics. Although Guthrie is perhaps best known for his song &#8216;This land is your land&#8217;, he has also written songs exclusively for children, says Nora Guthrie, Woody&#8217;s daughter, and one of the founders of the Woody Guthrie Archives, in a telephonic interview. &#8220;These songs have been taught in nursery schools in America for the past 40 years. There&#8217;s one that I particularly like. It&#8217;s about kids helping to keep the house clean. It goes &#8216;All work together with a wiggle and a giggle&#8217;.&#8221;How many recordings of Woody&#8217;s are there in the archives? &#8220;Although we have 3,000 unrecorded lyrics of my father&#8217;s, we only have about 150 to 200 recordings. He was a performing artist, not a recording one. My father embraced music to make people aware of their rights. You could call my father&#8217;s songs a soundtrack to the trade union movement in the U.S. Because of his leftist leanings, he was cut out of television and album sales,&#8221; says Nora.&#8220;My father would talk about a social cause, and then sing about it, thus giving the song a background, a context. For example, in one song, he talks about a mining disaster and how employers must ensure the safety of the workers. By singing about events and issues of his time, he unintentionally, perhaps, became a historian of sorts. Many people who visit the archives are students who want to study the Labour movement or the history of mining in America or other social issues, by going through his lyrics.&#8221;Over the past 15 years, Nora has brought out seven albums of her father&#8217;s unrecorded lyrics. Five have been nominated for a Grammy, and two have won. Nora talks about the India connection of the founder of the archives.&#8220;Harold Leventhal, who helped found the archives, was my father&#8217;s friend and music manager. During World War II, Leventhal enlisted in the U.S. Army and was posted to India. There he met Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi. He was greatly impressed by Mahatma Gandhi&#8217;s philosophy of non-violence.&#8221;Leventhal knew sitar maestro Ravi Shankar from his Kolkata days, and had a love for Indian art and literature. He co-produced Tagore&#8217;s &#8216;King of the Dark Chamber&#8217;, and was an ardent fan of Satyajit Ray. &#8220;Leventhal was my mentor,&#8221; says Nora.Nora talks about the Live Wire album, for which she won the 2008 Grammy. &#8220;It&#8217;s appropriately titled &#8220;Live Wire&#8221;, because it is the only live recording of my father&#8217;s, and it was recorded on wire.&#8221; How did she discover it? &#8220;I did not discover it. It was an unauthorised recording by a student called Paul Breverman in 1949. Fifty years later, he willed it to the Guthrie archives, and when he died, the recording was mailed to us. This was in November 2001. Because of 9/11, there were warnings from the postal department not to open packets from unknown senders. There were posters all over New York saying, &#8216;Don&#8217;t open strange packages.&#8217; This parcel messily wrapped in brown paper looked just like the one the poster spoke of. No one at the archives office wanted to touch it. After half an hour of dithering, I decided to open it. We didn&#8217;t even know that wire had ever been used as a recording medium. Since we didn&#8217;t know what to do with it, it remained untouched for another year. Then a friend introduced us to Art Shifrin, a hobbyist who loves this kind of thing. He built a machine to play the wire.&#8221;How difficult was the process of restoration? &#8220;Extremely difficult. Just to get the audio from the wire to the computer took 36 hours.&#8221; What was her first reaction when she heard it? &#8220;I cried because I had known my father only as a sick man. He had been hospitalised because he had Huntington&#8217;s chorea, and when I heard my mother and father talking to each other in the album, I couldn&#8217;t contain myself.&#8221; Although the content in the wire had been transferred on to a computer, much more had to be done. That&#8217;s why the others, who went on to share the Grammy with Nora, had to be roped in. Of course, an algorithm developed by a professor at Cambridge helped.The bootlegged recording of Guthrie that Nora received had been made on a wire spool. A wire spool is different from the reel to reel. While in the case of the reel to reel, we have magnetic data stored on magnetic tape, in the case of the wire spool, we have magnetic data stored on steel wire.Art Shifrin helped transfer the audio content to a computer, but speed was still a problem. So Nora sought the help of Jamie Howarth. Howarth is the founder of Plangent Processes, which has patented Clarity Audio Restoration technology. This uses an algorithm to correct distortions in analog recordings. Howarth talks about his work in a telephonic interview:Would you say that many of the problems of speed variation that you encounter are mainly due to the various mechanical parts of the recording device?Yes, it&#8217;s mainly the mechanical parts - motor bearings, spindles, pulleys that cause speed variations. Also different mechanical components may operate at different speeds. A spindle may rotate at a certain rate. Some other component may rotate at a different rate.What else causes distortions?Take films, for example. The older films were made of acetate, and over time, this breaks down into vinegar. We call this the vinegar syndrome. The films also stretch.What happens because of speed variations?You have what are called &#8216;wow&#8217; and &#8216;flutter.&#8217; When the speed is too slow, you hear a &#8216;wow.&#8217; With greater speed, you hear a flutter.Do you have this kind of wow and flutter also in film?Yes. In fact, in film a very fast flutter is sometimes found.So how do you remove this wow and flutter?At Plangent Processes, we use digital signal processing. Professor Patrick Wolfe of Cambridge University has developed an algorithm for us that helps us remove high frequency inter-modulation distortions. And we can remove the fast flutter in film. I&#8217;ve used this algorithm to restore the audio for Steven Spielberg&#8217;s &#8216;Close Encounters of the Third Kind.&#8217;Are there any problems peculiar to analog recording in the matter of frequency modulation?Yes. In analog recordings, we have speed variations at a higher frequency than flutters. When flutter occurs above a certain frequency, there is a grainy quality to the recording.Can you fix the problems that cassettes might present?We can, but cassettes are more difficult to fix.Howarth has a unique way of tackling the problems he encounters.)When a recording is made, there may be a background noise. For example, if the recording had been made in, say, a cafe there may be the background noise of a refrigerator. Or in some cases, there may be the noise of a fan or an air conditioner. The rhythmic &#8216;whir&#8217; of a fan moves in consonance with the errors in the recording -- it speeds up or slows down in accordance with the errors. So, I use this background noise as a cue to tweak the timing of the recording to make it similar to the original. Once, I fix the rhythmic background noise to make it sound as it must have originally, then I can fix the rest of the recording in a similar manner.Will your methods work for 78 rpm records?If there is a repetitive pattern, yes, we can help.Can you help improve the quality of already digitised material?In some cases. But it is better that we are there at the inception.Were you there for the Guthrie project from the beginning?Sure. I was present at the playback.What were the problems presented by wire recording?It is a fragile medium. The wire is only three thousandths of an inch thick, and because it&#8217;s wire, it was twisted in many places.Who made such wire devices in the past?There used to be a company called Webster in Chicago that made these devices.Sixty years from now, your work will be history. Will posterity be able to access your work then? Is there not some kind of built-in obsolescence in digital formats too?Future generations should be able to access our work, though we all worry about whether the different formats will still be readable. (Digital audio tapes) DAT format tapes are difficult to reproduce even now, only 10 years after they were the industry standard.The restored Guthrie recording was released in 2007, and picked up the Grammy in 2008.
