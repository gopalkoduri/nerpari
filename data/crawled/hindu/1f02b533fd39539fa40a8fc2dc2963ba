VOn the occasion of the 88th  birth anniversary of Guru Anandamurti, the Renaissance Artists and Writers Association (RAWA) and Renaissance Universal (RU), the cultural and intellectual wing of Ananda Marga Pracharak Samgha, organised a symposium-cum-cultural evening in Mumbai this past week. It was based on Prabhat Samgiita (song of dawn) composed and set to tunes by Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar aka Guru Anandamurti. The programme was  held at the P.L. Deshpande Maharashtra Kala Academy.The programme started with an  invocation dance based on Prabhat Samgiita performed by Kumari Namrata. On this occasion, noted vocalist Padmabhushan Prabha Atrre was felicitated for her valuable contribution to the field of classical music.After the felicitation Atrre spoke about RAWA and Guru Anandamurti&#8217;s contribution to music. She said,  &#8220;I am surprised to know that Guru Anandamurti has composed 5018 songs within a short span of time.&#8221;Eminent classical singer Ashwini Bhide Deshpande presented four songs from Prabhat Samgiita &#8212; &#8220;Ankhiya Tumhiko Chahati Hain&#8221; (Hindi), &#8220;Jay Shiva Svayambho Pashupate&#8221; (Sanskrit),  &#8220;Tumi Bhulo Na More&#8221; and &#8220;Oshe Madhurata Makhaya Shyamaraya&#8221; (Bengali).  Anant Joshi (harmonium), Hanumant Rabde (side rhythm), Sandeep Kulkarni (flute) ) and Rishiraj Salvi (tabla) ) accompanied her.  She enthralled the audience with her  melodious voice. A colourful dance drama titled &#8220;Banshi&#8221; was also presented by Sursaptak artistes (Shraoshee Majumdar, Amrita Mukherjee, Aditi Mitra, Alina Mukherjee, Dola Bhatacharya, Komal Sardar and Nivedita Mukherjee).For the uninitiated, Prabhat Samgiita is  a collection of 5018 songs composed in  eight languages including Hindi, Sanskrit ,English, Bengali,  and Urdu.  . Said to be composed in a span of eight years, the songs are essentially  devotional in form and content.
