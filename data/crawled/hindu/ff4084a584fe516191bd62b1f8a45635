VNinnadaasanadheCarnatic classical - various artistesVasantham Vasco - Rs. 80.It is an innovative concept to select songs from the Purandaradasa repertoire and tune them almost exactly in the same mould as Tyagaraja's Pancharatna kritis.   "Sringara" in Bhairavi, "Saranu" in Saurashtram, "Gururaya" in Gowrimanohari and "Jayamangalam" in Saurashtram are the carbon copies of "Chethulara," "Sri Ganapathi," "Gurulekha" and "Pavamana".Shyamala Gopalan, reader (retd.), Annamalai University and V. L. Sudarsan, senior lecturer in violin in the same university, have handled the project with care.The vocalists G. Srikanth, V. L. Sudarsan, Surya Prakash, Shyamala Gopalan, O. S. Thiagarajan and Dr. K. Vageesh have sung with emphasis on the emotional, lyrical and melodic appeal. The instrumental section is in the safe hands of N. Ramani (flute), V. L. Sudarsan (violin), V. L. Narayana/Mudikondan Ramesh (veena), Srimushnam Raja Rao/Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar (mridangam) and Vaikom Gopalakrishnan (ghatam).S. P.Bottom Template Starts
