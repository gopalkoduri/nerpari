VThe Malwa region occupies a plateau in Western Madhya Pradesh remembered also for the Golden Age of the Guptas. Prahlad Tapaniya, the voice of the evening is one of the most forceful and acclaimed voices of Kabir in India who combines singing and explanation of Kabir in the Malwi Folk Style. Recipient of the Sangeet Natak Academy Award, Prahlad has emerged as a rural Rock star with tremendous charisma. Supported by the strong high pitched tenor of his brother Ashok and sons Ajay and Vijay, to the accompaniment of tuneful violin, tambi, kartal and tambur, Prahlad extolled the importance of the original sound which is the Guru, &#8216;Naad Brahma.&#8217; The salutations to the Guru erase the discords  in life. It is the &#8216;atpat&#8217; which removes the &#8216;Khatpat,&#8217; the play on the words brought to light through the explanations accorded by Shabnam Virmani and Dr. Linda.Kabir&#8217;s message of &#8216;unity in diversity&#8217; came out loud and clear. Taking a series of &#8216;pairs of opposites&#8217; Prahlad pointed out the state of clarity and divinity that can be attained by all. It is the same life which is manifest in both the elephant and the ant. It&#8217;s the good deed which is of paramount importance. In the words of Kabir, &#8220;Paanch tatva ka putla manush dharia naam, rang mahal mein ajab shahar mein nirgun sez bichchaii.&#8221;The formless king &#8211; the soul is the metaphor for the body which sees no boundaries. The same formless energy is  aplenty in Nature which needs to be preserved; brought out beautifully in &#8220;Jheeni jheeni bheeni chaderiya.&#8221; It&#8217;s the subtle cloth of subtle colour that  drapes the mystery of the mysterious. &#8216;Agam ka khel.&#8217;The field is the metaphor for the body. There is reference to five senses and 25 sense objects represented by Tamas, Rajas and Satav. However under the keen eye of the Guru it is possible to attain beatific awareness.&#8220;Gyan ka bhoola, Surat ka Chooka, Guru shabad rakhwala, Arre kahe Kabir suno bhai saagho, pohanche guru mukh Pyaara.&#8221;And again, &#8216;Hamara Satguru banya Bhedia&#8230;&#8221;It is the Satguru who is in the know of the divine mysteries, who imparts vision that gets translated into pure consciousness. This image mediates in the process of the humans in search of sources of life and wholeness. And while the process is on, the overpowering flowing melody of Prahlad carried one to ecstasy, combining hope, joy and meaningful celebration of life. Presented by Prakriti Foundation in association with Alliance Francaise, this was a part of the Indian Documentary Film Festival &#8216;One Billion Eyes.&#8217;
