VMadurai Seshagopalan&#8217;s concert for  Sri Parthasarathy Swami  Sabha on Tyagaraja day made it very clear that his motivation was exhibitionism and not exquisiteness. That he was stirred by this impulse in rendering the kirtanas only made it spectacular and not heart-warmingly reverential. The process of his manodharma, both in alapanas and songs, was enveloped in the dazzle of vocal velocity. There was delectable artistry in the alapanas of Vasanta (&#8220;Sitamma Maayamma&#8221;, Mukhari (&#8220;Elaavatara&#8221;) and Kharaharapriya (&#8220;Pakkala Nilapadi&#8221;), but they were destitute of delicacy.Usually the few movements at the start of raga vinyasa carried the true flavour of the ragas, but once the bravura passages came on the scene the beauty of the ragas vaporised. It is rather difficult in Seshagopalan&#8217;s concert to identify which raga was the main item for all of them were over-stretched. Alapana brevity is not a creed with him.In the interpretation of  Tyagaraja&#8217;s songs on an occasion like that, the intrinsic musical values that the saint composer had built into them had to be given more importance than external dressing up by vocal manipulation.None can question Seshagopalan&#8217;s giant-like vidwat. Would it not get enhanced if it was tempered with restraint? All that remained etched in the minds of rasikas were the early prayogas in Mukhari and Kharaharapriya, the former enticingly excellent. It was here that the rare individuality of his pantha was impressive. Later development showed nothing tangible about the poetic form of Mukhari or Vasanta. The presentation of the Mukari song, &#8220;Elaavatara&#8221; was perfunctory.The accompanying dharma of a violinist is to tailor his play to reflect the vocalist&#8217;s predilections. In this art, M. Chandrasekharan is a past-master sewing kirtana sancharas in alapanas while preserving the technique of the vocalist. He lived up to this image in meeting Seshagopalan half way. Only his bowing exuberance added a shade of harshness to the vital passages. Compactly sound, with classical dignity and propriety, his solo versions of the three ragas were expressed in lyrical idioms. There was discernment in the introduction of speedy sancharas.In the whole ensemble the subtle mellifluity of nada came from the percussive wing with K.V. Prasad on the mridangam and T.V.Vasan on the ghatam.Energetic sound patterns vibrated the chords of percussive refinement. It was a tribute to them in the way the two tala vidwans have grasped the inherent values of the tala art in their correct perspective. It served to emphasise that gentle support while accompanying songs was more rewarding than assertive rhythmic rhetoric.
