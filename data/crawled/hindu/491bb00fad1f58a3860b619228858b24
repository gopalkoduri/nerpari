VThe Jayanti (90th) of Harikatha exponent T.S. Balakrishna Sastrigal was celebrated at Rani Seethai Mandram past Sunday afternoon.Welcoming the gathering, his eldest son and technocrat-turned-film director T.S.B.K. Moulee expressed his desire to  collect the recordings of his father&#8217;s from various sources, digitise and make them available for posterity.S.B. Khanthan, Moulee&#8217;s brother and  chartered accountant turned film director, recalled how Mahaperiyava evinced keen interest in Sastrigal&#8217;s Tyagaraja Ramayanam wherein he had seamlessly sewn select kritis of the saint poet  to unfold the epic.A two-CD MP3 audio pack of Tyagaraja Ramayanam performed live in Bombay for 11 days by TSB along with his brother and vocal support of T.S. Valleesan was released that evening. Excerpts from the CDs were played much to the delight of the crowd. This was followed by engrossing a speech by Sengalipuram Damodara Dikshitar. He waxed eloquent on TSB&#8217;s multi-faceted talent that included in depth knowledge of Sanskrit and many other languages, puranas and classical music.Srivatsa Jayarama Sarma continuing the Krishna Vaibhavam series from where he left off last year drew a lot of references from Tiruppavai and Azhwar&#8217;s pasurams. He penetrated deep into the core of Narayaneeyam bringing out its essential truths.This CD pack produced by Swathi Soft Solutions under its Sanskriti series, priced at Rs.175 is a collector&#8217;s item.
