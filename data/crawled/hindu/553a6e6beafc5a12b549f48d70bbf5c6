VUnified in theme but diverse in form&#8230; that was the crux &#8216;Natyalayavibhati&#8217;, a classical dance presentation conceived by the Kuchipudi dancing couple Raja and Radha Reddy.The piece was the grand finale at the 2005 National Festival of Music and Dance titled Laayalayam in New Delhi, as part of the Reddys&#8217; school, Natya Tarangini&#8217;s Parampara series. Now, that performance has been released as a DVD by Sea Records.The thematic performance features six dancers showcasing the various styles of Indian classical dance &#8212; Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Mohiniyattom, Kathak, Odissi and Manipuri &#8212; to verses from the Natya Sastra and Abhinaya Darpana. Music was by Durga Prasad.The choreography is done in such a way that each artist gets a chance to perform solo before joining together for a riveting nritta finale to the same beat, all the time maintaining her individualistic style.The first to take the stage is Jayaprabha Menon, whose interpretation of chatursam exposes the delicate and graceful movements of the dance from Kerala.One can feast on the sculpturesque poses of Kavita Dwivedi in her Odissi piece in tisram. Manipuri, a dance form that is not as visible as the rest of the styles, finds a graceful representative in Beena Devi.Kausalya Reddy, who chooses misram to depict Kuchipudi, the temple dance from Andhra Pradesh, is a picture of poise and dignity. She is followed by Anuradha Venkatraman, whose crisp Bharatanatyam solo is in contrast to Sharmishta Mukherjee&#8217;s Kathak smooth presentation.The DVD captures the facial expressions and nuances of each dancer, though the camera is slow in catching the footwork of Kausalya at times.However, a brief introduction to the performance, its background and a bio of the dancers would have made a big difference, especially since this is a DVD which many students of dance might like to own. Special features include a speech by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the inauguration.Sea Records; Rs. 1,250.For details, contact Sea Records, 1, Ramachandraier Street, II Floor, T.
