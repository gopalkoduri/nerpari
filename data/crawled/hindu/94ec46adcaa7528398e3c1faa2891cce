VB. RAMADEVISikkil C. Gurucharan, a scion of the family of flautists Neela and Kunjumani, showed great promise during his concert organised by Alapana, Coimbatore, recently.Having been under the tutelage of Vaigal Gnanaskandan, the young artiste proved that when nature and nurture united,  it could produce remarkable results. Gurucharan commenced with the melodious Sree raga varnam, ``Saami Ninne Koriyunnaanu'' by Karur Devudu Iyer and moved on to ``Siddhi Vinayakam Seveham'' in Mohanakalyani by Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar.Dexterous swarasHe decorated the song with tastefully and dexterously woven swaras.  After a moving alapana of Sriranjani, he sang ``Neesaati Deiyvamenduledeni,'' a rare dharuvarnam by Muthuswami Dikshitar in Telugu. Those who were used to Dikshitar's mastery over Sanskrit were treated to this composition that showcased  his mastery over Telugu also. Gurucharan presented this piece in a lively manner, with due respect to  sahitya.``Maamayoorameethileri Vaa'' was an enjoyable number. ``Saaramathi Chandra Sodhari Unnai Sharanadainthen," a song on Varalakshmi by Mangalam Ganapathy in Saramati was equally beautiful.After rendering Tyagaraja's  "Sarasa Samadhaana'' in Kapinarayani briskly,  Gurucharan presented Koteeswara Iyer's ``Mohana Kara Muthukkumara" in Neethimathi and Purandara Dasa's ``Narayana Ninna'' in Suddha Dhanyasi.He chose Tyagaraja's "Dhinamani Vamsa'' in Harikamboji  for vivid elaboration and vindicated himself as a talented singer who believes in meticulous hard work as he sang the alapana, neraval and manodharmam. Towards the end, he sang a few viruthams and popular numbers such as "Idadhupadam Thooki,'' ``Naanamaa Unakku Nanamaa," ``Varugalaamo Aiya'' and concluded his concert with the Meera bhajan, ``Hariguna Gaavath Naachoongi."Nagai R. Sriram's violin was mellifluous and he earned as much applause as Gurucharan did during the alapanas and swaraprastharas. R. Sankaranarayanan on the mridangam and K. V. Gopalakrishnan on the kanjira played with gusto lending full support to the main artiste.Bottom Template Starts
