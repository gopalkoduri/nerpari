VThe young man faced a highly knowledgeable and critical audience.... And what a thrilling revelation was in store for us! Whether he rendered an alapana or kriti in Kharaharapriya, or a pallavi in Simhendra-madhyamam or a swara improvisation in ragamalika, Krishnan showed clearly that as a violin virtuoso he is now almost as good as his father, and perhaps will soon be better. The lucid elaboration of the melodies with a flawless bowing technique, a perfect sense of rhythm, a highly imaginative but sober approach to the swaraprastharams, a deep understanding of the spirit of the music, his father&#8217;s dashing touch, free from all extravagance &#8211; every good quality one could look for was there ...Of course, those early impressions have stood the test of time, and Krishnan has now firmly established his credentials to become Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s worthy successor as a performing artist.Vijayalakshmi too has assimilated her father&#8217;s style rather well. So it isn&#8217;t surprising that when they perform together as a team one hears intriguing echoes of the sparkling and soulful solo violin recitals of their legendary guru.These brilliant violinists need extremely sensitive percussion accompaniment, and that&#8217;s precisely what they got on this occasion from the magic touch of veteran mridangam vidwan T.V.Gopalakrishnan, who was unobtrusively supported by his disciple V. Suresh on the ghatam.We don&#8217;t often see TVG in the role of an accompanist these days, apparently because he&#8217;s  preoccupied with his other concerns as vocalist and dedicated teacher. But whenever he does play the mridangam in the concert hall, he adjusts his style admirably to suit the main performer&#8217;s.In the concert under review, he blended delicate and sonorous percussive sounds skilfully to provide a bright  stream of rhythm which flowed  fluently.It seemed as if in his imagination TVG was accompanying Lalgudi Jayaraman himself and  was a source of great inspiration to the violinists.Their selection of  ragas was extremely tasteful, featuring some lovely ones &#8212; like Denuka and Reetigowlai for crisp rendition,  Sankarabharanam for colourful and detailed exploration and Bhavani for a compact ragam-tanam-pallavi.Long after the  concert was over, their master&#8217;s exquisite composition which came in the end &#8212; a tillana in the raga Maund &#8212; lingered in the listener&#8217;s memory like a bright and beautiful rainbow.
