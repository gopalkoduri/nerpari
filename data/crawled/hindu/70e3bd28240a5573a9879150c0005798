VBhasange Balaga, an organisation dedicated to fine arts, celebrated its second anniversary at Vasudevacharya Bhavana. On this occasion, the organisation run by youngsters setting exemplary trend, honoured veterans, K.V. Murthy (a philanthropist and known art promoter) and S.R. Krishnamurthy (a journalist and senior art critic).Vidhyabhushana captured the audience on this memorable evening. Mysore M. Nagaraj (violin), H.L. Shivashankaraswamy (mridanga) and M.R. Manjunath (ghata) accompanied this accomplished singer of high repute.Well-known to mesmerise the listeners by his sentiment-charged voice, Vidyabhushana swayed the hall thronged to full. In addition, his very approach to the Dasa Sahithya with due stress on the lyrics, transformed the musical experience into a consummated awareness.Further, the singer in consideration to the melodic aspects, carefully abstained himself from superfluous feats. The concert was pleasing and majestic and the listener got the import of the compositions and core of the philosophy embodied therein.&#8220;Palagadalodeya Paalisu&#8221; (Vadiraja), &#8220;Narayana Ninna Nambide&#8221; (Shripadaraja), &#8220;Daasa Daasara Maneya&#8221; (Kanakadasa), &#8220;Sharanara Surabhooja Gururaja&#8221; (Surapurada Anandadasaru) exemplified the above observations reaching pleasant climaxes. Inclusion of such compositions as &#8220;Shiva Shiva Shiva Yanarada&#8221; (Panthuvarali-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Ennadu Ni Kripa&#8221; (Vachaspati-Patnam) and &#8220;Ra Ra Rajivalochana&#8221; (Mohana-Vasudevacharya) took the concert to its conventional completeness.Alapana in Mohana (&#8220;Ra Ra Rajivalochana&#8221;) passed through articulations - methodically drawn and analytically presented, the violinist complementing and equalling the singer at every level with amazing regularity and understanding. The percussionists' tani avarthana was a perfect extension of the pleasant experience the audience hitherto enjoyed.An absence of neraval did not leave any perceptible lacuna, and the swaraprastara aptly harmonised with the overall mood of the lyrics. &#8220;Marulu Madikondeyalle&#8221; (Purandaradasa) and &#8220;Ishtu Dina Ee Vaikunta&#8221; (Kanakadasa) were among other absorbing numbers.
