VK. Gayatri&#8217;s recital was commendable for the artistic direction she gave to her exposition. The sweetness of her Sahana alapana and kriti &#8216;Chittam Irangadadu&#8217; was testimony to that.The phrasings moved effortlessly along the octaves indicating that she was quite conversant with the characteristic nuances of Sahana. The song was rendered with great feeling. The other major raga she sang was Madhyamavati. It is so over done at the hands of every musician that the raga is drained of all its charm. Still, it was methodically outlined by Gayatri. She conveyed that her training had prepared her for the deeper values of music.Well-articulatedShe gave a full-scale view of Madhyamavati. With an appealing voice and abundant talent,  she is now one among many young artists who are gaining  prominence. In rendering the kirtana &#8216;Venkatesa Ninnu&#8217;, her confidence and competence were explicit. More important, the sahitya was well-articulated and mild-mannered.Hemalatha provided violin support. Her measured response to Gayatri&#8217;s exposition was harmoniously catalytic bringing her kutcheri experience to the fore.  Her raga versions were sharp and specific.Ganapathiram (mridangam) and Trivandrum Rajagopal (ganjira) were percussion accompanists.T. M. Krishna&#8217;sperformance confirmed the impression of some rasikas that today, sensitivity is not his musical forte as much as his penchant for somewhat long alapanas.Hearing him over the years, the promise that, with his gifted voice, he would blossom into an aesthetic and polished vidwan, remains unfulfilled. Thodi and Begada were the two ragas presented in his venturesome mode.Every sanchara was packed in ostentatious classicism, compulsively competent, but not consummately reposeful. Signs and hints of manodharma enormity were full-blooded. Natural talent was helpless in reining him to moderation.He let go karvais and fluency in abundance, meant to startle the listeners, his mind intensely focussed on these two faculties. A voice meant to impart brilliance was deployed to dubious musical values.In Todi, he sang &#8216;Emi Jesithenemi&#8217;. There was a streak of sauciness in rendering it considering Karaikkudi Mani was accompanying on the mridangam. In the niraval passages of &#8216;Vara Mantram Anyulaku&#8221; (sahitya clarity a casualty) he forcefully kicked up excitement, pushing aside both sentiment and serenity. He achieved his objective in full measure. Similar was the treatment accorded to the song &#8216;Nadopasana&#8217; (Begada), keeping finesse at bay.Mysore Nagaraj on the violin, while keeping in step with Krishna, strayed away from the latter&#8217;s influence in his solo exposition of Begada. His version was somewhat a self-discovery of Begada&#8217;s  beauty. The exquisitely chiselled sancharas transformed Begada into an enchanting edifice. As a maestro, Karaikkudi Mani reiterated his value to the concert. In his hands lay the power and potency of laya. Anirudh Atreya played the ganjira.
