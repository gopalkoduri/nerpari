VThe Karnataka Sangeeta Nritya Academy recently organised a national festival of music in memory of the outstanding vocalist who dedicated his life to the dissemination of Gwalior gharana of music, Neelakanta Bua.The festival commenced with a unique violin &#8220;saha-vadan&#8221; recital by the couple Pt. B.S Math and Akkamahadevi Hiremath from Dharwad. An exponent of Gwalior and Kirana Gharanas, Pt. B.S Math is adept at both gayaki and tantrakari styles. His wife and disciple Akkamahadevi Hiremath particularly excels in rendition of the khyal in gayaki style. The Math couple chose raga Shyam Kalyan for a meticulously elaborate exposition. The rendition of the vilambit khyal was marked by a soothingly lyrical quality and many brilliantly imaginative passages . This was followed by a lilting drut teen tal chota khayal in the same raga. Their delineation of the chota khayal was a superb piece of artistry. The Math couple concluded their violin recital with a thumri in Misra Kafi. Pt Rajendra Nakod's energetic tabla accompaniment was greatly appreciated by the audience.However, the most eagerly awaited event of the evening was the vocal recital of the Misra brothers &#8211; Pt. Rajan and Pt. Sajan Misra who belong to the Benaras Gharana. In contemporary times, Pt. Rajan and Pt. Sajan Misra, among the most successful duet singers, are gifted with a rare sensitivity, their khyal compositions reflect a high regard for literary content, bring out their subtlest intended emotions and carry an instant appeal with the audience.The Misra brothers began their recital with the beautiful raga Jogkauns. Pt. Jagannath Buwa Purohit alias Gunidas, a doyen of the Agra Gharana and a master composer is accredited to have created this wonderful midnight melody which is an aesthetic blend of raga Jog and raga Chandrakauns. A judicious and tasteful use of the &#8220;komal nishad&#8221; note adds inexplicable grace to the rendition. For those familiar with the immortal bandishes of Gunidas: &#8220;Sughar var payo&#8221; in vilambit khayal and &#8220;Peer parayi jane nahi balamva&#8221; in this raga, there was a pleasant surprise. Their delineation of the vilambit khyal bandish &#8220;Kahe Guman&#8221; was marked by a sense of unsurpassable reposefulness, it was tranquil and sublime.A delicate handling of rhythm through the intricate creative process of alap-bol alap in the &#8220;raag vistar&#8221; made their rendition academically rich and melodically abounding. While executing intricate &#8220;taans&#8221; and &#8220;sargams&#8221; in the drut teental bandish &#8220;Jagat Sapna&#8221;, their wide ranging mellifluous voice combined with masterly command over the technique, enabled them to translate their highest flight of imagination into sublime music.Pt. Ravindra Yawagal on the tabla and Pt. Vyasmurthy Katti on the harmonium truly cast a magical spell on the listeners with their nuanced and exemplary &#8220;sath-sangat&#8221;. Pt Rajan and Sajan Misra enchanted the audience with a resplendent and galvanising rendition of jhaptaal composition &#8220;Garaja Ghata Ghan&#8221; and a vibrant chota khyal set to the fast paced drut teen tal in the romantic monsoon melody raga Megh.
