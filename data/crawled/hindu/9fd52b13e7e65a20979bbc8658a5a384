VA . Kanyakumari is one of those talented artists who, apart from being recognised as a leading violinist from the early 1970s, has made a mark for herself as a much sought after teacher. Many of her disciples are leading violinists in their own right.Kanyakumari is a highly innovative performer and has had varied roles in the concert platforms. Besides being a solo artist, she has been also been successful as an accompanist. Her instrumental ensembles comprising veena, nadaswaram and violin, have had good response from rasikas. Kanyakumari has also organised and performed along with 25 violinists and more. These novel programmes have been widely acclaimed.The twin effectKanyakumari has played the violin, recorded the same in one track and has later played in another track. These have been fused to give the double violin effect. This recent audio compact disc release, titled &#8216;Brahmmamokkate,' has been brought out under the banner of Krithika Audio and Videos.The violinist has chosen to play a dozen samkirtanas of Annamacharya in this recording. The orchestration by Kanyakumari is of a very high order and the musical interludes are as engaging as the main fare offered.K.V.Prasad (mridangam ) has had a long association with Kanyakumari and is able to anticipate her every move. His accompaniment is highly commendable. Most of the songs are popular creations of the composer and five out of the 12 compositions are ones popularised by M.S. Subbulakshmi.&#8216;Vandeham' ( Hamsadwani ) sets the ball rolling firmly. The following two sahityams are not oft heard ones -- &#8216;Eduta Unnadu' in Bhujangini, which sports the scale of Chakravaham minus the panchamam and &#8216;Ramachandrudu' in Dwijavanthi.The Sindhubhairavi composition, &#8216;Adi Deva,' is charmingly rendered. The songs following suit are &#8216;Okapari' (Karaharapriya ), &#8216;Bhavayami' (Yamunakalyani ), &#8216;Dolayam' (Khamas), the title song, &#8216;Brahmmamokkate' (Bowli ), &#8216;Yemako' ( Misra Tilang ), &#8216;Nanati' ( Revathi ), &#8216;Muddugare' ( Kurinji ) and &#8216;Jo Achutananda' (Kapi ). Sahitya bhava is given the right importance and as a result the effect of listening to the compositions is enhanced.The final lullaby in Kapi is extremely soothing.The role of the other accompanists Ganesh Rao (tabla and dolki ), Raghavendra Rao and Srinivasa Rao (violin ), Mudicondan Ramesh (Veena) and Sruthi Sagar (flute) is flawless.Krithika audio and Videos A.
