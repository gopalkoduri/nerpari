VVinjamuri Varadaraja Iyengar was a musician, musicologist and composer. Whenever his memorial concerts are staged, the participating artistes inevitably render one or two of his compositions. This year, the opening concert in Vinjamuri&#8217;s memory was given by Shertallay K.N. Ranganatha Sarma. He hails from a family of musicians. His father was the disciple of Semmangudi and was first guru of Ranganatha Sarma.Sarma was in the company of Ramaraju Dinkar on the violin, S. Aravind on the mridangam and P. Srinivasa Gopalan on the morsing. He has a robust voice with treble and melody in equal measure, with considerable range. He was at his best when he essayed ragas and better in his swarakalpana, but good when it comes to the expression of sahitya. It is good that he made a couple of Annamacharya kirtanas part of his well-set repertoire, mostly dominated by classical pieces of Dikshitar&#8217;s works.
