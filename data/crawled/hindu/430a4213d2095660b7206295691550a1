VGopalnath&#8217;s concert was captivating from start to end. The crowd swayed to his perfectly tuneful blowing and the melody he produced on his instrument. The concert was an example of how the melody and rhythm get interwined so well that the audience were listening to the artiste almost in a daze. Gopalnath got superb support from A. Kanyakumari on violin, Patri Satishkumar on the mridangam and B.S.Purushotam.The concert began with Abhogi varnam which was finished with kalpanaswaras in the third speed with amazing clarity. Kadri followed withVatapiin Hamsadhvani in the similar way bringing the house down with his brilliant swaras. Kanyakumari was also in great form giving fitting replies to the super fast kalpana swarass. Next came the majesticKamakshiswarajath in Bhairavi played with fine restraint and appealing gamakas. After this Gopalanath played Dikshitar&#8217;sAkhilandeswariin Dwijawanti, a raga rarely taken up for elaborate exposition. Kadri showed great efficiency in presenting the portrait of the raga in its beautiful form. This item was indeed a highlight in the concert. The item was a ragam, tanam, pallavi in Chandrakauns which closed as a ragamalika figuring Chakravakam and Kafi.The Sahityam of the pallivi wasSimhachala Nilaye-Sri Narasimha. There was a thrilling `tani&#8217; by the percussionists at the end of the Pallavi. The electrifying concert came to a close with Annamayya&#8217;sTandanana Ahiin Bowli.
