VThe Malleswaram Sangeetha Sabha, Bangalore, conducted its annual Hanuma Jayanthi Young Musicians&#8217; Competition Music Festival recently, which also formed part of its Diamond Jubilee Celebrations this year. According to B.K. Chandramouli, Secretary of the Sabha, the Festival was started some years ago to provide a forum for young musicians to perform, and be evaluated as concert artistes by veterans in the field.Nineteen artistes were featured across five concerts last week, the main artistes being Soumya Subbuganga, Madhuvanthi M.A., Sai Tejas Chandrasekhar, Amrutha Rao (Hindustani) and Anjali Shreeram. Senior vocalist M.T. Selvanarayana judged the performances and the following were declared the best in their respective fields: Sai Tejas Chandrasekhar (vocal), B. Vittala Rangan and H.M. Smitha (violin), Phaneendra Bhaskara (mridanga), Bhaskara Halambi (khanjari), and M.R. Purushotham (ghata).Anjali Shreeram&#8217;s Carnatic vocal recital at the Ananya Sabhangana on Saturday, accompanied by H.M. Smitha (violin), V. Nanjundamurthy (mridanga) and M.K. Vasavi Taranath (ghata), was part of the series.The fine selection of ragas and kritis by the main artiste fulfilled the aesthetic and technical pre-requisites for a successful concert. A clear voice with a good range, capable of executing a variety of sancharas in different speeds, and a confident demeanour on stage, accentuated the rigorous tutelage and training obviously imparted to her by her gurus.The concert began with &#8220;Intha Chalamu&#8221;, the Begada varna in adi tala, which was rendered in two speeds. &#8220;Paramathmudu&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in Vagadheeswari and the brief alapana - highlighting the juxtaposition of the anthara gandhara and the shatshruthi rishabha - that preceded it, displayed a feel for the essence of both raga and composition. &#8220;Nannu Vidachi&#8221; in Reethigowla and misra chapu thala was sung with much emotional intensity and involvement.A quick change of mood was effected with a racy &#8220;Niravadhi Sukhada&#8221;, another Thyagaraja krithi in Ravichandrika, set to adi tala. The alapana of Kalyani was sweet, with a fair sprinkling of brigha-oriented passages and some unusual patterns. &#8220;Ethavunara&#8221; was sung in an ideal kalapramana that underscored the beauty and gravity of the composition. Neraval at the anupallavi line beginning &#8220;Seetha Gowri&#8221; and kalpana swaras, with significant support and individualistic improvisations from both violinist and percussionists, were followed by an energetic tani avarthana.On the whole, the manodharma aspects such as raga alapana, neraval and kalpana swaras required greater depth and maturity, which will no doubt be acquired in due course of time, with more experience and performing opportunities, such as the one provided by the current Festival. In the Kalyani suite for instance, all three components had a few rough edges that could be smoothed out with a more systematic approach and greater application. Anjali Shreeram, and the accompanying artistes H.M. Smitha, V. Nanjundamurthy and M.K.Vasavi Taranath, displayed a great deal of promise and earnestness that augured well for their development into accomplished performing artistes.
