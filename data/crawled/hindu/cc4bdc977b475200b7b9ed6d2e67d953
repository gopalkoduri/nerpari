VPreparing the ground with a bright confident rendition of the Todi varnam &#8216;Era Naapai &#8217; in her vocal concert for Nada Inbam, Ranjani Hebbar moved on to &#8216;Raga Sudharasa&#8217; (Andolika, Tyagaraja).Her facile voice negotiated the demanding melodic terrain of the upper register in the anupallavi and charanam of the kriti with absolute ease. Well-chosen rounds of kalpanaswara threw shades of the raga into sharp relief.Key anchorage points at the panchama and tara sthayi shadja grounded a neat if somewhat unremarkable Saveri. Excursions to the tara sthayi madhyama effortlessly progressing to the dhaivata were enabled by a voice impeccably honed to kutcheri fitness.&#8216;Shankari Shankuru&#8217;, the Syama Sastri kriti, often chosen to emphasise change in tala (Adi, tisra gati) featured a compact niraval and kalpanaswara segment. &#8216;Padavini&#8217; (Salaga Bhairavi, Tyagaraja) came as a spirited filler with minimal swara rounds.The initial air of brisk efficiency that ran through the exposition of the main raga Kalyani soon changed as emphatic swaroopa-affirming sancharas at the gandhara and panchama contributed to an alapana that shone in the madhyamakala passages.Brigas appeared and departed with fleeting grace at the tara sthayi shadja. Swift, glittering flights from the gandhara and beyond, gained in passionate conviction and were charged with buoyancy and unimpeded flow that makes listening to naturally gifted artists such a pleasure.Ranjani&#8217;s version inspired the violinist Shertalai Shivakumar to search for new perspectives that coincided with the vocalist&#8217;s vision in part. &#8216;Eta Vunara&#8217; (Tyagaraja) took pride of place with niraval linking organically evolving concepts. Swaraprastara made a brief foray into tisra patterns and banked on catchy little kanakkus in the kuraippu.A crystalline voice that traverses octaves with winsome insouciance gives this vocalist a head start in setting consistent standards of musical excellence. By gradually veering towards the realm of inward seeking exploration in addition to the current priority of honing her kutcheri craft, Ranjani could easily attain these standards.B. Ganapathy Raman&#8217;s mridangam accompaniment carried customary flair and diligence, his-off-the beaten-track arudis drawing attention.
