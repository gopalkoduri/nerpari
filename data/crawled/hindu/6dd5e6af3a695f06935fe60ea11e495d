VThe final session of the recent two-day 15th Lakshmi Narashima Jayanthi Utsavam, organised by the Shree Vishnu Sahasranama Namasankirtana Mandali in association with the Sri Adi Sankara Sewa Samajam in the latter's temple premises at New Delhi's Mayur Vihar Phase III, drew the participation of G.S. Mani, a senior vocalist from Chennai. His vocal recital in the session spanning about two-and-half hour, was not a traditional Carnatic music concert in the strictest terms. The improvisation techniques, namely raga alapana and swaraprastharas, did not quite get the kind of treatment that it should have got. Niraval was conspicuous by its absence in the entire concert. The miscellaneous session, after the tani avartanam (percussion solo) was lengthier, in which Mani included abhang and compositions that were based on Hindustani ragas. Mani also included quite a few of his own compositions in the concert. One, however, did not quite experience a complete feeling of being in a vocal concert.Mani began with his composition, &#8220;Varaguna gambira gajavadanam&#8221; in raga Kanada, which was followed by yet another composition of his own, &#8220;Ramaniya shanvadana&#8221; in the raga Hamsanadam. Harikesanallu Muthia Baghavadar's &#8220;Vijayambike&#8221; in raga Vijayanagari was emotive. Mani took up two of Tyagaraja's compositions, namely, &#8220;Sitamma mayamma&#8221; in raga Vasantha and &#8220;Upacharamu&#8221; in raga Bhairavi for somewhat detailed renditions. Delhi R. Sridhar on the violin and Kumbakonam N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam provided good support in the concert. Though Sridhar's sketch of the raga Bhairavi was good and contained delightful phrases, there were missing links in between these phrases at a few places. Padmanabhan's tani avartanam in the Rupakam tala was lively.The two-day festival included a grand Sita Kalyana Mahotsavam in the bhajan paddhati led by Shankara Subramania Avadhani.Short of expectationsElsewhere, at the India International Centre, Delhi's Guruvayoor T.V. Manikandan's vocal recital too fell short of expectations. Though it was in the traditional concert format, Manikandan's choice of the ragas and songs for the concert seemed to be aimed at the cosmopolitan audience. However, his diction of Sanskrit compositions was striking.Manikandan began his concert impressively with an Adi tala varnam in raga Saraswathi, in two taals, though the changeover in taal was not quite a smooth affair. While Tulasivanam's &#8220;Bajamanasa Vigneshwaram&#8221; in raga Bahudari was suffixed with crisp swaraprastharas, Swati Tirunal's &#8220;Gangeya vasana&#8221; in raga Hamirkalyani was prefixed with the raga alapana. After presenting Muthuswami Dishidar's &#8220;Sree Mathrubootham&#8221; in raga Kannada and Tyagaraja's &#8220;Bagayanayya&#8221; in raga Chandrajyothi, Manikandan moved to the central item of his concert, which was Mysore Vasudevachar's &#8220;Bhajare re mansa&#8221; in raga Abheri. While the presentation of the composition as such was good, the delineation of the raga was mediocre. The finishing korvai in the swaraprastharas too was not a smooth affair. Niraval, another important tool of improvisation technique, was conspicuous by its absence. VSK Chakrapani on the violin and Kumbakonam N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam provided able support in the concert. While Chakrapani's delineation of the ragas Hamirkalyani and Abheri were delightful, Padmanabhan's tani avartanam in Adi tala was engaging.
