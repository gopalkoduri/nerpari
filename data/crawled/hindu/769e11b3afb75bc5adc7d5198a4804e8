VShe enthralled the audience with sangatis that were a combination of fast brigas  and long karvais, during the alapana.Padma Shankar (violin) was equally competent in her essay. Tyagaraja&#8217;s Rupaka tala kriti &#8216;Evara Madu Kudhura&#8217; was presented with kalpanaswaras that were within classical limits.The anticipation of Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar (mridangam) in this segment must be specially mentioned. Equally adroit was Anirudh Athreya on the kanjira.Dhanyasi is a raga that is rarely presented these days.  It was refreshing to listen to Mala, who took  it up for a detailed alapana. Her manodharma  helped her delineate it with rich colours.The Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Mayuranatham Anisham Bhajami&#8217; (Mishra Chapu) transported one to the beautiful temple of Sri Abhayambika Samedha Mayuranatha Swami at Mayiladuthurai. Intelligently Mala avoided the swaras for this song. Her firm belief in purist tradition was evident when she next took up Khambodi. It was an emphatic statement of the raga. The development was in a slow tempo befitting the raga&#8217;s grandeur.Padma Shankar&#8217;s spirited reply had a lot of Lalgudi brand phrases that made it even more interesting. The monumental Gopalakrishna Bharathi kriti &#8216;Tiruvadi Charanam&#8217; was an apt choice with niraval in the charanam.Diction  is very important and it was jarring  to hear her pronounce the word &#8216;Sonnalum&#8217; as &#8216;Shonnalum&#8217; repeatedly during the niraval. Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar&#8217;s thani with Anirudh Athreya was replete with mel kalam phrases. The tisra nadai in particular was a beauty.
