VNOT MANY would have heard of the `gottu vadyam'. This rare instrument is almost on the verge of extinction, but for the efforts of a select few musicians.Even as Srirama Gana Sabha, one of the oldest organisations dedicated to the cause of music, celebrates its fortnight-long 36th Aradhana festival of Thyagaraja, the instrument stole the show on the fourth day of the fest.Held in the Sabha premises at Sriramalayam, New Nallakunta, most of the programmes in the fest were designed to encourage young  talent,  among whom was Emani Lalitha Krishna.  Lalitha, who specialises in playinggottu vadyam, received advanced training on the nuances of playing the instrument from Ravi Kiran of Chennai.So impressed was Kiran with her learning skills and talent that he even presented her with a gottu veena. Lalitha today has the distinction of being the only gottu vadyam player in Andhra Pradesh. She is proficient with the Mandolin too.On this occasion, Lalitha began with a `Sahana Varnam'. Despite the difficulties involved in playing a varnam on the gottu with high speed, she came up with a virtuoso performance.The major items during her performance were `Anupama Gunambudhi' in `Athana', which built a congenial atmosphere.`Niravadhisukhada' in `Udayaravichandrika' preceded the raga essay of Poorvikalyani. The raga essay turned out to be a remarkable effort as she played with ease and a sense of beauty.Gjnanamosagarada of Thyagaraja was marked by imaginative swara play, which was the highlight of concert. Teliyaleru Rama in Dhenuka is another number worth mentioning as one of her fine renditions. Dhananjay on violin and Vidyasagar on mridangam lent support.G.SBottom Template Starts
