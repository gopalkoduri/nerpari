VAishwarya Vidhya Raghunath has a mature and slightly husky voice that suits Carnatic music very well. She proved in her 90-minute concert for Rasika Ranjani Sabha  that she was capable of handling heavy ragas  with skill. The ragas taken up  were Surutti and Kalyani. Surutti is not generally selected for detailing except when the vocalist is confident of his/her potential in handling that particular song.  Aishwarya was fairly good in the delineation.  But the same, however, cannot be said about her essay of Kalyani.The exposition was jerky and several neatly done reposeful kaarvais turned slightly repetitive and the alapana moved at a sluggish pace.Slow pieceKalyani with its vivacity needs some faster segments also to project a complete picture.  Here also Aishwarya's choice was an incredibly slow piece.   The kalpanaswaras were done in two speeds but that was not of much help. To keep up the momentum of the concert at an even pace, Aishwarya added `Sarasi-ruhasana' in Mukhari and `Vinanasakoni' in Prathapavarali both by Tyagaraja.Akkarai Swarnalatha was careful in her versions of the ragas and swaras. R. Sankaranarayanan was the bright youngster who bolstered the concert with brisk rhythm.G. SWAMINATHANBottom Template Starts
