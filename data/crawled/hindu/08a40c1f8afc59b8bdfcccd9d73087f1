VConnoisseurs of music at Mysore had a feast of enchanting concerts at different venues. Notable were those by young musicians &#151;  S. P. Ramh at Nadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha, Bangalore S. Shankar at Veene Seshanna Bhavana and Mysore M. Nagaraj at Sri Rajendra Bhavana under the aegis of J.S.S. Sangeetha Sabha Trust.Vocalist S.P. Ramh from Chennai was at his best at Nadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha. Blessed with a rich tonal frequency and involvement in rendition, his diction of sahitya was appreciable. The dexterity in delineation of raga-bhava was luscious. The highlight was the vilambakala composition "Mamava Meenakshi" (raga Varali normally inherited from guru to shishya). B.K. Raghuram on the violin provided excellent support while G.S. Ramanujam on the mridanga and V.S. Ramesh on mruchangi sustained the tempo.Bangalore S. Shankar's concert at Veene Seshanna Bhavana was remarkable. He gave equal emphasis on raga-bhava and sahitya. His svara kalpana needed more modulation and the tri-stayi sancahri was notable with able support by Charulatha Ramanujam on violin, H.L. Shivashankara Swamy on the mridanga. Impressive selections such as "Makelara Vicharamu", "Vandanamu Sri Raghunandana", "Pavanaja Stuti Patra" and "Tava Dasoham Dasharate" from Tyagaraja, "Tamboori Meetidava", "Deva Banda Namma Swami Bandano" and ugabhoga "Dhyanavu kruthayugadolu" from Purandaradasa took the concert to greater heights. H.L. Ananthakrishna on the ghata was impressive, but S. Ramani's supporting voice needs more experience.B.S.S. RAOBottom Template Starts
