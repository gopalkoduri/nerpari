VDr. R. GaneshCarnatic classical vocalJass Visions &#8211; Rs. 200.Dr. R. Ganesh belongs to quite a special musical lineage of renowned composers Kavikunjara Bharati and Koteeswara Iyer. He has trained under several gurus including the inimitable  Maharajapuram Santhanam who honed and polished his skills to apprecia\u000able levels. His programme begins on an even keel with Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s beautiful varnam on Lord Krishna in Charukesi.&#8216;Gajavadana Beduve&#8217; wrapped in melodic Hamsadhwani has a supple, easy grace, not too much bound by lakshana parameters. The kalpanaswaras and soft swara lagu sequences are pleasing, without aggressiveness and excess calculations. The violinist is V.V. Srinivasa Rao extends his full support in the shadja kuraippu and also scores in his reply.Vellore Ramabhadran, a past master in sarvalagu, makes his own positive contribution.Maharajapuram Santhanam was a shrewd musician who knew exactly how to woo his audience. His concerts were interspersed with heavy and light classical melodies to sustain interest. His Brindavana Saranga was an aural treat, and Ganesh faithfully toeing the line emerges with credit in his rendition of &#8216;Swaminathena&#8217; of Dikshitar.A Santhanam composition on the Mahaperiyavar of Kanchi in Saramati is rendered with considerable feeling and emotion. The words ending with &#8216;m&#8217; would sound more pleasing if articulated with the lips closed.The artiste is quite strong in the melody department and his Arabhi, in the footsteps of his guru, is a satisfying essay even with the occasional ifs and buts. The tuneful response on the violin is woven with incisive understanding of dos and donts of the raga.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Choothamu Rare&#8217; is a version sung in the customary Maharajapuram style. Varali is rather an out-of-the-ordinary range of ragas, since its gandharam is neither a plain suddha gandharam nor the higher sadharana gandharam, but is always gentle oscillating note and the trace of chatusruti rishabam have to be handled with kid gloves.The singer as well as the violinist have in their essays done commendable justice to the inherent sophistication of Varali. Syama Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Kamakshi&#8217; that is perhaps beyond compare in the genre of bhakti, is interpretated with an involved, prayerful spirit. &#8216;Kantajoodumi&#8217; in Vachaspati with its niraval, swaras and the final korvai fulfils concert requirements.Khambodi is elaborated with confidence, focussing on its majestic stature with relevant prayogas covering the differing sthayis.However, it would make for more rewarding listening, if certain phrases where the sadharana gandharam is heard, could be jettisoned.&#8216;Maragathavallim&#8217; of Dikshitar that became so popular because of the vintage expression of G.N. Balasubramaniam, is invested with bhava and clear enunciation.The swaras in two speeds provide the launching pad for Vellore Ramabhadran&#8217;s decorous, dignified thani avarthanam tugging even a layman&#8217;s chord.&#8216;Nandagopala&#8217; in Yamunakalyani, &#8216;Manave Mantraalya,&#8217; a ragamalika, and a Sai Bhajan in Vaasanthi speak highly of Ganesh&#8217;s penchant for aesthetic presentation.
