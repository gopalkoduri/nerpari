VVisakha Music Academy featured a veena recital by J. Yoga Vandana of Bangalore accompanied by Mandapaka Nagalakshmi on the mridangam and S. Hanumantha Rao on ghatam, who are much experienced and highly graded artistes of AIR, at Kalabharathi on last Sunday evening.It was a fairly successful effort making and was in the traditional form of carnatic music evolved by her gurus, Subhashini Sastry and noted vidwan V.S. Anantha Rao. Vandana evoked and sustained audience interest all along. Playing the choicest bholes along with the lively sound of the mridangam played by Nagamani and followed well by Hanumantha Rao on the ghatam added to the harmony.The highlights were the elaboration of Syama Sastry's Himadri Suthe Pahimam (Kalyani) and Dikshitar's &#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Bhairavi keerthana Balagopala dealt in detail. Starting with the Nata varnam in Aditalam, Vandana rendered Sree Mahaganapathim (Goula), Manavi Aalakimcharaadate (Nalinikanthi), Bhogendra Sayinam (Kuntalavarali), Purandhara dasa's and Annamayya's compositions besides Tillana and Maund.
