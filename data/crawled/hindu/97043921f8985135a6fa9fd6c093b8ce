VAnnamacharya Raga\u000aRaginiWWW.Siliconandhra.org\u000aRaginiRaginiLalgudi Srimathi BrahmanandamA dozen sankitanas of Talapakkam Annamacharya set to music by Lalgudi Srimathi Brahmanandam feature in this pleasant audio CD. The ragas chosen are rakthi melodies which always engage the listeners.Anuradha Sridhar is the main singer, who is ably supported by Ananya Ashok and Apoorva Krishna. Sriram Brahmanandam offers meaningful percussive support on the mridangam. Anuradha has also contributed with her melodious violin accompaniment.The instrumental interludes are of a high order and strictly conform to the arohana and avarohana of the ragas employed. Clarity in the lyric has contributed to the overall effectiveness of this recording apart from the bhava-rich vocalisation.Variety galoreThe ragas selected for the compositions are Anandabhairavi, Sahana, Kapi, Khambhodi, Mukhari, Charukesi, Varali, Kedaragowla, Hamirkalyani, Saramathi and Yamunakalyani. A lone ragamalika also figures which is particularly notable for the segment in Kanada.The final composition is set to a bewitchingly beautiful Yamunakalyani, which makes an ideal &#8216;jodi' to the popular &#8216;Bhavayami Gopalabalam'.Ravi Gutala (tabla), Ashwin Krishnakumar (flute), Mukundan Narasimhan and Rajesh Naroth (keyboard) have contributed in the instrumental orchestration. The inlay card also mentions the hardly audible veena accompaniment of Ananya Ashok.
