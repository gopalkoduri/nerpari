VT he Hindustani classical vocal music recital of Apoorva Gokhale, disciple of Vidushi Manik Bhide and Pandit Shankar Abhyankar was organised by Sur Sagar recently in Bangalore.Apoorva impressed connoisseurs with her erudite, sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing gayaki. Her khyal music incorporated the exquisite features of Gwalior, Jaipur, and Agra gharanas with a remarkable sense of harmony and fluidity.Complex raagApoorva commenced her recital with raga Poorvi, a sandhiprakash raga sung at twilight. Apoorva's delineation of this raga in the vilambit ek tal bandish &#8220;Piharwaa&#8221; through the customary alap in sthayi and antara parts of the composition showed her mastery over the intricate aspects of this complex Shadava Sampurna raag, which uses both the shuddha and teevra forms of the madhyam note in beguiling splendour.Apoorva's improvisations in alap and bol taan sections of the vilambit khayal were marked by a rich diversity.In the fast-paced drut teen tal bandish &#8220;Savani Surat Mann Bhave&#8221;, Apoorva dazzled her listeners with a variety of sapat, koot and gamak taans in all the three octaves, displaying the impressive range of her melodious voice.Apoorva's rendition of the popular raga Tilak-Kamod had brilliant flashes of Marathi natya sangeet influence. The Roopak tal bandish &#8220;Sur Sangat Raag Vidya&#8221; was followed by a vibrant tarana in the same raga that was a perfect aesthetic musical thought devoid of words.Apoorva developed the bandishes through commendable imaginative versatility and grace that left the audience hankering for more.Her taans were very attractive rapid melodic passages, replete with ornamental murkhis. Tilak Kamod was followed by another exquisite melody of the monsoon season Gaud Malhar. Apoorva's delineation of the teental bandish &#8220;Saiyya Morare&#8221; exuded great lyrical appeal.The tarana in this raga was also a unique bandish ka tarana. Although Apoorva's renditions of Purvi and Tilak Kamod were quintessentially in the Gwalior and Agra gharana style, in her masterful presentation of the rare raga Sampurna Malkauns popularised by the exponents of Athrauli-Jaipur Gharana, especially Pandita Kishori Amonkar and her disciple Manik Bhide, Apoorva demonstrated that she is conversant with the subtle aspects of Jaipur gayaki as well.Apoorva made a laudatory attempt to unravel the wonderful dimensions of this uncommon challenging raga albeit her delineation of the majestic, teental bandish &#8220;Barja Rahi&#8221; immortalised by Kishori Amonkar, which seemed like a hurried, truncated presentation. However, the redeeming feature was the beautiful layakari that distinguished the chota khyal in drut teental in the same raga.Vyasmuthy Katti on the harmonium provided a very enriching inspirational support to the vocalist throughout the concert while Uday Raj Karpur's mellowed tabla accompaniment greatly enhanced the superb layakari and taankari of the vocalist.Apoorva's rendition of the popular Marathi abhang of Sant Gyaneshwar &#8220;Roopa Pahata Lochani, Sukh Jhale Wo Sajani&#8221; soaked in bhakti rasa had immense emotional appeal.The audience was mesmerised by the incantatory refrain &#8220;Toha Vittala Warava to ha Madhava Warava&#8221; against the backdrop of the reverberating syllables of the bhajan theka. Apoorva concluded her recital with the thumri &#8220;Karan Mori Lagire Kanhai&#8221; in raag Bhairavi.K.S. VAISHALI
