VSarvani Sangeetha Sabha recently introduced a young promising singing duo, the Vizianagaram Brothers (Santhosh Kumar and Chaitanya Kumar Charan) to Chennai audiences through the Annamacharya Jayanthi deliberations.The concert at the Music Academy, in fact, featured not just the brothers but also their father and guru B.A. Narayana. That any musician with a streak of promise and a dash of talent is encouraged by the Chennai audiences was proved through this concert.  Narayana and the young performers exhibited their sincere proclivity to good and melodious music.With similar vocal prowess, both Santhosh and Chaitanya kept the initial section going with clear articulation and fine enunciation of some Annamacharya keerthanas. Colourful ragas such as Nattai (&#8216;Devasigamani Divijulu&#8217;), Vasantha (&#8216;Vadevenkatadri&#8217;), Arabhi (&#8216;Arakinchi&#8217;) paved the passage to a detailing of Thodi jointly by the brothers. This part showed the youngsters&#8217; slight trepidation in developing a raga with spontaneity and confidence. True, the well rehearsed phrases stressed Thodi strongly but one could also feel the need for the singers to evolve more effectively and assertively in their approach. &#8216;Palinchu palinchu&#8217; was the kriti and the exchange of swaras at &#8216;Loka Sakshidivo&#8217; with sa as the landing swara was interestingly built up.Teacher and father Narayana entered the fray at this point with the alapana of Poorvikalyani. His interpretation showed maturity. The composition &#8216;Nallani Meni Nagavuju&#8217; with streams of kalpanaswaras was his exclusive contribution. The Shanmukhapriya essay was shared by all with zeal but the overall structure fell short of expectations, though individual parts were appealing. &#8216;Parama Purusha Nirupamana&#8217;, the famous Annamacharya number turned out to be their choice here and there was a sketchy niraval and tentative swara exchange by Santhosh and Chaitanya in the charanam, &#8216;Chatura Moorithi Chatura Bahu&#8217;.&#8216;Narayana Namo (Behag), &#8216;Edu Mannduvide Ee Baludu&#8217; (Bindumalini) and &#8216;Enta Matramu&#8217; (Brindavanasaranga) were some of the other inclusions in the programme. K.P. Nandini, another up and coming artist, provided commendable support on the violin. Her responses in raga alapana especially in Thodi and Shanmukhapriya showed how a raga should be developed organically. The opening, development, stays and pauses were neatly connected and presented well by Nandini. Kodapalli Ramesh&#8217;s mridangam playing was another energiser for the young performers.
