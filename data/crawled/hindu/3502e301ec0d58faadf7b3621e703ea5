Aravind Bharghava, a talented youngster, is learning mandolin from the legendry maestro U. Srinivas in Chennai. This boy, who is also doing B. Tech in sound engineering has developed a good attitude towards mandolin and has shown a lot of promise in his performance .Aravind began his recital with Vasantha varnam Ninnukori in a steady kalapramana and went on to play Giriraja Sutha in Suddha Bangala with brisk swarkalpana. Sama was taken next and here he played Annapoorne in a soothing layam. Aravind imbibed good understanding of the ragam and displayed good performance. Bindumalaini, a rare ragam of the Thyagaraja, was taken for Entha muddhu enta sogasu and played it in the right proportion. Ninnu vina namadin, a noted composition of Thyagaraja, was done with all the sangathis and made it more enjoyable.The main attraction of the day was Kharaharapriya. Aravind did his homework thoroughly and brought out all the nuances of the ragam. He showed good technique and his ragam delineation was mature enough. He chose Ragam Tanam Pallavi and the tanam was played in three speeds and the pallavi was set to adi talam for samam. He played the pallavi in a brief way with soothing swarakalpana.The violin support by senior artiste Poosarla Manorama elevated the concert. Mridangam by P.V. Ramanamurthy added lustre along with Shyama on kanjeera. Their tani in adi was enjoyable. The acoustics could have been well-balanced to make the concert more soothing to the ears.Aravind concluded his recital with Chinnam chiru kiliye, a ragamalika composed by Subramanya Bhartiyar, and then Narayanathe in Behag of Annamacharya.
