VSome puritans had for long looked down upon  Kathakali vocal music as a corruption of Carnatic classical music. A handful of Kathakali vocalists  to liberate the &#8216;verbal acting&#8217; of Kathakali from the unscientific application of ragas and \u000a non-systematic renditions in  different octaves. Of them, Venmani Haridas is an immortal name. He refined the musical techniques of each and every padam in popular Kathakali plays without sacrificing the basic characteristics of functional music. His command over  nuances of ragas, varying rhythms and  tempos were in perfect harmony with the essential bhavas of Kathakali music. The two-hour CDs in two parts, which is under review, are testimony to this well-established fact.Recorded directly from a stage performance, the CDs are a musical voyage through the famous Kathakali play &#8216;Santhanagopalam.&#8217; Haridas and his co-singers Kalamandalam Babu Namboodiri and Kalanilayam Rajeevan (supporting vocalist), are at their best in the opening slokam, &#8216;Paramapurushanevam,&#8217; and the padam, &#8216;Srimansakhe! Vijaya&#8217; in Saveri. Krishna&#8217;s affection towards  Arjuna has been refreshingly captured in the  treatment of the padam. Arjuna&#8217;s reply, &#8216;Nadha! Bhavalcharana,&#8217; in raga Devagandhari, is soaked in devotion as Haridas delves deep into its sahitya.The subsequent padam of the Brahmin who arrives at Dwaraka from afar is in the slow tempo and in the typically Kerala raga Dukhakhandaram. Here again, Haridas and Babu evoke  the  anguish of the Brahmin who laments  the death of his sons.  Arjuna&#8217;s boastful padam in raga Begada is simply amazing in the voice and stylistic purity of Haridas.Haridas is at his best  when he sings the padam &#8216;Vidhimatham nirasicheetamo?&#8217; He has recomposed it in Revathi. The true genius of Haridas is revealed as he expresses  the grief of the Brahmin&#8217;s wife, which is disguised by her philosophical  words. Another composition that stands out is  &#8216;Jeevithanayaka&#8217; in Kanakurinji, which is a raga in  Kerala&#8217;s own Sopana Sangeetam. All the padams that follow in the medium and fast tempos are deeply etched in the minds of the rasikas. Haridas has succeeded in providing an alluring individual identity to all those renditions. Hence the stanzas in ragas such as Mukhari, Mohanam, Thodi, Puranira and Revagupthi are all a euphonious bouquet of notes and lyrics.  The only one that sounds a bit odd is &#8216;Kalyanaalaye chettum&#8217; in  Kunthalavarali.Since the recording is from an onstage performance, there are constant repetition of lines in the charanams to go with the movements and expressions of the actors. For an audio-CD, this is uncalled for since repetitions sans flourishes create monotony at times. At the same time, one can easily discern  from the CDs the profundity with which Haridas dealt with the theatrical treasures of Kathakali music. Even when stressing on the swara cadences of Carnatic music for the padams in  Sankarabharanam, Haridas never inflicts any wounds on the sahityabhava.The names of chenda and maddalam artistes  are  missing in the CD cover. Yet with all the limitations, the CDs are worth emulating by young generation singers.Santhanagopalam Kathakali Padangal &#8211; Venmani HaridasReleased by Venmani Haridas Anusmarana Samithi, Vellarappilly.Price: Rs.100
