VA graceful blend of many talents and interests, the acclaimed veena player Suma Sudhindra has yet another recognition coming her way. She is being conferred the &#8220;Gaana Varidhi&#8221; title by the M.A. Narasimhachar Music Foundation. This comes a few weeks after her becoming member of Kendra Sangeet Natak Akademi.Infusing new ideasSuma, as President of Academy of Music, Chowdiah Memorial Hall, Bangalore, has been conducting unusual programmes as part of their festival. Besides the regular kutcheries, it includes &#8220;lobby concerts&#8221; &#8211;&#8211; a new concept pioneered by the Academy under Suma since last year.When you compliment her for that, she replies modestly: &#8220;I am only trying to give back to music all I have received. Towards that, I organise as many events/concerts as possible to showcase famous artistes and promising young talent. I also arrange lecdems which is documented for the use of students of music and research scholars.&#8221;Suma has immense commitment to the cause of classical music. But then Suma's great obsession has been the veena, of which she is today an exponent. Her tryst with this stringed instrument began with initial training under Bangalore's Raja Rao. She then sought out the late, renowned vainika C. Chittibabu, and enrolled as his student. As she reveals: &#8220;Chittibabu not only imparted his vast knowledge to me but also educated me on vital aspects like planning and presentation of a concert which contributed greatly to my success as a performer. I also benefited from the exposure to the many famous musicians who visited his house.&#8221;Suma's innate talent and creativity along with diligent practice ensured she was soon performing at prestigious platforms in India and abroad including on TV and radio; impressing connoisseurs and laypersons alike.Suma also attempted fusion music and is now heads Megha, an East-West ensemble playing Carnatic-Jazz. She is quick to point out: &#8220;The tendency to dismiss all fusion as confusion is unfair. The music we make is an intelligent combination which draws on the best of both genres for a rich and beautiful synergy. Established artistes attempt fusion after careful research so the end-result is enriching to both forms.&#8221;Suma is also credited with the invention of Tarangini, an innovation on the traditional Saraswati veena. Tarangini doesn't have a kodam (acoustic resonator) &#8211;&#8211; magnetic pick-ups do the needful. With no wax-base for frets, one doesn't need to adjust the melam frequently. Guitar keys substitute pegs and give shruti stability.Moreover, this Nandiwood veena is light and portable. It is thus Suma's choice for her concerts outside Bangalore. Suma believes there is no substitute for hard work if one wants to excel in any field. &#8220;No doubt, inherent talent makes a difference &#8211;&#8211; it makes you learn faster. But even the gifted need practice to hone their skills. For anyone, practice should never be careless or blind repetition but intelligent, focused and creative saadhana. Soon, the student will blossom and also evolve his unique style and technique aside from reflecting his teacher's baani.&#8221;
