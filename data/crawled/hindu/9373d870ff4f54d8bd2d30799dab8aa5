VMES Kalavedi, Bangalore hosted a thematic concert series titled Sri Thyagaraja's Sangeetha Tatwa Siddhantha by vidwan R.K. Srikantan, accompanied by R.S.Ramakantha (vocal support), T.T. Srinivasan (violin), M.T. Rajakesari (mridanga), and Ranganatha Chakravarthy (ghata).The second day of the series began with an elucidation of the importance of nadayoga and the krithi &#8216;Nadopasana' set to Begada raga and adi thala, which describe Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma as nadopasakas. &#8216;Sogasuga Mridanga Thalamu' in Sriranjini raga and adi thala was next presented as an example of the composer's views on the ideal ingredients, such as yathi, vishrama and virathi, that should go into the making of a song, Purandaradasa's &#8216;Thala Beku' in Bhairavi and mishra chapu thala was cited, and sung, as echoing similar sentiments. The veteran artiste emphasized that technical perfection by itself is not sufficient and that bhakthi has been an integral part of the traditional Indian concept of music. Thyagaraja's conviction that &#8216;true music' is one that leads to spiritual upliftment and to salvation was explained and exemplified through &#8216;Sitavara Sangeetha Jnanamu' in Devagandhari raga and adi thala. Each of the compositions was prefixed with compact but bhava infused raga alapanas.Srikantan touched upon the saint composer's view that knowledge of music without bhakthi is futile, and that without bhakthi one cannot attain a state of supreme bliss or &#8216;paramananda'.Significantly, he asserted, Thyagaraja's exhortations and admonitions were, almost always, not to others but to himself .The import of &#8220;Mariyadagadura&#8221; and &#8220;Swararagasudha&#8221; in Shankarabharanam, extolling the unmatched power of music to confer moksha, and cautioning those who practiced it without devotion, was explained and the compositions sung after a brief elaboration of the raga. &#8220;Vararagalaya&#8221; in Chenchukamboji, dealing with some minute details of music and the power of Omkara, was also sung as an example of Thyagaraja's engagement with the nature of music and its purpose, as not mere entertainment but the &#8216;composite solution for comprehensive human development'.&#8220;Shanthamuleka&#8221;, expounding the precept that no amount of worldly comforts, rituals or knowledge can offer succour without equanimity of mind and tranquility, set to Sama raga and adi thala, was prefaced with a swift raga outline. The concluding piece of the day was &#8220;Guruleka Etuvanti&#8221; in Gaurimanohari raga, encapsulating Thyagaraja's concept of the guru, who alone can illumine the path to enlightenment.The final and third part of the series commenced with a felicitation to the veteran artiste on being bestowed with the Padma Bhushan. The recital commenced with &#8220;Kalalanerchina&#8221; in Deepaka raga, followed by &#8220;Bhajana Seyave&#8221; in Kalyani, which refer to the sixty four arts, which by themselves cannot grant redemption. &#8220;Sukhi Evaro&#8221; in Kanada, &#8220;Sripapriya Sangeetopasana&#8221; in Athana, &#8220;Sangeethashastra Jnanamu&#8221; in Mukhari, and &#8220;Ramanamam Bhajare&#8221; in Madhyamavathi were the other inclusions in an erudite and inspirational presentation. The series, which threw light on Thyagaraja's perceptions about the higher purpose of music, and his philosophy of life in general, through a wide and varied selection of krithis, was accentuated by the pristine clarity of the maestro's renderings, and able support from the accompanying artistes.
