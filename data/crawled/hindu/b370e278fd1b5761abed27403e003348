VOne of the highlights of the cultural programmes organised as part of the 8th biennial World Telugu Conference held on the premises of V.R. Sidhardha Engineering College on the outskirts of Vijayawada was a brief concert by Malladi brothers &#8212;Sriram Prasad and Ravi Kumar.The popular duo made the concert highly enjoyable with fitting selection of items suitable for the occasion and the elite crowd that assembled under the huge pandal savoured the music.Though there was enough time to exhibit theirmanodharmamtalent, the Malladi brothers compensated well with their tuneful singing andbhavaladen rendering of the items. They started withTulasidalamulache...in Mayamalavagowla and followed it with the Pancharatna KeertanaEndaro...,andAntaramamayam...of Ramadasu in Varali, a Kshetrayya PaadamAligite...in Husseini and atarangamPooraya Mamakamam...in Bilahari.The concert came to a close with an Annamacharya keertana in Dwijavanthi andSri Rama Jaya Rama..., a Thyagaraja Divyanama Keertana in Yadukula Kambhoji. Good instrumental support was provided by Palaparti Nageswara Rao (violin), M. Laksminarayana Raju (mridangam), M. Haribabu (ghatam) and Raghuram Hari (morsing).Some more cultural programmes held this week are Dr.Y.S. Raju and party&#8217;s Burrakatha on Potti Sriramulu, Lalitha Sangeeta Vibhavari conducted by Modumudi Sudhakar and Baby Vindhyavasini&#8217;s rendering of Sri Suktam.The Sangeeta Vibhavari performed by the visually challenged students of the Itrod Sunetra School was poignant and had the audience in tears. Among the dance and drama programmes, some highlights wereSrikrishna Rayabarampresented by Jai Sri Shanmukha Natyamandali, the playletTelugu Bhashapresented by Sri Sai Arts of Kolakaluru, in which dialogues were spoken in different regional dialects of the State.
