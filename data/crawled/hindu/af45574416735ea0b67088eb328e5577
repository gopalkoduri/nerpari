VContinuing the more than a decade-old tradition, Sangeetha Sanmandali, the Vijayawada-based cultural organisation, conducted the week-long &#8216;Sadguru Sri Tyagaraja Swamivari Aaradhana Sangeethotsavam&#8217; from January 14 to 20 at Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao Government College for Music and Dance, to pay tributes to the greatest of the Vaggeyakaras of Carnatic music.The organisation was founded in 1995 by a group of professional musicians and music lovers to create a platform for up and coming vocalists and instrumentalists to display their talent, and it has been conducting the event without fail since then. Its president Pemmaraju Surya Rao says that the week-long Sangeethotsavam is known for punctuality, discipline and adherence to certain principles. As he points out, no musician, however great and well-known he or she may be, is allowed to do &#8216;Swarakalpana&#8217; and will have to complete the performance well within the prescribed time limit. There is a strict dress code too, for both male and female performers.Though the organisation does not pay the musicians who come from various parts of the State and occasionally even abroad towards their travel and other expenses, scores of musicians, on their own, unfailingly turn up every year to participate in the event. The organisation only provides them simple accommodation and meals. &#8220;All this is possible only because of the munificent contributions of music lovers settled in the US and some philanthropists here,&#8221; says Surya Rao.This year the event saw participation of close to 200 artists, who performed in morning and evening sessions. The number of artists who performed as well as the number of people who turned up for listening to their concerts has seen a satisfactory increase over last year, Surya Rao notes.The highlight of the week-long event, as usual, was the collective rendition of Pancharatna Krithis of Sri Tyagaraja Swami on January 18, which was broadcast live by the All India Radio through its four stations in Andhra Pradesh. On Pushya Bahula Panchami (January 15), observed as the Punya Thithi of Sri Tyagaraja Swamy, the artists participated in Nagara Sankeerthana, a procession with the Panchaloha idols of Anjaneya Swamy and Sri Tyagaraja Swamy.
