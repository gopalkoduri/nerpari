VManasa Nayana sang under\u000athe auspices of Bharathi\u000aSthree Samaja, Mysore, as\u000apart of Ramanavami Celebrations.\u000aThe young singer created\u000aa healthy musical\u000aatmosphere where the listeners\u000afind themselves merged in the\u000aimports of the lyrics.Starting with "Sarasijanabha"\u000a(Varna - Atta - Swathy Thirunal/\u000aVadivelu) he built a good\u000aconcert following a tempo falling\u000abetween vilamba and madhyama\u000akaalas. The importance he gave\u000afor clear accents, and pauses he\u000aprovided, rendered the compositions\u000acomprehendible and enjoyable.Janaki Ramana ("Shudhasimanthini"\u000a- Thyagaraja) was one\u000asuch composition, which he sang\u000awith dedication and commitment.\u000aEven with a short alapana,\u000ahe enticed the audience by\u000ablending shades characteristic\u000aof Malahari and Thodi, reaching\u000aperceptible heights. Passages of\u000aimaginatively framed swarakalpanas\u000acomplemented the composition,\u000athough it appeared\u000aprotracted.In general, the elaborations\u000awere scholarly and methodical,\u000ayet, could have been more\u000arefined and proportionate: sancharas\u000ain the higher octaves did\u000anot favour the melodic aspects.The violin accompanist, H.M.\u000aSmitha complemented the\u000asinger's endeavours with relevant\u000aimpromptu passages. Percussionists,\u000aG.S. Ramanujan\u000a(mridanga) and Ramesh (ghata)\u000aexhibited their competence in a\u000apleasing thaniyavarthana.Other highlights were "Bhajare\u000aManasa" (Abheri - Vasudevacharya),\u000a"Thavadhasoham"\u000a(Punnaagavaraali - Thyagaraja)\u000aand others.Gayathri Girish sang under\u000athe auspices of Shri Ramaseva\u000aMandali Charitable Trust (Ramanavami\u000aconcerts). C.N.\u000aChandrashekhar (violin), G.S.\u000aRamanujam (mridanga) and\u000aV.S. Ramesh (ghata) accompanied\u000athe artiste.Resilient voice endowed with\u000asilvery timbre traversed with\u000aease in all the required three\u000aoctaves. With an appreciable\u000afluency, and composure ruling\u000athe general approach, her lyrical\u000apresentations stood for the\u000aintended meanings and emotive\u000aaspects.Vilambakaala compositions\u000aspoke more of the artiste's\u000aversatility and expertise. "Sami\u000aNinne Nammina" (varna - Patnam\u000aSubrahmanya Iyer/ Shatkaala\u000aNarasayya), carrying with\u000ait instantly revealing majesty\u000aand compactness, at once\u000amarked the terseness and competence\u000athe artiste inhered.Nevertheless, instead of tagging\u000aswarakalpanas to the varna,\u000awhich already incorporated\u000asuch similar strains; she could\u000ahave embellished "Sithapathi\u000aNa Manasuna" (Khamach-\u000aThyagaraja) with a few such\u000aswara passages for a better\u000abalance.She elaborated "Maa Janaki"\u000a(Kamboji - Thyagaraja) and\u000a"Rama Rama Gunaseema"\u000a(Simhendramadhyama -\u000aSwathy Thirunal). Of the two,\u000aalapana in Kamboji accredited\u000athe violinist; and Simhendramadhyama\u000areached near-completeness\u000afilled with both the\u000aragabhava and the swarabhava,\u000aevidencing mainly the singer's\u000amettle.Lyrics of Swathy Thirunal\u000acame alive when she expanded\u000athe charana at "Munimanasadhama"\u000aappending it with swarakalpanas\u000a- her manodharma,\u000amajestically unfurled into absorbing\u000aartistry: rhythm-patterns\u000aand swara-phrases ideally\u000aserving the overall mood.The artistic fervour that the\u000aaudience hitherto enjoyed, extended\u000ainto the thani avarthana\u000athat followed. "Yamanalla Rama"\u000a(Shivaranjani - Purandaradasa),\u000a"Shri Madhava"\u000a(Behag-Papanasham Shivan)\u000aand "Mudhugaare Yashodha"\u000a(Kuranji - Annamacharya) were\u000aother highlights.
