VSwetha Venkatesh sang at Ganabharathi in Mysore accompanied by H.S. Thandava Murthy (violin) and Radhesh (mridanga). Her voice is pleasing and resilient but short of subtle inflections. It can span easily over the octaves, particularly in the higher ones. Her competence revealed more finer aspects of singing commensurate with the concert gaining momentum.She presented varna, &#8220;Vanajakshiro&#8221; (Kalyani - Poochi Shrinivasa Iyengar) in two speeds. A slower initial tempo was desirable for better clarity in akaraas, and this would have kept at bay an impression that the progression was a little bit hurried. The concert was relatively more dynamic than absorbing: yet, not in any way subjected to flashy feats. Style was gentle though the delineations needed more refinement.Consider either &#8220;Dhanyudevvado&#8221; (Malayamarutha - Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer (featuring a meaningful neraval at &#8220;Varamardala&#8221;) or &#8220;Ne Morabettithe&#8221; (Thodi &#8211; Rupavathi &#8211; Tyagaraja - featuring a neraval at &#8220;Thapamokatonara&#8221; and a Thani Avarthana).In the expatiation of the above ragas, the singer unfurled with ease all the characteristic features well- wrapped in melodic tonal qualities. Nevertheless, particular moods, which one expected did not emerge satisfactorily.The main reason for the above shortcoming was inadequate attention paid to the importance of slower movements, thereby depriving the swaras and the swara phrases of their due emotive expressions. Radhesh&#8217;s approach to lyrics-oriented rhythm patterns cast a pleasing influence over the essence of the compositions. However, the violinist could not rise to the expected level on certain occasions.Other inclusions were &#8220;Anandaamrithakarshini&#8221; (Amrithavarshini - Muthuswamy Dikshitar), &#8220;Saarasadala Nayane&#8221; (Saaramati-Muthayya Bhagavathar), a tillana and so on.Anitha Satish, an artiste of tender age, gave a lively Bharathanatya performance at the Rotary West School. Interestingly, she is trained under the guidance of guru Sundara Swaminathan, California. All along, the artiste fully convinced the spectators of her competence and blooming into a mature artistry in the future.Intense practice has rendered her movements cute and fluent, though at times running short of technical precision in arriving at harmonic closes (consider, with due allowance to her age).The first two presentations - Pushpanjali and Jatiswara (Kalyani) projected her as having an admirable control in bringing about perceptible synchronisation between finer movements of both the anga and prathyangas. The gentle artiste described the vinyasas fully and assumed the postures gracefully.Her proficiency resulted in effecting an uninterrupted flow while connecting various elements of the choreographed sequences. For example, the manner in which she remarkably linked a series of alluring postures in &#8220;Ananda Thandavam Adinar&#8221; (Mohana). One could observe similar approaches in Varna (Chalamela &#8211;Natakuranji &#8211; &#8220;Mulaivittu Rangaswami Nattuvanar&#8221;) too.The pleasing expressions, particularly the expressive eyes, would have revealed moods of varied dimensions if the choreography had included elaborate sancharibhaavas in the varna. Further, performance for the pre-recorded music restricted the artiste from unfolding her imagination fully.&#8220;Saraswathi Namosthuthe&#8221; (Amrithavarshini) and tillana (Simhendra Madhyama) constituted other highlights.
