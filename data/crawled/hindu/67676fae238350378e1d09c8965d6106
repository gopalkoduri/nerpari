VGita Cassettes GCT  -   CDCL  -   239  -   Carnatic classical vocal  -   Padams and Javalis - Dr. Subhashini Parthasarathy -  Rs.125PADAMS AND Javalis are lustrous gems in the discipline of Carnatic Music that find favour with dancers, vocalists, instrumentalists and connoisseurs. The erotic lyrics depicting the sringara bhava and the beauty of the melodic content have a special appeal.The Dhanammal tradition that had internalised this delightful idiom, has handed the precious legacy to many among the following generations of musicians.Subhashini, a worthy disciple of the illustrious T. Muktha, is one such. Her CD for Gitaa cassettes consists of 14 compositions by Vaitheeswarankoil Subbarama Iyer, Dharmapuri Subbarayar, Chinnaiah, Papavinasa Mudaliar and Patnam Subramania Iyer. The songs in the  ragas Sahana, Kalyani, Kambhoji and in light classical ragas Behag and Yamunakalyani have been given melodic diction, clear expression that would benefit those who would like to add this genre to their repertoire with no hesitation of the authenticity of the patantaram.A. G. A.Gnanasundaram (violin), B.Ganapathiraman (mridangam) and Karthik (ghatam) are the very supportive accompanists. &#151;S.
