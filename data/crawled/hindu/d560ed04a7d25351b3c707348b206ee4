VKottapalli Vandana appeared to have one major mission in her 90-minute concert in the first afternoon slot on December 21, that is to strictly adhere to melody.Through Swati Tirunal's Mayamalavagowla piece, &#8216;Deva Deva' in Rupakam, she set the wheels of her recital rolling smoothly on briga-oiled bearings with niraval and kalpanaswaras on a 5-kattai base.Prayogas such as dha-pa, dha-ma, pa-ga, ri-ga-ma, &#8216;jaata-rosha' and imaginative korvais were simple, but caught the ear as it avoided the cliches and so drew spontaneous applause.Laudable effortK.V. Krishna on the violin showed ease and elegance. Too often one is a witness to the mere tala angle, with the attendant explosions that are played at the cost of melody. K. Ramesh, besides accompanying the singer and violinist, devised new patterns of sollus between parts of the 3-part compositions, modulating the three concluding arudis each time with emphasised and soft strokes.The delivery of Tyagaraja's &#8216;Padavini Sadbhakti' in Salakabhairavi, adi talam, was placid and tasteful. Vandana sailed through Poorvikalyani through flights of akaara sancharas effortlessly, balancing power and melody, supported by an equal measure of sweetness by Krishna.The composition &#8216;Padmavati-Ramanam Jayadevam' in misra chapu, was a pleasant surprise. &#8216;Rama Kusumamula' on a slow two-beat Sriragam was pacific. Tyagaraja's &#8216;Ninnada Nala Neerajaaksha' in raga Kannada marked a phase of sheer celebration through kalpanaswara among the three, sans the stridency.Aural pleasureIn a style characteristic of a thorough-going aesthete, she treated Khambodi- the main item of her recital, her unassuming effort pampering the aural buds. Krishna complemented it with a matching presentation, concluding with a tasteful stress on kaakilinishaada at the end.A committed rendition of &#8216;O Rangasayee' followed by niraval and kalpanaswaras at &#8216;Bhooloka Vaikuntha' set the seal of spirituality on this phase. K. Ramesh's serene five-minute thani made it appear longer than that, leaving listeners wanting more.The group turned out to be a very refined one, where the musicians admirably tuned their individual trademark talents to one wavelength. The concert ended with the inspired rendering of Papanasam Sivan's &#8216;Enna Tavam Seidanai'.
