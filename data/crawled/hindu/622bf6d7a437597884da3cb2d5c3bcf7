VS.SIVAKUMARRupa Mahadevan sang for the Padma Sarangapani Cultural Academy, at the Kalasagaram Hall (Villivakkam). Her raga alapanas for Varali (`KaVaVa,' Sivan) and Kiravani (`Kaligiyunte,' Tyagaraja) had genuine class, obviously built over the years.Rupa's selection included `Sri Mahaganapathe' (Abhogi, N.S.Ramachandran) and `Parvathi Kumaram' (Nattakurinji, Dikshitar). Niraval and swara singing were done as well as a serious pupil of music could have.A sculpture, as it is being worked, would warrant different levels of the eye and imagination. The same applies to a raga alapana too. Rupa's expositions would be even better if she artistically incorporates a few dhurita kala prayogas that would make the effort aesthetically complete.Anuthama Subramaniam on the violin accompanied with purpose and presented tidy versions of Varali and Kiravani. Thillaisthanam Suryanarayanan on the mridangam was at his rhythmic best during the thani and accompanied with a sense of comfort.It was also announced that Rupa was a Fulbright scholar and has won awards for her raga alapana skills. The concert which was scheduled to begin at 5 p.m, could commence only at 5.25. Rupa was also afforded a third accompaniment during the entire concert, apart from the violin and the mridangam, in the form of a perennial mike-menace. A strange squeaking sound always emanated from the audio device. One pat for the organisers for their enthusiasm in organising concerts in such "music-less" areas.Bottom Template Starts
