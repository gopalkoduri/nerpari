VKeeping up with its objective of  organising a music concert every second Sunday, Sangeetha Janakulam featured a veena recital by M. Veerabhadra Rao, former professor of Department of Music, BHU, M. Veerabhadra Rao  in the prayer hall of Sri Raghavendraswamy Temple.A versatile artiste, Rao not only imparts training in vocal music, he plays  flute, harmonium, keyboard, violin and veena and also gives carnatic music  recitals  on all the above instruments.He chose a rather strange and incompatible support on keyboard by his disciple Master B. Karthik. The rhythmic support was, of course, provided  on the mridangam by G. Venkata Rao.After starting withNavaraagamalika varnam, he renderedVaataapiganapathimbhaje (Hamsadwani)concluding it withswaram,Naadatanumanisam (Chittaranjani),Sarasasamadaana(Kaapi Narayani), brief elaborations ofSamajavaragamana (Hindolam),Gnanamosagaradaa (Purvi Kalyani),Sringaaralahari (Neelambari)withswarakalpanaas an extension of the inbuiltchittaswaramandO Jagadamba (Ananda Bhairavi)were his other songs.The dexterous play, with charming individual felicity , by both on their respective instruments was conspicuously a delightful feature of the concert. Veerabhadra Rao perhaps could impress better, sans the support on the keyboard as the contrasting tone of the instruments seemed to have got negatively modified by each other.Over and above this, continuity of the flow ofgamakaand coherence in the expression ofmanodharmasuffered a lot in the process. Overall, it rather turned out to be an event of wasted talent.Kulapathi and founder president of the Janakulam, IVL Sastry, introduced the artistes and proposed a vote of thanks.A. R.
