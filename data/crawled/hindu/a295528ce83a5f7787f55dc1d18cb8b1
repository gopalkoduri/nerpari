VDharwad is set to host Sangeetotsav, a three-day music festival from December 3. The event, which is open for all, has been organised as a befitting tribute to legendary sitar maestro late Rahimat Khan on his 56 {+t} {+h} death anniversary.The event will witness the grand confluence of renowned musicians of India and the audience will get a rare opportunity to enjoy their music. While event will focus mainly on Hindustani classical music, the special feature will be the duet (jugalbandi) by Hindustani sitarist Shafique Khan from Dharwad and renowned Carnatic violin player C. N. Chandrashekhar from Bangalore. Hindustani vocalists Dhananjay Hegde, Arshad Ali, Raghunandan Panshikar and Veena Sahasrabuddhe and flautist Ronu Majumdar and sarod artiste Abhishek Lahiri will perform at the event.The venue is Srijana hall, Karnatak College Campus.***Even 56 years after his demise name Rahimat Khan is fresh in the minds of music lovers. While the older generation is nostalgic about his enthralling sitar concerts, for the youth artists he is an inspiration. Born in a music family in 1863, he was the second son of Gulaam Hussain Khan, a vocalist in the court of Bhavanagar. Though he gained equal proficiency in singing and the sitar, he chose sitar and achieved mastery over the instrument.Ustad Rahimat Khan's greatest achievement is the invention of the new sitar that has brought about revolutionary changes in the field of instrumental music. In those days, the sitar was smaller in size and alaap, jod, badhat, jhala were not possible. Ustad Khan's innovative mind set to work to overcome this drawback. A realignment of the strings made for increased melody, flexibility and variety. Now the sitar could perform all that the been and the surbahar did. Thus was born today's sitar complete with four Saptakas.His concerts with the new sitar in Mumbai and Pune captured the hearts of all music lovers and connoisseurs. Krishnaraj Wodeyar IV, the Maharaja of Mysore, invited Khan saheb for a concert in 1911. Though Maharaja invited him to be at his court, Khan saheb preferred to settle down in Dharwad that has attracted him very much. He lived here from 1912 to 1954, till his death.He started the Bharatiya Sangeeta Vidyalaya at Dharwad in 1931. Rahimat Khan's style was a fine blend of the melody of Beenkar Gharana, the high seriousness and infallible layakari of Gwalior Gharana coupled with the gayaki ang , which came to be known as Rahimat baaz.Music was everything for the ustad. When someone unwittingly asked him what his religion was, &#8220;Music is my religion&#8221;.
