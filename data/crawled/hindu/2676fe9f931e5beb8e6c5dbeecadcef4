VThe concert of Saswathy Prabhu at the Krishna Gana Sabha was characterised by an ascetic pursuit of the calming quality of music without any superficial ornamentation. The credit for her expressional equanimity arose from her concern for simplistic clarity. Interpretation of kirtanas and elaboration of alapanas were correctly focussed on these objectives.The movement of raga vinyasa of Shanmukhapriya, &#8216;Kumara Guruguha Paadamey' and Mohanam, &#8216;Evaroora,' was smooth with manodharma directed to this ideal. Through her voice modulation she made them soft and flexible. In patantara purity she emphasised she has been well schooled in music's values.Well thought outFlowing lines marking the tracery of gentle sancharas were not impulsive but well thought out. The step-by-step development of both Mohanam and Shanmukhapriya was animated by this sentiment. So the ragas gained pleasing shape keeping clear of present day methods.The overall impression of her recital was it was plain in appearance, unaffected and unsophisticated.The thrust of Saswathy's programme was the choice of good kirtanas &#8211; &#8216;Ganamurthey' (Ganamurthi), &#8216;Balakrishnam Paada Malar' (Dhanyasi), &#8216;Durga Devi' (Navarasakannada), capped at the end by &#8216;Akhilandeswari' (Dwijavanti). In handling these items her style was free from pretence of erudition. The appeal rested mainly on the articulation of the sahitya with clarity.The accompanists, Srilakshmi Venkataramani (violin) B. Sivaraman (mridangam) and N. Sundar (tabla), toed the vocalist's mood. The harmony of the concert depended on the understanding teamwork.
