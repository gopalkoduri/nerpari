VB. RAMADEVIMalladi Brothers Sreerama Prasad and Ravi Kumar were featured in the monthly musical concert, `Eppadi Paadinaro,' organised by Sri Krishna Sweets at the Pravachana Mandapam, Kodandaramar Koil, Coimbatore.The impressive torrent of music started flowing with the pleasing Nattakkurinji varnam, ``Chalamela Jesevaiya.""Vasudevayani'' in Kalyani by Tyagaraja popped out unexpectedly  but the neraval for ``Raga Tala Gathulanu'' and the lilting swaraprastharas brought out the full form of the raga. Ravikumar's brief alapana in Vasantha opened the curtain for the stately ``Ramachandram Bhavayami'' by Dikshitar.Sreerama  took up the rare raga, Naasika Bhushani for alapana and depicted her in all her beauty and richness.SatisfyingFollowing this Dikshitar's ``Srirama Saraswathi'' was presented in a thoroughly satisfying manner. The brothers sang Syama Sastri's ``Marivere Gathi'' in Anandabhairavi, in a leisurely manner savouring each phrase and swara. ``Sevikka Vendumayya'' in Andholika was crisp. Todi unfolded herself like a flower, petal by petal, in the rich voice of Ravikumar and filled the hall with her fragrance.T. H. Subramanian's violin was magical. The ease with which he brought out the swarupa of the ragas was remarkable.The brothers sang ``Kadhanu Vaariki'' by Tyagaraja with due respect to the kriti and the raga. Mridangam by N. Ramakrishnan was impressive and enjoyable and Kovai Suresh proved his mettle with equal vigour.After the sumptuous feast, the dessert session followed. ``Manasa Sanchara Re'' (Saama) was soft while ``Ramachandrudu Raghuveerudu'' (Dwijavanthi) had a foot-tapping beat. ``Rama Rama Rama Seetha Ramana'' (Huseni) was devout while "Madhava Mamava Deva'' (Neelambari) was soothing.The tasteful selection of the songs and the energetic way in which they were sung made the audience yearn for more. The rhythmic mangalam by Badrachala Ramadas, ``Ramachandraya'' made sure that the spirit of the concert was retained till the end.Bottom Template Starts
