VNagur Babu deserves more opportunities to be able to settle down as a promising artisteSujanaranjani, a music sabha, managed by some musicians, to cater to the needs of the music lovers of West Hyderabad, organised  a flute recital by up and coming flautist Nagur Babu, at Sanathnagar's Hanuman Devasthanam temple complex recently. He was accompanied by S.V. Ramanamurthy on violin and Gunaranjan on mridangam.Nagur Babu openedNatakuranji varnamrevealing his style of play concentrating more on melodic lilt sans any break in the blowing technique, moving fingers appropriately on the flute holes to get the continuity of sound, at different levels. He then went for invocatoryMahaganapathiminNataof Dikshitar, playing it with devotional touch. Then followed the popular numberEndaro MahanubhavuluinSri. This particular piece put to view his technical skills again. And equally important was theNagumomuinAbheri. The raga essay was elaborate enough to exhibit the beautiful moves of the raga that get reflected in the song part too.  The compositionNagumomuby itself is a wonderful lyrical expression that moves up totarasthayiand Nagurbabu concentrated well in these parts to give out the lyrical beauties and their setting in musical phrases. He presentednereval, which too delved on the sahitya part. Theswarakalpanathat followed had some variegated rhythmic patterns giving good exercise to the mridangist Gunaranjan. The percussionist proved himself a perfect hand and added his own skills to elevate the image of the concert further. So did violin player Ramanamurthy in playing the ragas, in his turn, with complementary touches to add to the full picture of the raga, especially inAbheri, the main melody of the concert. This piece turned out to be the highlight.The latter part of the concert had Annamacharya'sOkaparikokapariset to music by Nedunuri Krishnamurthy inKharaharapriya. This proved a pleasant devotional dedicated to Lord Venkateswara. Then came another devotional of Purandaradas inSindhu Bhairavi. AKhamasJavali concluded the flautists' impressive show that was well received. Nagur Babu, who is the disciple of Nagaraju a noted name, deserves more opportunities to be able to settle down as another promising artiste in this rare field.G.S.Bottom Template Starts
