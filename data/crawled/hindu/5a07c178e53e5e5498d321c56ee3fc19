VSankaran Namboothiri provided rasikas in Palakkad a musical treat as he rendered a mix of rare and popular  compositions.  Namboothiri has created a niche for himself in the world of music with his melodious and pliable voice  that is perfectly aligned to shruti.Namboothiri began his concert with Harikesanallore Muthiah Bhagavathar&#8217;s &#8216;Sakthiganapathim bhajeham&#8217; in Natta, which was decorated with brilliant swarakalpana.Swati composition &#8216;Pahi Sreepathe Mohanamoorthe&#8217; in raga Hamsadhwani was followed by an erudite alapana of Saraswati and the kriti &#8216;Sadaramava.&#8217; &#8216;Neeve nannubrovalanamma,&#8217; a composition of Valajappetta Venkitaramana Bhagavathar in Darbar, set to Khandhachapputhala, had interesting swaraprasthara.A rendition of Kalyani showcased his command over classicism. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Bhajanaseyave oh manasa&#8217; in Roopaka tala had elaborate swarasanchara. Two brisk and lilting pieces &#8211; &#8216;Parakelanannu paripalimpa&#8217; of Shyama Sastri in Kedargoula and &#8216;Ninnujoochi Dhanyutaithi&#8217; of Pattanam Subrahmania Iyer in raga Sourashtra &#8211; was followed by the highlight of the evening, a detailed exploration of the raga Madhyamavathi.His interpretation was rich in bhava. &#8216;Pannagasayana Padmanabha Paripalayamam,&#8217; composed by Muthuswami Dikshitar, was  embellished with a well articulated niraval at &#8216;Unnatha Pandhya Kerala nivasa&#8230;&#8217; and had kalpanaswara laced with korvais.Edapally Ajith (violin), Kuzhalmannam Ramakrishnan (mridangam) and Manjoor Unnikrishnan (ghatom) provided excellent musical support.Edapally Ajith&#8217;s melting delineation of Kalyani and Madhyamavathi were rich in  melodic sancharas. The percussion ensemble of Kuzhalmannam Ramakrishnan and Manjoor Unnikrishnan was superb.A couple of light musical numbers and a patriotic &#8216;Jyathi jayathi Bharathamatha&#8217;  in Kamas and a bhajan were rendered in the latter half of the concert. Namboothiri wound up the concert with a rare thillana of Swati Tirunal in Bhoopala.The concert, organised by Swaralaya, Palakkad, was held at M.D.R. Memorial Hall.
