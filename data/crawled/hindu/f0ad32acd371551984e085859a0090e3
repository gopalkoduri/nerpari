VT.N. Krishnan and his younger sister N. Rajam, playing under the auspices of Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha, took the packed hall  to the lofty realms of Indian classical music.TNK began, in his &#8216;gaayaki&#8217; style,  raga Hamsadhwani, which  migrated to the North through Marathi stage music. Rajam, focussing on its soft contours, bowed on to draw a vivid picture of the raga. &#8216;Vathapi&#8217; flowed from the violin of TNK, when his sister played a &#8216;Khyal&#8217; with dainty sweeps and glides.It was  not surprising to hear  a master violinist, who has accompanied almost all the stalwarts of the past, echoing their characteristic touches when rendering the ragas. The first part of Kalyani  had flourishes that were typical of GNB but the  latter part reminded listeners of  the &#8216;Navarasa&#8217; bhani of Semmangudi. &#8216;Thaanam,&#8217; pepped up by a pallavi, consisting of Desh and Kanada, had a  melodic layout.Rajam countered it with Yaman as the main raga and then Desh.  They rounded it off with &#8216;Vageswari Kanada&#8217; and a tinge of &#8216;Jaijaivanthi.&#8217;  Hindolam (Malkauns) and Sindhu Bahiravi or Bhairavi of the North was depicted through Swati Tirunal&#8217;s  &#8216;Visweswara,&#8217; which was presented by the duo in tandem.Guryvayur Dorai showed how to give accompaniment to instrumental concerts by virtue of Chaappu, which was meshed with a variety of tonal inflexions of the Ghumki.The &#8216;parans&#8217; and &#8216;tekhas&#8217; by Ravindra Yavagal on the tabla blended  sweetly with the bass on the &#8216;bayan&#8217;(left-hand drum).
