VGUDIPOODI SRIHARIThe Priya Sisters we heard a year ago are quite different from what they are now.  Today, they appear to be more  accomplished singers. Their concert held at Ravindra Bharati as part of the two-day Icfai Music Festival-2007, which was sponsored by Alpha Foundation and the South Indian Cultural Association ,was an experience to listen.It was one of the most wonderful concerts seen in the  recent times.  Of the two, the elder one Shanmukhapriya displayed a kind of sobriety and serenity.   As for the younger sister Haripriya, the way she carries herself shows how dashing and knowledgeable she is.  And the two make an excellent combination  with complementary qualities.While Shanmukhapriya sang with aplomb reflecting erudition, Haripriya was vivacious and took risk  whenever displayed  hermanodharma, especially while building theragaandswara.In richragas,she displayed her urge to bring out the best with an authoritative touch. The fact that none in the  well-packed auditorium moved out  even while thetani avartanamwas on explains how good the concert was. Every raga they rendered and shared was itself a sumptuous essay worth remembering.The repertoire was a combination of Tamil and Telugu compositions. The initial part of the concert was marked by a pleasantHindolam, for which they chose a Tamil composition in praise of Vinayaka as an invocation. Then came theBhairaviessay, which was well presented through the  popularUpacharamuchese Varunnarainrupakam, along with a well-measuredswarakalpana. Then  they went for a Tamil compositionKaa Vaa VaainVarali,before they took up a rare ragaLalitha,which was well essayed. ThekritiNannu Brovu Lalithaof Shyama Sastry was rendered  with good expression in such a way that  every word clear was to the audience. The rendition of this devotional number was a bit animated too. Theswarakalpanawas built  with utmost care and retained  the melodic mood intact.That was  followed by a quickieNiravadhi SukhadainRavichandrika. Haripriya rendered the majorraga Kalyaniexclusively, which  took a good time, and each phrase of the melody was decorated with nuances of high order.   They chose  Dikshitar's Sanskrit pieceKamalambam Bhajareinchowka talam.This was one ofNavavarna kritisof the saint composer. Together withneravalandswarakalpana,the rendition of this major piece took almost one hour to complete. It was, of course, the best offering of the duo. They were  supported  by Chennai Raghavendra Rao on violin and Satish Kumar on mridangam . Thetani avartanampresented by both was a thrill that made the audience sit and enjoy every bit of it. Even the  light classical lullaby of AnnamayyaSriranga Sisuvu Jo Jowas a pleasure  to listen to. The concert was concluded withGovindam Gokulanandam.Bottom Template Starts
