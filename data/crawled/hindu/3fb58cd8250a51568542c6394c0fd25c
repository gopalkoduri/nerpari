VAs a part of its weekly concerts, Nada Bharathi featured a vocal recital by Kaivalya Kumar. Kaivalya displayed skill in his recital, with his rich voice and flair forbirka sangathis.Kaivalya began with a refreshing varnam of Lalgudi in Adi. He took up Bhairavi for Deekshitar&#8217;sSari Evaarammain Khanda Jathi Jhampe talam which is a rare item these days. This krithi was bit heavy for the initial stage of the concert, as it usually comes in the middle of the concert. A brief Hameer Kalyani was hummed for another Deekshitar&#8217;s compositionPurahara Nandana, another rare item, which was nicely done.Sujanajeevanaramain Khamas of Thyagaraja was done at a faster pace than usual but had the clarity. Hindolam was taken for a detailed rendition with good ragabhavam.Here, Kaivalya tried to experiment with the Hindustani version with speedybirka sangathisand went on to sing Mysore Vasudeva Charya&#8217;sMamavatu Sri Saraswathiin Adi with feebly-appearing swarakalpana.Parakela Ninnuin Kedaragowla was a good choice and was sung well.Pancha Shatpeeta Rupiniin Karnataka Devagandhari was another punched-up item, before Kaivalya went on to the main attraction of the concert. Sankarabharanam was detailed for an essay in which the artiste travelled from the lower octaves to the higher with flashybirka sancharas. On the whole he managed the ragam well, although leaving scope for a better performance. Thyagaraja&#8217;sEduta Nilache, another uncommon number, was neatly presented with soft swarakalpana rendered with right attitude.Young Pavan on the violin did well to keep up with the vocalist by giving an improvised performance. Kaivalya tried a viruthham in Hamsanandi, Desh and Sindhubhairavi and his attempt was appreciable.Rama ramain Sindhubairavi was followed by a Hindi bhajan in Yaman and concluded with an Annamacharya compositionEduta unnadu veedi.On the whole Kaivalya showed good spirit in his performance and proved the point that he can be a good competitor.
