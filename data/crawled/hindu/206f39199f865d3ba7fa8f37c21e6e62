VThat they were not taking any chances trying anything innovative was evident in both the main elements of the concert &#8212;Madhyamavati (Aadaadhu asangathu) and Thodi (Karthikeya). The alapana of the former was rendered by Kala and the latter by Chitra. In either case, violinist Kallidaikurichi Balakrishnan, outclassed the vocalists in both aesthetics and creativity.However, the vocalists did provide an enjoyable fare, with swaras at Unai adivarum azagha in Madhyamavathi and niraval and swaras at Mal maruga Shanmukha in the Thodi piece. One got an impression that the singers were in need of some cheerleaders to perform better.The other elements of the concert were &#8216;Brovavamma&#8217; (Manji), &#8216;Mohanakara&#8217; (Neethimathi) and &#8216;Om Namo Narayana&#8217; (Karnaranjani).These were neatly presented, although the shutshruthi &#8216;da&#8217; in the Neethimathi piece underlying the &#8216;ra&#8217; in the word &#8216;Srikara&#8217; in the composition, should have been raised a bit to give the rendition the proper vivadhi flavour.Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar on the mridangam provided unobtrusive percussive support and a short tani.
