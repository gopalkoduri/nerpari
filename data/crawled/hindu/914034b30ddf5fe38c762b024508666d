VAmong several Carnatic music concerts during the recent Sri Ramanavami Music Festival at Mysore, few concerts were impeccable. The violin duo of M.S. Gopalakrishnan and his daughter Narmada at Sri Rama Seva Samithi Charitable Trust, V. V. Mohalla, and Vidwan Vijaya Siva at Bidaram Prasanna Seetharama Mandira were lively performances with scholarly presentation and inspiring melody. The proud lineage was evident in their approach to raga bhava and svarakalapana. The melodious tristayi-sanchari with enthralling clarity of gamakas, crisp kalapana savaras in raga Begada ("Shankari Neeve") by Narmada, was captivating. Delineation of two poignant ghana-ragas Mohana and Kalyani, blended as Mohana Kalyani by both the artistes delighted listeners.  Durbar ("Yochana Kamala Lochana"), Sriranjani ("Bhuvani Dasuduni"), Veera Vasantha ("Emani Pogadudu") were inspired.  The oscillating melody and dexterity of mridangam by Rajakeshari illuminated the concert.ClassyVijaya Siva's vocal concert at Bidaram Sri Rama Mandira was a remarkable performance. His development of Bhairavi with Dixitar's "Balagopala" was outstanding. "He Gopalaka-He Kripajalanidhe" and neraval in the charana "Manikya-Makuta-Hara" enhanced the euphony of the raga.The other compositions he chose were those of Sri Tyagaraja and Swathi Tirunal Maharaj.It is relevant to mention that response to the concerts by local talents at the other venues was encouraging.B.S.S.
