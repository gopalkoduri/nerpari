VA.R. Rahman continues to be on song. For long we have been waiting for something called a complete album. Music composers used to crib: where are the situations? Here it is, folks. From classical to pop to aarti to marriage number to sufi, the album seamlessly blends all with conviction and boundless energy. Rahman proves with &#8220;Masakali&#8221; that frivolous could be convincing.Mohit Chauhan has taken the fun number to a different level with his range and earnestness. It is not an easy song but Mohit has done full justice to the nuances that Rahman has conceived.He has found an able companion in Prasoon Joshi, who knows Delhi too well to bring the flavour of the Walled City in his words. It reflects in &#8220;Arziyaan&#8221; beautifully rendered by Javed Ali and Kailash Kher and &#8220;Rehna Tu&#8221; where Rahman comes in as a singer. The icing on the cake is &#8220;Genda Phool&#8221;, a marriage song provided by actor Raghubir Yadav. You get the feel of your mother and sisters singing it. Again it is a difficult composition made simple by Rahman. Rekha Bharadwaj is the perfect choice for such compositions. She fills in with traditional aarti as well. For the young and happening there is &#8220;Dilli 6&#8221;, where Blaaze and Tanvi make Old Delhi one with the world. And for the romantic hopelessly immersed in love there is &#8220;Dil Gira Daftan&#8221;. Go for it!It is not often that we get classical Urdu poetry in ghazal form these days. But here is a priceless CD from Sa Re Ga Ma that brings the ghazals of Asadullah Khan Ghalib, Momin and Jaan Nisar Akhtar together. With some soulful rendering by Talat Aziz, the vastly under-utilised talented artiste, the album marks a rare foray by Sonu Nigam into ghazals. He has rendered Ahmed Faraz&#8217;s &#8220;Qurbaton Mein Bhi&#8221; with the flair of a natural.The nine ghazal album opens with &#8220;Asar usko zara nahin hota&#8221; by Momin. Then there is the peerless Ghalib with his &#8220;Dil se Teri Nigah&#8221;. However, the favourite for all die-hard romantics has to be Akhtar&#8217;s &#8220;Humse Bhaga Na Karo Ghazalo ki Tarah&#8221;.Go for it. It is soulful. It is timeless.
