VG.SWAMINATHANAn enviably masculine voice, youth, a musically inclined family background, good grasp of the chosen medium, creditable manodharma &#151;  all these are factors in favour of Palghat R. Ramprasad. But unbridled speed tends to cloud the quality of his music.  It is accepted that brisk pace is  mandatory for a concert. But it should not end up creating  a vocal pell-mell. When finesse is sacrificed while going on a fast track, the musician must pause to restore balance.In fact, Ramprasad's Saveri varnam and a rather   sedate `Sokasugamridanga' in Sriranjani (Tyagaraja) took off only at the distributed swara segment in `Sokasuga', `Mridanga' and `Talamu.' The excess dosage of frantic akaras in the Vachaspati alapana and the wildly chased neraval and swaras at `Alla nadu Sowmitri' of `Kandajoodumi' (Tyagaraja) were indeed a put off.But, is Ramprasad really relying on this style? No. He gleaned fetching phrases of Dhanyasi followed by Syama Sastri's `Meenalochani Brova.' Later, once again he underpinned the supple moves of Keeravani for Tyagaraja's `Kalikiyunde' to the best advantage. The exposition was quite tranquil and enough time had been provided to build the raga structure with profundity.Soft reposesThe better part of Keeravani alapana was suffused with soft reposes, smooth and glossy glides. Surprisingly, the neraval at `Baguga Sriraghu' was terminated without kalpanaswaras making way for tani avaratanam.Ramprasad's grip over kalpanaswaras is commendable.  But the galloping spree spoils the whole effect as fast delivery of the syllables after a point just reduces the music to babble.The extended tani avartanam with double mridangam by Rajamani and Trivandrum Balaji was done with delicacy without din. Rajaram's violin accompaniment turned out to be just sufficient.The concert was for Asthika Samajam, Amarabharati,  Thriuvanmiyur.  . The venue had the expected shortcomings of a marriage hall converted into a concert auditorium with an additional problem of free flying moths.Bottom Template Starts
