VYadukula KambojiSankari KrishnanRajalakshmi Audio (CD)Carnatic classical vocal (Rs. 300)The melody and rakti of Yadukulakamboji epitomise a wide range of emotions musically such as bhakti, dignity, authority, compassion and spirit, all reinforced with a bhava-laden bearing.Sankari Krishnan, an accomplished vocalist, has recorded two CD albums that comprise several compositions by various composers including a pada varnam by Thanjavur Vadivelu, and a rare tillana in khanda triputa by Ramanathapuram Srinivasa Iyengar, all in Yadukulakamboji."Celimini Jalajakshu" (Tyagaraja) and "Kalai Thooki" of Marimutha Pillai in praise of the Dancing Lord at Ponnambalam are soft, soothing versions.The singer's alapana of the raga is dotted by age old and classical `pidis' that do not strictly conform to grammar, yet without which it could have a colourless, lacklustre gait.The diamond in the diadem of Subbaraya Sastri's repository, "Ninnu Sevinchina" with its fascinating chittaswaram and appropriate brief swaraprastharas true to the maxim, "in art economy is always beautiful," adequately reflects quality.Melodic heightsSeiyur Sengalvaraya Sastri's "Lalithe Mampahi," a Sambandar Thevaram and Muthiah Bhagavathar's Themmangu scale considerable melodic heights.Syama Sastri's swarajathi, "Kamakshi" panegyrising his `Ishta Deivam' Kamakshi with its swara sahitya passages and awe-inspiring gamaka nuances, is perhaps the ultimate in reflecting the beauty of Yadukulakamboji.Sankari scripts a very satisfactory interpretation.Ariyakkudi Ramanujam Iyengar was not only a trendsetter but also a tunesmith par excellence. "Yarendru Raghavanai" of Arunachala kavirayar with its appealing music attire, has been sung with elegance and involvement.Musiri Subramania Iyer's articulation of Tyagaraja's "Pahi Ramachandra" would immediately establish an ambience of repose and harmony.Sankari has done well to render the song with composure, creating a relaxed atmosphere.Ramanathapuram Srinivasa Iyengar's tillana and Swati Tirunal's "Bhujaga Sayino" are the tailpieces of these audio volumes that deserve permanent slots in the connoisseur's rack.The accompanists Embar Kannan (violin), J. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and Guruprasad (ghatam) play their roles with  panache.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
