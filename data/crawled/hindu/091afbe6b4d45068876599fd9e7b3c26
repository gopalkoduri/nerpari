VThe Rudra veena recital by Ustad Asad Ali Khan at the Mumbai session of the recently concluded Akashvani Sangeet Sammelan was notable for the highly artistic and scholarly rendering of the serene raga Puriya. The recital was in keeping with the style of his family&#8217;s traditions of the beenkaars of the illustrious Jaipur gharana.Raga Puriya is known for its melodic sobriety and its intricate form which has the common notes of the allied scales of ragas Marwa and Sohni. To steer away from the aromas of these two ragas and retain Puriya&#8217;s basic character calls for music of high order. The ustad delighted listeners by releasing a good number of hauntingly etched sequences with the intense melodic appeal of his masterly  glides (meend-soot). The concluding piece in the colourful raga Khamaj was rendered with intense sobriety and melodic charm with rich nuances of Dhrupad style which is entirely contrary to the manner in which the khayal and thumri singers render it. Full marks to Dalchand Sharma for his commendable pakhawaj accompaniment.Manju Mehta&#8217;s sitar recital at the Gwalior session was pleasing in parts. There were quite a few endearing sequences in her opening alap-jod and the gat-todas in raga Jogkauns.  One was  impressed with her neat handling of the sitar, particularly the frets and the strings. Her awareness of the rhythm with Ram Kumar Mishra of Varanasi was indeed good.Pandit Laxman Krishnarao Pandit&#8217;s vocal recital, also at Gwalior, revived some good old memories when music stalwarts would gather at the house of one of their colleagues or at a temple from midnight to dawn and perform. An earthen cup of tea and a couple ofpakodaswas all that the maestros and their admirers had for the entire session. Laxmanrao&#8217;s opening khayals in raga Durbari Kanada (Mubarakbad Shadiyaan) revived memories of his illustrious father and guru, the late Krishnarao Shanker Pandit, doyen of the Gwalior gharana.  Laxmanrao&#8217;s rendering had all the notable features of his illustrious father&#8217;s singing. Laxmanrao&#8217;s rendering of khayals in the hybrid melody of raga Shankara Bihag however failed to impress.The World Space Radio&#8217;s (WSR) Gandharva channel presented the well-known composition in raga Nat Bihag (&#8220;Jhan, Jhan, Than-jan Paayel Baaje&#8221;) sung by the late Mallikarjun Mansoor. This masterpiece is known to be one of the late Aaftab-e-Mausiqi (the shining son of music) the Ustad Fayaz Khan of Baroda. This was like some young painter of today attempting to draw on the lines of  Rembrant or Cezan. Himself a good singer though, Mansoor however could not match the standards set by the illustrious Aaftab-e-Mausiqi.Another WSR programme in the Marathi (Surabhi) channel had a charmingly rendered &#8220;Sanskoti Sarja&#8221; by Lata Mangeshker.
