VArtistes  are used to performing in full stage lights.  In theatre, cinema and dance  performances the auditorium lights  are switched off,  but for Carnatic music concerts the lights above the audience are not switched off.  At the Carnatic music concert under review, too, the lights above the audience were not switched off. But the stage lights had to be switched off, as  the seasonal insects that proliferate around this time of the year in northern parts of the country and buzz around any lighted object  started troubling the artistes. Thereafter, they virtually performed in normal lights which were dim. But their performance of close to three hours  had never a dim moment. Rather, it was strikingly sparkling.Sheik Mahaboob Subhani and his wife Kaleeshabi Mahaboob , popularly known as the &#8216;Nadaswaram Couple&#8217;, who participated in the 64th year Skanda Shashti Celebrations organised by Sree Swaminatha Swami Seva Samaj, presented a captivating  nagaswaram recital the other day at Malai Mandir. At a time when  nagaswaram concerts occupy very little space even in music festivals, the Samaj&#8217;s gesture of organising a full-fledged nagaswaram  concert during this festival every year is laudable.While presenting &#8220;Janani Ninuvina&#8221; in raga Riti Gowla (a composition of Subbaraya Sastri) and &#8220;Enta Bhagyamu&#8221; in Saranga (Tyagaraja&#8217;s composition) the bhavas of these ragas overflowed. The couple enthralled  listeners with a detailed presentation of Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8220;Thunaipurindharul&#8221; in raga Varamu, which is similar to the raga Hindolam except for a minor difference in the note Dhaivatam. Earlier, Kaleeshabi  presented an excellent delineation of this raga, bringing  the raga bhava to the fore. The couple subsequently  presented swaraprastaras rich in creativity.After the impressive fast paced &#8220;Saravanabhava Guhane&#8221; in the raga Kannada, the couple presented Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Nagumomu ganalena&#8217; in the raga Abheri. The couple brought  the raga as well as the sahitya bhava of this composition to the fore out of this instrument. In turns, they delineated the raga in stages bringing out its  complete essence. The raga Sahana also underwent similar treatment, before they presented yet another Tyagaraja composition, &#8220;Giripai Nelakonna&#8221;.The couple was ably assisted by Shankar and Anjaneyulu  who provided understanding support on the tavil. Their taniavartanam in Adi tala was also captivating. However, one felt  they could have presented the main item of their concert dedicated to Lord Kartikeya as they are participating in the Skanda Shashti festival. Nevertheless, this  nagaswaram concert will linger long in the memory.Yet another concert by  a big ticket artiste, who participated in the Parampara-2008 festival presented by Raja-Radha Reddy, will also linger long in the memory, albeit for the wrong reasons. Sudha Raghunathan who was given the time slot after an Odissi dance programme could only start her recital  after 8 p.m.. She wasn&#8217;t in  the finest of health either. Nor was her regular violin accompanist who could not make it for this reason. Settling with Delhi&#8217;s violinist Arvind Bharathi, Sudha&#8217;s concert lasted for just about an hour. There was a lot of hype about Sudha&#8217;s participation in this festival, but she fell terribly short of expectations and it was a disappointing performance. Ironically, Sudha concluded her concert with &#8220;Kuraivondrum illai&#8221;. The only saving grace was the mridangam accompaniment of Neyveli Skanda Subramanian. One hopes Sudha takes her Delhi rasikas a little more seriously in future.
