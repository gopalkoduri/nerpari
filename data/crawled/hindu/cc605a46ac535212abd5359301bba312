VRich tributes were paid to Rallapalli Anantakrishna Sarma, who was the first and foremost to think of Tallapaka Sankirtana literature by setting 108 compositions of the Tallapaka poets to music.The Tallapaka music was irretrievably lost and when found were just compositions available on copper plates with no musical notations. Rallapalli breathed musical life into them, by first publishing Alarulu Kuriyaga Aadenadhe in Raga Sankarabharanam with notations in Andhra Patrika in the year 1948. He published 49 kritis and the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) later brought out 108 songs into two volumes. Rallapalli's compositions were immortalised by great singers like M.S. Subbulakshmi, Mangalampalli Balamurali Krishna and Nedunuri Krishnamurthy among others. Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu played his songs on violin.Annamacharya Mission, a charitable trust established in 1999 to preserve and propagate the saint-poet's kritis and other devotional literature, observed Rallapalli's 95th birth anniversary on the premises of Sri Ramakrishna Seva Samithi in Tirupati on February 10, which coincided with the auspicious Ratha Sapthami festival at Tirumala. The event was observed under the guidance of the mission's founder President Kamisetty Srinivasulu, who as the then Director of the TTD's Annamacharya Project and was instrumental in bringing out 30 compositions of Annamacharya, to which musical notations were made by Rallapalli and Nedunuri. Later, Srinivasulu released the songs through the TTD's Sri Venkateswara Recording Project as its Director.Rallapalli's son R.A. Jayanta emotionally narrated the life and works of his father, while Kamisetty, a direct disciple of Sri Rallapalli, paid his tribute to Sangita Kalanidhi Rallapalli who was duly honoured by the TTD with the title Sangita Sahitya Vidwan. He also announced Rs.1 lakh for propagating Rallapalli's works.Singer G.Balakrishna Prasad gave a scintillating performance of the songs music-composed by Rallapalli such as Nagumogamu thoda (Malavi), Alarulu Kuriyaga (Sankarabharanam), Samanyama (Dhanyasi) and Brahma Kadigina (Mukhari), Parathathvambagu, Chakkani Thalliki (Padi) and Suvvi Suvvi (Kedaragowla). He was ably supported by Pudukkottai R.Ramanathan on violin and P.Balasubramanyam on Mrudangam.
