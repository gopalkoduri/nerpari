VT. K. GANAPATHYCrisp alapanas and total involvement highlighted Sumitra Nitin's flavoured concert on the fourth day of the Navaratri festival of music at Manoranjitham,  Sri Ayyappan Puja Sangham.Unnecessary gimmicks or sangatis are not her cup of tea. Her sedate presentation of the varnam, Sami, in Kannada was racy. A well-designed Anandabhairavi alapana, with appropriate sancharas, was captivating."Sankari Samkuru Chandramukhi" in Saveri compelled rapt attention.Her detailed essay of Bilahari and Kalyani was marked by all the standard prayogams. Though her akara singing was good, her interpretative punch was lacking.Amritha Murali's individual refinement on the violin came to the fore in alapanas with the use of attractive idioms and phrases that won all-round nods.Gopalakrishnan's mridangam accompaniment was quite supportive.DelectableWith his sweet and malleable voice, Gurucharan provided a delectable fare.  Exquisite manodharma and the nonchalant manner in which he displayed his musical impulses, especially in transferring the sanchara combinations from mandara sthayi to tara sthayi, was indeed a treat.His spirited opening of "Eranapai" varnam in Todi was followed by "Thunaipurundarul" in Varamu, "Bhajare Bhaja Manasa" and "Marupalga" in Sriranjani, creating a favourable impact.Aesthetic touchesHis raga vinyasams of Sreeragam, Dhanyasi and Suddhasaveri had all the formalities of raga structuring replete with aesthetic touches.The list included Giripriyam, Guha Shanmukha (Kosalam), "Erumayileri" in Baghesri and "Naan Oru Vilayattu" (Navarasakannada). His RTP exercise in Dharmavati for "Govindanadi Mukundanadi" revealed his good insight into the raga swaroopa.The strength of his tonal punch and vocal manipulation in the tara sthayi delighted the rasikas.Ambika Prasad (violin) and Vaidyanathan (mridangam) were the accompanists.Bottom Template Starts
