VAs is his wont, Gurucharan's meticulous homework for concert paddhathi paid him rich dividends in the vocal recital organised by Nadabrahma Gana Sabha, at Vanaprastha in Vadavalli, Coimbatore. His musical perception evidenced in the choice of numbers for the concert gripped the rasikas from the beginning.The rendition of &#8216;Ninnukkori' (Vasantha) was followed by &#8216;Sree Vatapi Ganapathiye' (Sahana) sung with a rich tapestry of swaras stressing the incisive phrasing of the kriti.His mellifluous sketch of Mukhari for the kriti, &#8216;Endraikku Siva Krupai' was a synthesis of music and rhythm.Unusual prayogasGurucharan's well-defined briga-laden raga contours of Brindavanasaranga, underscored by unusual prayogas and laya variations for the kriti, &#8216;Sri Ranga Puravihara,' brought out the rakti and ragaswaroopa mesmerising the audience.The presentations of &#8216;Niravadhisukhada' (Ravichandrika) and &#8216;Jagadoddharana' (Kaapi) were soulful. Balasubramanian's violin accompaniment was impressive.Prakash's splendid beats on the mridangam and his vibrant thani made the concert enjoyable.
