VK. C. ASOKNavarasam Sangeetha Sabha's 20th anniversary celebration at Chembai Memorial Hall in Thiruvananthapuram, recently, turned out to be an occasion for a captivating nadaswaram concert by Vettikavala K.N. Sasikumar. The tonal quality and depiction of ragas was a treat for the audience. The concert began with a crisp but impressive sanchara of Natta, followed by the kriti, `Saraseeruhasana priye.' The speedy `Makelara' in Chandrika preceded the slow-paced Shyama Sastri composition, `Janani ninuvina' in Reethigoula. Reethigoula was portrayed with panache bringing out itslakshana. The main raga, Kalyani (`Kamalamba' a Dikshithar kriti)  had some exquisiteprayogas.Sasikumar is an expert in `Jaru' (the ability to regulate breath while blowing the instrument so as to produce soft and loud tones), which help him play light ragas or tukkadas melodiously. The elaboration of raga Ahirbhairvi (`Bhipare rama rasam') was a veritable testimony to this. Kavadi chintu and `Sabari giri natha,' a devotional song were the concluding pieces.Avaneeswaram S.R. Vinu accompanied on his electric four-string violin. His was as comfortable on the instrument as he is on the ordinary violin and skilfully handled ragas such as Reetigoula, Kalyani and Ahirbhairavi. Anchal Krishna Iyer nimbly played the ghatom and Mangadu Jagadeendranon the mridangom.Bottom Template Starts
