VIt is highly gratifying to see Gayathri Venkataraghavan constantly evolving into a fine vocalist of merit through her steady focus on the sensitive and spiritual facets of our archaic music.Her vocal recital at Amarabharati, for Asthika Samajam,  Thiruvanmiyur, , highlighted her musical prudence and steady progression with discernment right from the choice of kritis and time management with no compromises on the quality. Gayathri&#8217;s dynamic start with &#8216;Paavani Ninnu Nera,&#8217; a varnam in Janaranjani by her guru A.Sundaresan trailed by &#8216;Ne Nendu Veda Gudura&#8217; in Karnataka Behag by Tyagaraja made space for the restful elucidation of Varali.Gayathri&#8217;s raga expositions become a delight as they express the concern the singer has for the raga bhava and her insight to select the ripe and resonant phrases set in continuum in presenting. The voice modulation and articulation were exploited in the right fraction exploring the dainty nuances of the raga chosen. There could not have been a better choice than &#8216;Karuna Joodavamma&#8217; of Syama Sastri to follow the alapana. &#8216;Syama Krishnudu Jagadini Bhagyame&#8217; set for niraval and swaras voted for strong emphasis on the serene quality of Varali.Sriragam, one of the elegant ragas of carnatic music, found special place in Gayathri&#8217;s  agenda. The vinyasa promptly bringing the signature phrases of Sri was a pleasure.Subbaraya Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Vanajasana Vinuta&#8217; and the swaras appended were minimal but expressive. The main slot was reserved for an excellently mounted Khambodi. In general, Khambodi shines better in the upper regions and with strident phrases among musicians. But Gayathri&#8217;s creative approach moved on the thoughtful and royal tracks making a best prelude to Veena Kuppaiyar&#8217;s magnum opus, &#8216;Koniyadina Napai.&#8217; The composition is one of the daunting but extraordinary numbers. The incredible and testing sangatis differentiated by subtle variations in the pallavi itself were projected neatly by Gayathri.The solid niraval at &#8216;Ninnu Minchina Deivamu Ledani&#8217; and the slick swara slice centered on &#8216;daivatam&#8217; carried zest. The best quality is that Gayathri&#8217;s kalpanaswaras also were imbued with the raga&#8217;s speciality without being just pile of excessive flat notes.Fast and exotic ragas like Suddha Saveri (&#8216;Arumuga Adimayai&#8217; of Papanasam Sivan), Deva Manohari (&#8216;Nee Kelana Edani&#8217; of Poochi Iyengar) and Kapi (&#8216;Bhaja Madhava Anisam&#8217;) were introduced for balancing the concert pace.Padma Shankar is one of the most favoured violinists of Gayathri Venkataraghavan because of the perfect rapport they share. Her share on the raga alapanas of Varali, Sri and Khambodi testified her ability to understand the vocalist&#8217;s priorities. The niraval part of Khambodi brought out the best of the relationship they share in performing.Kallidaikuruchi Sivakumar is a lively percussion artist. But for his brief energetic tani avaratanam, he played in the right decibels to suit the tone of the concert.
