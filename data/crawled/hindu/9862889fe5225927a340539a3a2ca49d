VMelodious StringsDr M. NarmadhaLive concert at Sri Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha, Mumbai.Four generations of violinists from the Parur School have successfully made a mark as soloists and accompanists.  Dr. M. Narmadha, a third generation violinist of the Parur School, is among the senior women violinists of the day. The emphasis which h\u000aer school lays on producing a strong and pleasing tonal quality is evident from Narmadha&#8217;s bowing and fingering techniques. This CD presents a live concert held under the auspices of Sri Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha in Mumbai.Narmadha&#8217;s selection of songs comprises ones which are frequently heard and familiar. A brisk opening is made with the Khanda ata tala Khambodi varnam &#8216;Sarasijanabha&#8217; rendered in two speeds. Obeisance to Lord Ganesha is paid with the Mysore Vasudevachar Gowla composition, &#8216;Pranamamyaham.&#8217; Following this are Tyagaraja&#8217;s Sriraga Pancharatna &#8216;Endaro Mahanubhavulu&#8217; and the Navarasa Kannada creation of Swati Tirunal &#8216;Vande Sada Padmanabham.&#8217; These pieces set the right tempo for the concert&#8217;s initial stages.A gamaka-rich vinyasa of Purvikalyani is a melodic essay with instrumentally suited prayogas and sancharas played with a high degree of confidence. Syama Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Ninnuvina&#8217; is an attractive version with bhava-rich niraval at the customary sahitya point &#8216;Parama Lobulanu.&#8217; The kalpanaswaras with tisra sequences are delightful to listen to.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Neevada Negana&#8217; (Saranga) has been a favourite with the Parur school. Narmadha presents a short sketch of Saranga with sancharas covering the entire tara sthayi.  The kriti is energetically rendered.Pasupathipriya is a raga created by Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar and could be termed as a janya of Harikhambodi.SRM PMDSandSDPMRMSconstitute the ascent (arohana) and descent (avarohana) of this raga. The composition &#8216;Saravanabhava&#8217; is catchy with a good grip over the tricky raga.Thodi and Kalyani are the two major ragas which feature for vinyasas. The Thodi alapana wins over the Kalyani essay due to the disciplined approach by the violinist, when compared with the free style adopted for the Kalyani alapana. The grandeur of Thodi is amply reflected in Narmadha&#8217;s playing and is a rewarding listening experience. &#8216;Kaddanuvariki&#8217; of Tyagaraja is the chosen kriti adorned with meaningful niraval at &#8216;Niddura Niragarinchi.&#8217; The solfa passages played after the niraval brim with the raga bhava.Three kritis of Tyagaraja are played in succession. &#8216;Nagumomu&#8217; (Abheri with Chatsruthi daivatham), &#8216;Nenendu Vedakudura&#8217; (Karnataka Behag) and &#8216;Ragasudharasa&#8217; (Andolika) are effectively rendered. Narmadha announces the raga for &#8216;Nenendu&#8217; as Hindustani Behag instead of Karnataka Behag. The inlay card, however, rightly reads as Karnataka Behag!The thanam following the Kalyani alapana is smooth. A pallavi in Khanda jathi triputa tala is gone through with ease and covers the trikalam and tisra sequences. Ragamalika swaras are offered in Kanada, Ranjani and Hindolam attractively. The tani avarthanam by the mridangam, ghatam and morsing artists is flawless with arresting rhythmic patterns. Their accompaniment for the songs is also of a high order. Only, the names of the accompanists do not feature in the inlay card!The other numbers Narmadha plays include &#8216;Thamarai Pootha&#8217; (Hindustan Gandhari), &#8216;Kaliyuga Varadan&#8217; (Brindavana Saranga), &#8216;Krishna Nee Begane&#8217; (Yamuna Kalyani) and the Dhanasree thillana of Swati Tirunal. A padam or a javali could have been chosen to provide a contrast in the played tukkadas. The versatility of Narmadha&#8217;s artistry is evident in this compact disc.(Incidentally, &#8216;Krishna Nee Begane&#8217; is a composition of Vyasaraya and not Purandaradasa as announced.)
