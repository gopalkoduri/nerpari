VGARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMThere were many interesting talking points in Dr. Ganesh's recital recently under the aegis of Mudra.Not in the least, the disputed authorship of his invocation kriti to Lord Ganapati. Also, his pitch, which must have been somewhere between 1.5 and 2 sruti, surely said much about Ganesh's implicit faith in the approach adopted by singers from the earlier generations.Diverse lineageAfter the opening Ata tala varnam in ragam Kanada, Ganesh's kalpanaswaram to `Abhishtavarada' in ragam Hamsadhvani was set to `Srimahaganapate' which begins on the fifth in the eight-beat cycle. Thereafter, Dr. Ganesh acknowledged his diverse lineage, which goes back to Kotesvara Iyer by bloodline and, in terms of his musical training, to the late Maharajapuram Santhanam. `Velayya dayavillaiya, ' was a composition of the former in Saveri and Ganesh took full advantage of the many rhyming phrases to convey the underlying emotion.Dikshitar's ``Santanagopalakrishnam" (Kamas) was the next piece to remember his guru on his birthday on May 20.His considerable scholarship  came to surface especially in the Mysore Vasudevachar kriti ``Ninne nammitinayya" in Simhendramadhyamam and Thyagaraja's ``Mitri bhagyame,"  in Kharaharapriya.`Chendoor Muruganin, ' a ragamalika kirtana in Navarasakannada, Revati and Sindubhairavi was a melodious rendition in praise of the sacred ash of the shrine at Tiruchendur.Madurai S.Balasubramanyan on the violin, K.R.Ganesh on the mridangam and Srirangam Kannan on the morsing gave able support to the vocalist.Bottom Template Starts
