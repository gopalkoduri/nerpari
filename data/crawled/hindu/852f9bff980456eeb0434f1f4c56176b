VVayalur Murugan Pamalai P. S. Krishnamurthy; Shanmukhasundaram Devotionals on Lord Muruga of Vayalur (three volumes) Price: Rs. 50 (Cassette)Rarely do you come across a devotional melody collection that has a significant personal slant to it. But K. D. Chandran's three volumes on Lord Muruga of Vayalur &#151;  Vayaluramritham, Vayalur Murugan Thunai and Vayalur Murugan Pamalai &#151;  are different.Father of the popular dancer and TV and film actor Sudha Chandran, whose debut film, `Mayuri' catapulted her to fame, Chandran who has penned the lyric for the songs along with his mother Sarada Doraiswamy, brings in many an autobiographical element in them.It is optimism you notice when he touches upon the odds he has scaled with the help and grace of the Lord of Vayalur.The Chandran presentations are available as cassettes and CDs, but K.D. Chandran (Ph: 022-26141250/ 26108760; 9233832362; email: chandrankd@yahoo.com) has not gone commercial with them.Interested folks approach him and pay what they wish for the products, and the amount in turn is diverted for social and religious projects in Vayalur.Honey-soaked pieces in the voice of P. S. Krishnamurthy adorn `Vayaluramritham.' PSK is also the composer of the album.His jathi for songs such as `Oru Piravi Nee Alithai' makes you visualise a classical dance sequence, vivid and enjoyable.   Again positive thoughts and melodic presentations mark Vayalur Murugan Thunai, composed and sung by P. S. Krishnamurthy.The latest in the collection is `Vayalur Murugan Pamalai,' tuned and sung by Shanmukasundaram.The lyrics (K. D. Chandran) possess a fervent religiosity but somehow they don't seem to jell very well with the tunes. Slow in pace, the songs convey frustration and distress more than anything else.The tunes on Side A are comparatively more cheerful. On the whole, the Pamalai is a much-watered down effort when compared with the exquisite `Vayaluramritham' and the enjoyable Vayalur Murugan Thunai.MALATHI RANGARAJANBottom Template Starts
