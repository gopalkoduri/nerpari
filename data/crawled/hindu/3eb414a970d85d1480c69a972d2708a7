VKoviladi Kala gave her vocal concert at Meenakshi, arranged in memory of Bharatharathna M.S. Subbulakshmi. True to the occasion, and in justification to the innate musical magnitude inherent in that luminary, Kala focused herself on presenting krithis, which were sung and popularised by M.S.Kala is endowed with an appeasing voice, which has an appreciable gamut and stability &#151;  be it the tarasthayi panchama or the mandra madhyama, her voice retained appreciable resilience and clarity.The graces were deep and distinct but not curt, and a smooth flow was always maintained between the relevant swara-s in all the alapana sections, so that the raga-s  bloomed into their full glory, both in form and essence.For the above reasons alapana in Hindola (and other ones) created an ambience of serenity and majesty, and this was further strengthened by the composition of Annamacharya, "Deva Devam Bhaje".At every stage she exhibited vision and imagination, taking care that her scholarship did not get itself into the clutches of what may be termed as indiscriminate ostentations.This quality made her concert pleasing and meditative.These features characterised presentations such as "Shambho Mahadheva" of Shri Thyagaraja composed in Kamavardhini and "Shri Kamakoti Pitasthithe" of Mysoru Sadhashivarayaru composed in Saveri.In the neraval, the general mood always conformed to that of the lyrics on hand and the kalpana swara-s were no exception to this general cast, and thus every presentation manifested itself in its entirety.Veena Suresh's fine-tuned support (violin) finely blending with the style and tone of the singer, H.L. Shivashankaraswamy's gentle and crisp rhythmic effects (mridanga) and Phaneendhra Bhaskar's reciprocating ghatam added lustre to the entire concert.V. NAGARAJBottom Template Starts
