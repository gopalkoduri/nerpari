VThis year, there  were a few organisations in New Delhi  that were geared up  to  arrange the  Tyagaraja Aradhana celebrations on the Pusya Bahula Panchami day itself.Vasundhara Enclave Sarveswara Samaj was one such organisation in  East Delhi. To start off,  the festival at Sri Sankatahara Ganapathy temple complex, local talents, both young and  old, participated in and rendered Tyagaraja  kritis .The festival culminated with a group singing of Tyagaraja&#8217;s Pancharatna  kritis&#8217; lead by  K. Vageesh. Some of  Delhi&#8217;s musicians including Vasantha Sundaram, Vasantha Krishnan, G. Elangovan, G. Raghuraman, Sudha Raghuraman, VSK Annadurai, Anirudh Bhardwaj and even the rasikas joined Vageesh in paying their homage to the great saint composer Tyagaraja.After a few invocation songs to  Lord Ganesha like &#8220;Sri Gananatha&#8221; (Malahari geetam) and &#8220;Sri Ganapatini&#8221;, a kriti of Tyagaraja in  raga Saurashtra,  Vageesh led the group in singing the Pancharatna kritis, namely &#8220;Jagadanandakaraka&#8221; (raga Nattai), &#8220;Dudukugala&#8221; (raga Gowla), &#8220;Sadinchene&#8221; (raga Arabhi), &#8220;Kanakanaruchira&#8221; (raga Varali) and &#8220;Endaro Mahanubhavulu&#8221; (raga Sri). It was heartening to see Vageesh leading a  group in the  Capital after quite a few  years.A somewhat disorderly percussion accompaniment was a  sore part of the event.  There were at least four mridangam and ghatam accompaniments (K. Sreeram, R. Srinivasan, P. Vetri Bhoopathy and N. Radhakrishnan).   The youngsters, in particular, should try to understand the intricacies of the Pancharatna kritis and accordingly provide  mridangam accompaniment so that the  pleasure of listening is  not  disturbed.The Noida Telugu Welfare Association and  Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam Charitable Trust, Noida, too organised Tyagaraja Aradhana  celebrations on  Pusya Bahula Panchami day at the newly constructed Sankara Hall in the Sri Adi Sankaracharya temple (Sankara Mutt), Noida. The  celebrations culminated with the rendering of the Pancharatna kritis of the saint composer by  Vasanthi Krishna Rao and her disciples. After presenting the traditional &#8220;Sri Ganapatini&#8221; in  raga Saurashtra, Vasanthi and her disciples presented the Pancharatna kritis in a synchronised manner to the delight of the listeners. After an emotive &#8220;Bagayanayya&#8221; in  raga Chandrajyoti, Vasanthi&#8217;s group  concluded with a melodious &#8220;Gitarthamu&#8221; in  raga Surati. While  Vageesh was on the violin, K. Sreeram provided support on the  mridangam.Earlier,  vocalist P.B. Kannakumar presented  kritis of the saint composer. The scheduled  concert of Kannakumar was  reduced to less than an hour-and-a-half, partly, because of the delayed start  and partly because of the unscheduled inclusion of recitals by Kannakumar&#8217;s students. Nevertheless, Kannakumar gave a spirited performance in the reduced time slot. However, he could have  avoided his lectures before  each song and  utilised this time for singing. But then, teaching being his profession, lectures  seem unavoidable. Kannakumar was ably assisted by VSK Annadurai on the violin and Ramamurthi on the mridangam.It is also heartening to note that the celebrations in memory of this great saint composer are  set to continue  in the  Capital this month and the following month.Managing Director of The Hindu and president of the Music Academy, Chennai, N. Murali will inaugurate the festival at AP Bhawan, Ashoka Road, this Saturday. He will present various awards to the artistes in the presence of the Chief Election Commissioner, N. Gopalaswami. A portrait of saint Tyagaraja will also be unveiled on the occasion.The awardees of this year include Nada Kalanidhi Vedavalli, Natya Ratna, Kalanidhi Narayanan, Nada Bhushanam Malladi Brothers and Radha Venkatachalam, Natya Ilavarasi Meenakshi Chittaranjan and Rajeswari Sainath, Delhi Yuva Kalakar P.B. Kannakumar (vocal), V.S.K. Annadorai (violin), Chandrasekharan (mridangam) and Janhavi Rajaraman (dance).On the opening day, the Malladi Brothers will give a vocal recital.On the forenoon of Sunday, there will be a panel discussion on traditions in music and dance in which R. Vedavalli, Kalanidhi Narayanan, Leela Venkataraman, Radha Venkatachalam, Bombay Jayshree, Meenakshi Chittaranjan, Rajeswari Sainath, Subha Ganesan and others are expected to participate.In the evening, Subha Ganesan will sing, followed by Bombay Jayshree Ramnath. On Monday, P.B. Kannakumar will present a vocal recital , followed by the Bombay Sisters, C. Saroja and C. Lalitha. The concluding day will feature C. Mahalakshmi, Lakshmi Rangarajan and Subhiksha Rangarajan&#8217;s vocal recitals.His death anniversary, observed as the day he was united with the Supreme being, is marked by singing his kritis. It is celebrated as Tyagaraja Aradhana, not only in Tiruvaiyaru, where he spent his life, but the world over.
