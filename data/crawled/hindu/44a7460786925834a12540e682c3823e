VBhagavath Gita as perceived by TyagarajaJayanthi Sridharan &#8211; CDCarnatic Classical - Price not mentionedJayanthi Sridharan is a vocalist of commendable order who has had the benefit of training under several reputed gurus such as Maharajapuram Santhanam, R.Vedavalli, M.L.Vasantha Kumari and currently violin vidwan M. Chandrasekharan.She has released a CD of her live thematic concert titled, &#8216;Bhagavad Gita as perceived by Tyagaraja&#8217;.She has been accompanied by violinist Kandadevi Vijayaraghavan, R. Ramakrishnan on the mridangam and Venkat on the flute.A few slokas from the Bhagavad Gita followed by select kritis of Tyagaraja comprise the programme.The Dhyana slokam in Nattai precedes the vivadi mela kriti in Ganamurthi, &#8216;Ganamurthe&#8217;.The song interpretation, while passable, has a few errors in diction. It should be &#8216;Tribhuvana Pala&#8217; meaning one who protects the three worlds. And not &#8216;Tribhuvana Bala,&#8217; which has a different connotation. The Hamsadhwani sloka and &#8216;Raghunayaka&#8217; in Adi tala pass muster.The lyrics in Malayamarutham are a precursor to &#8216;Sasivadana&#8217; in Chandrajyoti.An exuberant rendition by the singer is satisfactory, except for the occasional hints of the Suddha Madhyamam, &#8216;Dinajanavana&#8217; in Bowli, a Divyanama kirtana of Tyagaraja is sung with gusto. The Behag raga sketch of the violinist and the vocalists sloka in the same melody, have quality to engage rasika interest. &#8216;Koluvamaregada&#8217; in Thodi is embellished with creditable laya accompaniment on the mridangam.A brief essay of Panthuvarali by Jayanthi is quite pleasing, while Vijayaraghavan&#8217;s depiction showcases his leanings towards the Parur tradition.The Taraka Nama, meticulously chanted by Siva, who is a master in Sama Veda chants, is the quintessence of divinity.&#8216;Sarame Gani,&#8217; that portrays the greatness of &#8216;Taraka Nama&#8217; is a melodious rendering despite occupying the extra speed track.&#8216;Thavadasoham&#8217; in Punnagavarali and &#8216;Ramakatha Sudha&#8217; that says, the story of Rama will serve as a beacon and as a boat for being bestowed with the four blessings, Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha, conclude an album imaginatively and interestingly conceived.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
