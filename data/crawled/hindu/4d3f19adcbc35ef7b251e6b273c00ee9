VH.S. Gururajachar, the 85-year-old vocalist, has the strength and vigour of a young man and rarely  falters in tonal quality. Clarity in expression and grammar in his music and sahitya import were intact. He mastered almost all the compositions of the great saint composers and also of Puranadaradasa, forerunner of Thyagaraja whose method of teaching music is still in vogue.Perhaps Gururajachar is the lone veteran who can sing almost all the compositions of Purandaradasa, many of which went into his album, produced by the music sabha Sangeetha Ksheerasagaram. The album was released on this occasion.There are more than 40 compositions, with a good share for Purandaradasa&#8217;s works. The sabha organised this function last week at the Thyagaraya Ganasabha. The CD was released by Dr. C.
