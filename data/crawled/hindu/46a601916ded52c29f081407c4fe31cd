VMasters of music like Tyagaraja understood the need to give a physical form to cardinal elements of music. They conceived the idea of tonal forms, the various aspects of music as human forms, in flesh and blood. Invisible ragas and sangatis turned tangible. This is what Tygaraja developed in his famous kriti &#8216;Naada sudharasambilanu&#8230;'Bombay Jayashri Ramnath had more than one reason to open her concert, &#8216;Kadambari,' with this composition. With this, and another one from Tyagaraja later, she delved into the musicology of the saint-musician.Elements of musicThe ambrosia of &#8216;nada' in human form, which Tyagaraja sings in this kriti, was Jayashri. And she proceeded to fit in the elements of music to this composition and into a few more kritis in the course of her two-hour concert, &#8216;Kadambari,' at the plush J.T. Performing Arts Centre, Thripunithura.Arabhi creates a sort of fresh, free-flowing, happy mood &#8211; a perfect raga for an opening. And Jayashri, who is known for her lucid enunciation of the lyrics, went about delineating the raga and the kriti without any sort of unnecessary flamboyance.From the start, right through her concert, Jayashri seemed to be propagating Tyagaraja's views on music. The beautiful &#8216;sangatis' were etched in emotional propriety and contextual relevance. There was a precision in her singing, with every note in place and with relevant emotion in the right context. And when Jayashri rendered &#8216;Sogasuga mridanga talamu&#8230;,' in Sriranjini, she completed the musical statement. If it was &#8216;nada,' &#8216;ragas' and &#8216;sangatis' in the opening number, it was &#8216;kriti,' its definition, meaning and function in her second kriti for the evening. More than anything else, a kriti had to be marked by correct placement of swaras, rhythmic turns and pauses, in order to reflect the true meaning of a composition.Melodic simplicityJayashri has essentially offered to look at Carnatic music from a refreshingly new perspective. It is beauty in simplicity. There is no ostentatious raga alapana or complex swara patterns complicating the presentation. In her exposition of Sriranjini, there were unmistakable flashes of the Hindustani style, which left the listener pondering for a while about the raga.However, one felt an apparent strain in Jayashri's voice. The richness of texture and touch of tenderness were evident but the easiness with which she is known to transcend the higher octaves was missing.And she got no real assistance from Mysore Srikanth (violin) who was on his own trip. He struggled while trying to keep pace with Jayashri but looked on firm ground on his own.Jayashri chose Mohanam as the main raga of the evening. Once again it was a Tyagaraja kriti &#8211; &#8216;Mati matiki&#8230;' All the details of the raga was touched upon in spells of crisp sancharas. The raga and kriti was presented with every delicate nuance sounding beautiful while niraval and kalpanaswaras were balanced exercises in melody.In between the Tyagaraja kritis, Jayashri strung together a bouquet of compositions by Muthuswami Dikshitar, (&#8216;Sri Venkatagirisa&#8230;' in Surutti) Narayanathirtha (&#8216;Mrigayada Radhamadhavam'&#8230;' in Behag) and Jayadeva (&#8216;Rase Hari&#8230;' in Karnaranjini). Jayashri rounded off her concert with a thillana by her guru Lalgudi Jayaraman in Vasanthi raga.Poongulam Subramaniam on the mridangam and Udupi Sreedhar on the ghatam offered refined support. The taniavarthanam was brisk, and very professional.At the end of the concert one wondered why the concert was named &#8216;Kadambari.' In fact, there were at least a few rasikas who must have thought Jayashri would sing Dikshitar's &#8216;Kadambari priyayai&#8230;' in Mohanam, the main raga, to justify this title. Again, Jayashri's trademark meditative ambience was felt only in flashes. Perhaps this largely had to do with the choice of kritis. But overall, Jayashri's soulful rendering held sway.
