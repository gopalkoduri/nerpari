VR.Suryaprakash has sung 10 compositions of Muthuswamy Dikshitar which he has classified to fall within the six facets of the Shanmatha concept, established by Adi Sankara. The compact disc has been released by Purnima records.Obeisance to Ganesha is paid through the Ardradesi kriti &#8216;Sri Ganeshapatram.&#8217; This is a rare kriti  on Ganesha by Muthuswami Dikshitar. Suryaprakash&#8217;s rendering is good though an eerie feeling is experienced in parts during this song rendition. The kaisiki nishada, which is an alien swara to raga Ardradesi makes an appearance on two occasions. The first is while singing the lyric &#8216;Vagadi Panchaka&#8217; in the anupallavi and the second  is during the singing of &#8216;Shwetarka Sumadhara&#8217; in the charanam. This should have been eschewed.The kriti which follows represents &#8216;Kaumaram&#8217; and is &#8216;Subrahmanyena &#8217; in Suddha Dhanyasi. Suryaprakash&#8217;s vocalisation of this popular song is bright and the solfa passages sung for the pallavi, with alternate endings on the Gandhara and Panchama notes, are engaging. Violinist Vittal Ramamurthy&#8217;s replies  are equally interesting.  In the charanam &#8216;Kankasaila&#8217; is pronounced as &#8216;Gangasaila&#8217; which needs to be corrected.  &#8216;Kankasaila&#8217; is the Sanskrit name for &#8216;Kazhugumalai.&#8217;&#8216;Visalakshim&#8217; (Kasiramakriya ) in misra chapu is the kriti chosen by the vocalist to represent &#8216;Shaktham.&#8217; The patanthara of the song is good. The niraval at &#8216;Kashiragnim Kapalinim&#8217; is slightly overdone in the upper octave which could have been more refined. The niraval is however brisk. Kalpanaswaras are not sung after the niraval.Suryaprakash has done a good service by opting to present less familiar kritis such as  &#8216;Kayarohanesham&#8217; (Devagandharam) on Lord Siva at the Nagapattinam temple, &#8216;Guruguhadhanyam&#8217; (Balahamsa) and &#8216;Maruvakadi malini&#8217; (Marwa) on Devi. These three krithis are his chosen representatives of Saivam, Kaumaram and Shaktham concepts. The songs are sung with a lot of feeling and are creditable renditions.&#8216;Vaishnavism&#8217; is represented by an excellent singing of the delicate composition &#8216;Balakrishnam&#8217; in Gopikavasantham. The lyrics of the song are very effectively sung.Khambhodi is the only raga which features for a vinyasa in this album. Both the vocalist and the violinist offer pleasant essays. &#8216;Maragathavallim&#8217; is the kriti following the alapana. Srimushnam Raja Rao (mridangam) and Vaikom Gopalakrishnan (Ghatam) offer enthusiastic percussion support from the start to finish of this disc.Suryaprakash winds up with &#8216;Suryamurthe&#8217; (Saurashtram) in a slightly accelerated tempo followed by a soothing rendition of a Yamunakalyani kriti &#8216;Paramasivathmajam.&#8217; This rarely heard composition is the highlight of this disc.Suryaprakash has been a consistent performer in the concert circle over the past decade. He possesses a pliable voice which is sruti-aligned. It has almost become customary for Suryaprakash to resort to the phrase &#8216;Ga Ma Pa Ma Ga Ri Ga Sa Ri Ga,&#8217; while singing kalpanaswaras for kritis in Khambodi and Sankarabharanam. This  finds a place in this disc as well.  Suryaprakash is a capable artist and would do well to seek fresh possibilities.R. SuryaprakashPurnima RecordsMRP Rs 125.
