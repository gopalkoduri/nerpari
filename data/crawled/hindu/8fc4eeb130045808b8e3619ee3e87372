VGAUTAM CHATTERJEEThe 75th birthday of veteran vocalist Prabha Attre is being celebrated nationwide by her countless fans and admirers. Programmes  were organised recently in Pune and Kolkata to commemorate six decades of a marvellous career in which this artiste has \u000abecome synonymous with the raga Maru Bihag. Two voluminous books of her own bandishes, &#8220;Swarangini&#8221; and &#8220;Swaranjini&#8221;, were released along with CDs in which Chetana Banawat, her disciple, has sung the  bandishes and a set of two cassettes Amrit Prabha, rendered in her own voice, was also released to mark the occasion. In the early &#8217;60s, she became famous for rendering raga Maru Bihag. She presented raga Bihag in Kolkata this past month at a programme organised by sarod maestro Buddhadev Dasgupta. &#8220;I am overwhelmed by the fact that people are still appreciating me, saying that age has not yet encroached on my voice,&#8221; said Prabha, who  is currently busy tutoring her disciples, writing books, bandishes and of course, carrying on singing. She remains very devoted to her school of music established in Pune. &#8220;In the ocean of sound, I am searching for the pearls of divine notes. At this stage when I look back, I realise that all my thinking, experiences, actions, reactions are associated with music, directly or indirectly, especially when music has become my life&#8217;s goal and also a full time profession. I was in the pre-matriculation year &#8211; in the 9th class &#8211; when I started my lessons with Sureshbabu (Mane). At 75, I feel I still take lessons from him. Emotionally, my gurus are always with me,&#8221; Prabha added.Decorated with the Padma Bhushan, Prabha Attre belongs to the Kirana gharana of Ustad Abdul Karim Khan, trained first by Sureshbabu Mane and then by Hirabai Barodekar. She drew inspiration from the styles of Amir Khan and Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. &#8220;Music entered my life accidentally,&#8221; said she calmly. &#8220;Once, just as accidentally I lost my voice. I was invited to sing at Savada in Khandesh. As usual, I had my meal after the concert. When I woke up, next morning I found my voice queer. I could not utter a syllable. It was my guru who helped me find my voice again. Baburao (Sureshbabu) also made me sing film songs of actress-singer Noorjahan whom I liked very much. In those days, students were forbidden even to listen to music other than that of their own gharanas. I learned the famous thumri &#8216;Akeli Mat Jaiyyo Radhe Jamuna Ke Teer&#8230;&#8217; from Champu Tai (Hirabai&#8217;s family name)&#8221;.Prabha, who lives a life of simplicity and searches for beauty through art, sums up her life thus: &#8220;Art  is a continuous search for beauty. It is a way of sharpening one&#8217;s sensitivity and one&#8217;s awareness. It is a great power that can give an experience of ecstasy. I sing only for this ecstasy.&#8221;Bottom Template Starts
