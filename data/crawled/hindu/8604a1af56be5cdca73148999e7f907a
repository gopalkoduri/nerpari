VA. RAMALINGA SASTRYThe Visakhapatnam branch of Kalyani Music Group (Hyderabad) organised an evening of jugalbandi on veena by Salil V. Bhatt and sitar by Chandramohan Bhatt last Wednesday. While Salil learnt the art from his father, the noted Grammy Award winner Pt. Viswamohan Bhatt, Chandramohan mastered the art of playing sitar under the expert tutelage of Pt. Sasimohan Bhatt.On the evening, they were expertly accompanied on tabla by Prithviraj Mishra, a prime disciple of renowned Kishan Maharaj. The veena on which Salil played was actually a modified version of Hawaian guitar and had features of the traditional and \u000avichitra veenascombined with that of electronic guitar with 19 strings. The music that emerged from it had all attributes of tranquilising melody and perhaps that is the reason why Salil prefers to call itSatwik veena. <\u000a/p>Salil and Chandramohan played a composition in the medium, medium fast and super fast tempos inraag Marubahar, a modified version ofBaharwhich in turn has its origin in theKapi That(thought\u000a) of the raga classification system of the north Indian tradition of classical music.The prelude ofaalap, jhoreandjhalalternately on the veena and sitar turned out to be a scholarly exercise by Salil and Chandramohan. They concluded the recital with aDhun(Rajasthani folk).\u000a Prithviraj on tabla was excellent. Later, the audience also had the pleasure of watching a Kathak performance by Vidyahari Deshpandey and her disciples to pre-recorded music.Bottom Template Starts
