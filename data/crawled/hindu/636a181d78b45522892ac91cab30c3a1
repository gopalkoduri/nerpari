VAnish King, the young violinist from America, is not new to Hamsadhwani's annual NRI festival. He has appeared with his brother Sean in violin duets earlier.A student of T.N. Krishnan and later Balakrishnan, Anish was perfectly comfortable in his fine performance.Starting with &#8216;Gurulekha' in Gaurimanohari, Khandachapu, he sailed through his short alapana in Purvikalyani, and presented Tyagaraja's &#8216;Gnaanamu Sagarada' in rupakam, embellishing it with tidy niraval and kalpanaswaras. Swati Tirunal's &#8216;Kripayaa Paalaya' in Charukesi followed a brief sketch of the raga.Graceful playingAnish's smiling, otherwise impassive, mien only evinced quiet confidence as he went about his improvisations in swaras at &#8216;Kripayaa&#8230;' on half-beat with grace.&#8216;Sarasa Saama' of Tyagaraja in Kapinarayani was rendered elegantly. The style of his master stood out in Anish's fairly detailed rendition of Thodi, with appropriate emphasis of the morchanas, its shortness notwithstanding.With a variety of pleasing korvais, Anish brought out a detailed presentation of Tyagaraja's &#8216;Enduku Dayaraadura' in Misrachapu, to a neat conclusion.The 10-minute thani between B. Sivaraman (mridangam) and Subba Rao (ghatam) was crisp and apt for the concert. The percussionists contributed effectively to a wholesome concert.Anish continued with the bars of Western music popularised by the late Madurai Mani Iyer (known as &#8216;The English Note').He brought in special touches (original version?) not heard before. The thillana in Paras and Tiruppugazh in Hamsanandi brought the concert to a close.Much needs to be said for the sustained dedication of the artist to this form of musical art, to which his guides can also lay claim.
