VReminiscencesPadmavathiAnanthagopalanCarnatic classical instrument veenaPrice Rs. 250/- (CD)Padmavathi Ananthagopalan, a senior veena vidushi, had chosen the veena for her musical expression, despite belonging to the illustrious Lalgudi tradition of violin. Her CD titled "Reminiscences" with H.S. Sudhindra on the mridangam and Sukanya Ramgopal on the ghatam, begins auspiciously with Koteeswara Iyer's "Varanamukhava" in Hamsadhwani.The neat rendering of the kriti with its lively Chittaswaram and kalpanaswara sequences, meticulous in laya and melodically pleasing, speaks of quality of a high order. The few raga phrases of Sahana and "Eevasudha" of Tyagaraja played with extreme composure make a bee-line to the rasika's mind and heart. Dharmavati is unfolded with a concentrated, melodic structure highlighting the essential swaroopa of the raga. Dikshitar's Samashti charanam composition "Parandamavathi" in Roopaka Tala has imaginative swara prastharas in the Pallavi. The artiste's exposition of Sankarabharanam with all its majestic grace and singular gamaka nuances, stood out for its vital classical thrust. The tanam, entertaining and enlivening, is a prelude to Tyagaraja's "Enduku Peddala" that is adorned with swara festoons that eschew superfluity and retain the relevant. The percussion interlude rises to rasika expectations with Sukanya Ramagopal, perhaps a loner for years  -   in the art of ghatam playing, meeting the challenge with zeal and confidence. Dharmapuri Subbarayar's Javali in Kanada "Vani Pondu" closes the album in style.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
