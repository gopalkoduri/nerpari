VG. JAYAKUMARWith matching responses, it looked as if the sitar and the tabla were making animated conversation to each other. The language  -   the raag Kirvani in teen tal. This dual performance was one of the enjoyable highs of Sunday's sitar recital by Gaurav Mazumdar at Vyllopilly Sanskriti Bhavan, Thiruvananthapuram. Gaurav Mazumdar, disciple of Pandit Ravi Shankar, has played alongside maestros like Yehudi Menuhin. Accompanying him on the tabla was Debashish Mukherjee.Earlier, Gaurav Mazumdar began his sitar recital with the South Indian raga Hemavathi. He made a brief introduction of the raga by playing its notes, then continued in the company of a gath  -   16 beats on the tabla by Debashish Mukherjee.Next Gaurav chose raag Yaman, akin to Kalyani in Carnatic music. In North India, the raga is played mostly to create a devotional mood and a sense of well-being. Gaurav elaborated on the raag, playing jod and jaala, that is note by note without the rhythm. This was followed by a jhaptal composition with 10 beats on the tabla.The third piece of the evening was the romantic Kirvani, one of Gaurav's favourite ragas. The sitar brought forth the similarity in Kirvani's notes with the harmonic minor scale of Western music, much to the delight of the foreigners in the audience.The recital concluded with the famous bhajan `Vaishnava janato.'The programme was organised by Tapovan Heritage Home, run by a German national, Andreas Heitmann.Bottom Template Starts
