VIf teenage tabla player Rimpa Shiva electrified the crowd, meditative Manjari Asanare-Kelkar introduced a peaceful celebration of music.Venkatesh Kumar and Samaresh Chawdhury took Hindustani music lovers to new heights.The all-night music concert organised by the Gururao Deshpande Sangeet Sabha at Indian Institute of Science on Saturday was a true treat.Manjari began her concert with the soothing raga Nand. She opened the concert with a vilambit khyal "Saiyyan Tore Sakala Bana" and followed it with "Ajahoona Aayo Sham".The audience loved every bit of the concert, which saw Manjari not only soar the octaves, but also gave it depth by her improvisations. Manjari went on to render an impressive Mudriki Kanada with a lovely bandish "Gaavo Mangala Chaar". Her bhajan "Hirana" was soulful.The audience wished that their hands were far stronger to applaud louder for Rimpa. Each time she improvised the crowd was ecstatic.Her long strokes, the glides and her dexterity  astonished the audience. The hitherto unheard sounds she produced took the audience to a whole new world. The overjoyed audience gave her a standing ovation. Pt. Venkatesh Kumar sang Raga Lalith with "Aye Mora Ghara Aa" in vilambit and "Baalam Aaya... " in dhrut. The vachana "Pranati Ide" soaked in devotion. As he ended the concert with his famous dasara pada "Ondu Baari Smarane Saalade" he too won a standing ovation from the audience.Pt. Choudhury presented raga Charukeshi . He concluded his recital with thumri in Raga Mishra Pahadi with bandish "Na Javo Balamva Parades".Pandit Vinayak Torvi and Suma Sudhindra enthralled the audience.They even launched the website of the Sabha on the occasion.M.
