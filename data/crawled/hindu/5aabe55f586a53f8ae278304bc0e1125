VHis voice, as it gets to the upper octaves has a pleasing mellowness.The alapanas had   phrases perfected by honing and the kriti rendition was marked  by  a keen sahithya-sense.Raghava began with &#8216;Sri Ganapathini&#8217; (Sourashtram) and followed it up with the expected &#8216;Guruleka Etuvanti&#8217; (Gouri Manohari).Purvikalyani raga vistharam (Gnanamosagaradha), had a slightly ambiguous beginning but attained clarity as it progressed.&#8216;Bale Balendhu&#8217; (Rithigowlai) warranted a more stretched kalapramanam for the kriti to unfold in all its majesty.&#8216;Nannu Kannathalli&#8217; (Sindhu Kannada) and &#8216;Haridasulu Vedale&#8217; (Yamuna Kalyani) were his other inclusions.VVS Murari (violin) and Ganapathy Raman (mridangam) accompanied in a manner that would have ideally suited the youngster&#8217;s manodharma.N. Murali, Managing Director ofThe Hindu, released a CD containing kritis and slokas rendered by Raghava Krishna. P.S.Narayanaswami received the first copy.
