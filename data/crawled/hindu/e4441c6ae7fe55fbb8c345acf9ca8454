VThis young singer,  who hails from Kunnamkulam, is a disciple of Mangad Nateshan. Beginning with &#8216;Sarsudaa,&#8217; a varnam in Saveri, composed by Kothavaasal Venkata Rama Iyer, the vocalist then presented the Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Teliya leru&#8217;  in Dhenuka. &#8216;Ardhanareeswaram,&#8217; a composition by Dikshitar in Kumudakriya, was followed by a gripping depiction of Kambhoji.  After thaanam, he rendered &#8216;Kailasa Nathena&#8217; by the same poet-composer.Edappally Ajithkumar on the violin, Cherthala Dinesh on the mridanagam, and Elenjimel Sushilkumar on the ghatam, provided accompaniment.A violin duet by Lalgudi G.J.R. Krishnan and Lalgudi Vijaya Lakshmi is always  refreshing, as the elder brother become a  good foil to the younger sister in terms of technique. The duo set off with the Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Pancha Maathanga&#8217;  in Malahari, which was decked with  swara playing.After Swati Titunal&#8217;s &#8216;Jaya jaya Padmananabhaanu Jesha&#8217;  in Manirangu, Krishnan came up with a fluent Sahana and the krithi &#8216;E Vasudhaa&#8217; by Tyagaraja.Vijaya Lakshmi played a Bhairavi and &#8216;Lalithe Sree,&#8217; one of the Lalgudi Pancharathnams, was gracefully aligned to it. Krishnan came on with Sanakarabharanam and &#8216;Dakshinamoorthe,&#8217; a Dikshithar piece, set to misra Jhampa, became  the nucleus of the concert. Padri Satishkumar on the  on the mridangam, Kangazha Vasudevan Namboothri on the ghanjira and Thripunithura Radhakrishnan on the ghatam ably supported the siblings.An interesting feature about P. Unnikrishnan&#8217;s concerts is his decision to borrow a feature  from the Ariyakudi school of music in not wasting  time when on  stage.His Lathnagi was excellent with &#8216;Pirava&#8217; by Papanasam Sivan, Saveri (&#8216;Sabheshan&#8217; by Dr. S. Ramanathan) and a detailed version of Kambhoji merging with &#8216;Thiruvadi saranam&#8217; (GopalaKrishna Bharathi).  T.H. Subrahmaniam and Thrissur Narendran bewitched the listeners. Radhakrishnan matched them on the ghatam.Trichi V. Pradip Kumar proved his mettle in the varnam in Mohanam, &#8216;Ninnu Kori&#8217; by Ramanathapuram Srinivasa Iyengar, which was sung effortlessly, in varying tempos.This effortless style of singing was proved yet again  when he rendered &#8216;Dudugu&#8217; in Gowla Pancharathnam, &#8216;Ananda Natana&#8217; in Kedaram and &#8216;Brihaspathe&#8217; in Atana, both by Dikshitar, and Swati Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Paalayamam&#8217; in Khamas.T.H. Subrahmaniam  played the violin. V.V. Ramana Moorthy and  and Adichanallur Anil Kumar handled the mridangam and the ghatom with efficacy.
