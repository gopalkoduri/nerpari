VG.SWAMINATHANIntensive training and a positive attitude were evident in the concert of Ashok Ramani performing at the Music Academy for Papanasam Sivan Day on November 11. He met the challenge posed by a recalcitrant voice employing all his skills.Ramani had judiciously avoided popular kritis. He rendered `Dasaratatmajam' in Poorvikalyani and `Devi un patham paninden' in Todi. The latter is indeed a very fine and emotionally mounted aesthetic composition with an add-on swara-sahitya chittaswaram. `Karunai seivai' in Hamsadhwani, `Gowri manohara' in Gowrimanohari and `Kalpakambigai' in Behag also found place in this programme.Ramani could not reach the upper registers but made amends with  a rapid-fire swaraprasthara. Ashok had the support of veteran accompanists who showed perfect understanding.  V.V.Ravi on the violin, for instance, added the niceties in raga essays and spirit to the swaras. The neraval at `Paada malarai oru podumidayam maravaa varam arul' (Todi) reflected piety. The kuraippu swaras centred on shadjam were well linked.  J. Vaidyanathan and Karthick on the mridangam and the ghatam respectively lent superb percussion support never being boisterous. Their well-knit `thani' that followed was something special with carefully chosen patterns.Bottom Template Starts
