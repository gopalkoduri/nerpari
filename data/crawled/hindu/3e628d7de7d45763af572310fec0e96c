VPallavi Prasanna Madyastha's concert at Thripunithura revealed a bani that had traces of her guru Lalitha Sivakumar's style and the Karnataka bani. The strong influence of D.K. Pattammal's approach was also evident in her music.Mellow RevagupthiPallavi began the concert with an impressive alapana of the melodious and mellow raga Revagupthi, followed by Swati Tirunal's &#8216;Gopalaka Pahimam Anisam' in the same raga.&#8216;Ennai Nee Marivade,' a rare composition by M.M. Dandapani Desikar in Amrithavarshini, came next.Her rendering of &#8216;Ragasudharasa Paanamu jesi' in Andolika, janya of the 28th Melakartha raga Harikamboji, composed by Tyagaraja, impressed the audience. It was ornamented with manodharma swaras.Pallavi's rich alaap of Thodi was proof of her skill. This was followed by a vivacious and sublime rendering of Swati's &#8216;Mandaradhara.' Next was a ragamalika &#8216;Narayana Hari Mangalam Ganapathi,' composed by Mangalam Ganapathi.Distinctive stylePallavi's alaap of Nalinakanthi struck a chord with the rasikas. Although, the influence of the D.K. Pattammal school was clear, the singer imbued it with her own style. The tanam for this piece was in four speed. She was well accompanied by Parvathi Venkitachalam on the violin.&#8216;Gopalam Kuvalaya Paripaalam' was the pallavi, composed by Lalitha Sivakumar. Swaraprasthara and niraval were apt. Rajnarayanan (mridangam) and Dipu Elamkulam (ghatam) delivered a good tani.A mellifluous rendering of M.D. Ramanathan's &#8216;Sagarasayana Vibho Prabho' in Bagesri preceded the thillana, Swati's &#8216;Dheem Thakumiku Thakadheem' in Dhanasree, with which she concluded the concert. The concert was organised by Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha, Thripunithura in memory of Vaikam Vasudevan Nair and Thankam Vasudevan Nair.
