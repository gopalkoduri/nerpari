VPercussion lovers of Irinjalakuda were treated to an edakka concert by Tomoe Tara Irino at the mini Koothambalam of Ammannur Gurukulam recently.A regular visitor of the Gurukulam and Natanakairali for the last 12 years, Tomoe has established herself as a Koodiyattam performer by donning varied roles in the annual festivals here and also by staging Nangiarkoothu shows both in Kerala and Japan.A disciple of the late Guru Ammannur Madhava Chakyar, G. Venu and Nirmala Panicker, Tomoe has proven her artistry in Mohiniyattam as well. She is equally comfortable in Malayalam and Sanskrit. However, few knew she was undergoing rigorous training for the past six years on the edakka, a percussion instrument peculiar to Kerala. Therefore the performance came as a surprise to all.&#8220;Rhythm is a passion to Tomoe,&#8221; said P. Nandakumar, who taught her to play the edakka. A member of Bamboo Orchestra, Tokyo, that had visited Kerala a few years ago, Tomeo, a graduate in electrical engineering, has her own unit for the manufacture of eco-friendly bamboo instruments in Tokyo. She is also an exponent of Marimba, a traditional Japanese drum.Traditional patternThe performance directed by Nandakumar owed much to the pattern followed by the edakka artistes at the sopanam. Tomoe began the concert with the customary &#8216;tristhanam pidikkal,' the beating of sa, pa, sa on the instrument. Thereafter came the &#8216;Ganapathikkai.' Combinations of &#8216;thakkitta, tharikita' followed in the &#8216;paadha kkai.'Tomeo accompanied Nelluvai Krishnankutty Marar on the edakka with crisp rhythmic beats.She exuded amazing confidence while beating out the tirmanams typical of the percussion instrument. The first number was a &#8216;thyaani' in Sourshtram praising Lord Vishnu. Then followed an Edakka kooru in Chembada which she played with abandon.Tomoe's edakka accompaniment to the 14th Ashtapathy, &#8216;Smarasamarojitha virajithavesha' in Neelambari and Saranga in Adi tala was typical of the conventional style by any seasoned artiste.She wound up the solo recital in which varied &#8216;nadais' including &#8216;chaturasra' (four), &#8216;khanta' (five) et al were presented. The change from one to the other was quintessential of her acute sense of rhythm.Tudi, an organisation for the popularisation of traditional vadyas of Kerala, organised Tomoe's performance.
