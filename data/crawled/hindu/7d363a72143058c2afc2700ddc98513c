VThe vocal concert of Krishnamurthy sponsored by Kalasagaram was a unique example of what a seriously physically handicapped artiste could achieve. He has found smiles and success by the dint of his interest and involvement and could present a reasonably good concert lasting 180 minutes. The movement of hands and manipulation of fingers is mandatory in a Carnatic music concert, the deprivation of which is a serious hindrance. Krishnsmurthy&#8217;s application was exemplary and his achievement astonishing in a situation of such serious handicap. To comment that the concert holistically was outstanding is certainly a fallacy, but what has been achieved under the circumstances is unquestionably exceptional. Krishnamurthy is gifted with good voice and he uses it to the hilt; his skill of aligning with thesrutiis equally productive and the basics are this achieved. However, hismanodharma sangithain terms ofalapana, neravalandswarakalpanahowever inadequate, is yet praiseworthy.The concert commenced with thevarnamin Saveri and moved on to akrithiin Abhogi. The choice of theswarjithaiof Shyamasastry in Bhairavi and set tomisra chapuwas very judicious. Thekrithiwent on at the established time measure and made a powerful impact; the mastery oflayaby the artiste was candid.Brovabharamain Bahudari andSunbrmanyuenain Sudha Dhanyasi were the items which added required thrill to the structure of the concert. Thodi was chosen for elaborate treatment and was portrayed reasonably well. The uncommonkrithiof Thyagaraja,Aaragimpavewas well received. Kishnamurthy has to plan a design inmanodharma sangathis; it has the usual and common approach, which does not add to creativity. The highlight of the concert was the excellent violin by B.S Narayanan. His contribution to Thodi was unique. Jaya Bhaskar is a good percussion player but he has a tendency to overplay on the mridangam
