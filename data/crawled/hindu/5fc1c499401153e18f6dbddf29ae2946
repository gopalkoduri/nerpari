VAnupama Shrimali (Ganabharathi\u000aat Veene Sheshanna\u000aBhavana) gave her vocal recital,\u000aaccompanied by H.S.\u000aThandavamurthi (violin) and\u000aM.R. Manjunath (mridanga).\u000aMelodious voice made for expressions\u000awas congenial for depicting\u000athe deeper aspects of\u000aclassical music. Deep graces set to\u000atwo speeds, clear accents and a\u000afine sense of shruthi in Thiruvottiyur\u000aThyagayya's varna, "Karunimpa"\u000a(Shahana), amply\u000adenoted her sadhana and commitment.Had she maintained the above\u000afervour with an added flavour of\u000aversatility in the rest of the presentations,\u000athe entire picture\u000awould have definitely gone in her\u000afavour. The overall planning and\u000aapproach seemed to have drifted\u000amore towards the lighter aspects.\u000aThis attenuated impact could not\u000acommand unreserved\u000aappreciations.In the absence of significant\u000aspontaneity, the renderings\u000amainly appealed by virtue of gentle\u000avocal inflections, clarity in accents\u000aand a moderately slow pace\u000athat favoured easy comprehension\u000aof the body of the texts. Jayachamaraja\u000aWadiyar's "Shri\u000aMahaganapathim" (Atana),\u000aMuthayya Bhagavathar's two\u000acompositions "Saarasamukhi"\u000a(Goudamalhar) and "Vanchatomune"\u000a(Karnaranjani), and\u000aThyagaraja's "Nagumomu" (Abheri)\u000atrod very plain paths.\u000aEncouraging\u000a"Banturithi" (Hamsanada),\u000a"Maa Janaki" (Kamboji - both of\u000aThyagaraja) featuring short alapanas\u000aand few strains of swarakalpana,\u000aflashed for a moment\u000aencouraging impressions of gaining\u000anecessary momentum.\u000aOf the 14 numbers, a neraval (at\u000a"Munimanasa") appeared only in\u000a"Rama Rama Gunaseema" (Simhendramadhyama\u000a- Swathi Thirunal).In the alapana section, she admirably\u000aimbued into the sancharas\u000aall the features essential for a\u000aclear identification of the raga;\u000ayet, much of its substance remained\u000aunexplored.Other highlights - Purandaradasa's\u000a"Chandrachuda" (Darbari\u000aKaanada) and "Raagi Tandira"\u000a(Tilang), Vadiraja's "Govinda"\u000a(Ragamalika), and Vasudevacharya's\u000aTillana (Kannada).* * *M.A. Jyothi (Ganabharathi) sang,\u000aaccompanied by Aditi Krishna\u000aPrakash (violin) and G. S. Kumar\u000a(mridanga). This artiste's voice\u000awas supple and melodious, but\u000athe progressions lacked consistency.\u000aAt times, exceptional tonal\u000aqualities faced downward trends,\u000aeither for want of vigour or for no\u000aapparent reason.Meanings of the lyrics successfully\u000areached the audience,\u000athrough clear diction supplemented\u000aby melodic nilugades,\u000abringing them under the influence\u000aof the expected moods.The first two presentations -\u000a"Maruva" (varna - Amrithavarshini\u000a- Yoganarasimha) and "Mahaganapathim"\u000a(Amrithavaahini\u000a- Jayachamaraja Wadiyar) may be\u000aquoted as fitting examples substantiating\u000aher plus points: a majestic\u000aprogression accompanied\u000aby admirable graces featured both\u000athe compositions.With the rest of the concert,\u000aone could find occasional, but\u000aperceptible traces of instability,\u000aand as a natural sequel, the sancharas\u000abetrayed signs of imbalance.\u000aMuffled inflections marred\u000athe mandra sancharas.She interpreted Thyagaraja's\u000a"Ragarathna Maalikache" (Rithigaula)\u000aand Subbayya Shastri's\u000a"Nipaadamule Gathi" (Bhairavi)\u000aembellishing them with pleasing\u000aalapana, impressive neraval and\u000ascholarly swarakalpanas. As the\u000alatter happened to be the focus, it\u000aincidentally comprised a tani avarathana.\u000aLiberal employment of\u000aartistic imagination would have\u000aburnished her scholarly competence\u000atransforming the endeavours\u000ainto a distinctly bright\u000aaccomplishment.Other presentations were\u000a"Dhayarani" (Mohana-Thyagaraja),\u000a"Shri Kamakshi" (Saaranga -\u000aAnnayaswamy Shastri - with a\u000ashort alapana), "Annapurne Vishalakshi"\u000a(Saama - Dikshitar) and\u000aso on.One common factor that undermined\u000aboth the above concerts\u000awas frequent references to\u000anotes. This substantially jeopardised\u000ainvolvement, wherein spontaneous\u000aflow of both mood and\u000aartistry were at stake.
