VLALITHAA KRISHNANA compilation of post-Trinity compositions that included several rare pieces, was presented by the artistes who performed during the three-day series organised by the Saraswathi Vaggeyakara Trust.The concluding day featured the vocal recital of Gayathri Sankaran, followed by the Mayavaram sisters, Uma and Geetha. The thrust was on spotlighting the compositions, and quite rightly so, with elements of raga, neraval and kalpanaswara playing a more subdued role.Her piercing voice negotiating sangatis and octaves with fluid ease, Gayathri Sankaran's grammar-friendly interpretation of Urmika proceeded along disciplined lines. The beautifully styled Pallavi Sesha Iyer kriti, ``Enthani vina vindura" (Adi, tisra gati) exuded sophistication right down to the chittaswaram with its fascinating variations in the concluding line. A brief neraval and kalpanaswaram with catchy permutations completed the picture. Muthaiah Bhagavathar's ``Raja raja radhite" (Niroshta) and Papanasam Sivan's ``Swamikku sari" (Kedaragowla) were rendered with feeling and restraint. Economy of expression marked the crisp essay of Mohanam that led to the central piece, Mysore Vasudevachar's ``Ra ra rajeevalochana," a repository of the raga's evergreen appeal. Given the artiste's neat execution of speedy passages, she could have enhanced their impact by toning down the slightly aggressive edge to her brigas. The swaraprastharas were laced with apt vadi-samvadi poruttams.The sangatis in the light pieces, namely, Ambujam Krishna's ``Enna solli" (Kanada), Saathur Karpagam's ``Nayaki nee" (Chandrakauns) and Lalgudi Jayaraman's tillana in Khamas, were mellow with sensitive structuring.Esoteric appealThe Mayavaram sisters, Uma and Geetha, commenced with Muthaiah Bhagavathar's elegant Suddha Dhanyasi varnam before moving on to ``Ranganathude" (Saurashtram) invested with due solemnity. Koteesvara Iyer's ``Arul seiyya vendum" Rasikapriya) brimmed with an esoteric appeal all its own.The seldom-encountered Muthaiah Bhagavathar composition in Madhyamavathi, `Sree Rama', with a high-impact chittaswaram, took the fast track. Bhairavi, elaborated at length, was a busy fretwork, full of movement, the kriti being Swathi Tirunal's ``Janani." Patnam Subramania Iyer's ``Ninnu jeppa karanamemi" featured stimulating neraval with brisk single-avartana kalpanaswaras adding spice.Khambodi was met with a mature, unhurried approach and the Kavi Kunjara Bharathi kriti ``Ivan yaaro" was rounded off with neraval and swaras.K.P. Nandini (violin) and R. Sankaranarayanan (mridangam) who provided accompaniment for both concerts were unobtrusive and displayed perception.Bottom Template Starts
