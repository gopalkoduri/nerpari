VOne enjoyed every bit of  Sharbari Banerjee&#8217;s recent Hindustani  vocal  as part of the  HCL Concert Series. There were adequate indications of her scholarly and artistic abilities during the performance. To commence her recital of the evening w\u000aith a khayal in raga Shyam Kalyan set to a slow paced  12-beat Ek tala, followed up with a tarana in drut Teen tala was rather good. The khayal &#8220;Shyam tori chitwan&#8221; was elaborated with ably deployed alap-badhat, which contained scores of well-knit taans and sargams. Her enunciation of the  textual contents  was very neat and crisp. The tarana that followed was  well structured   and very well rendered.Her next rendering was in the Carnatic raga Hamsadhwani. Sharbari, who did her Doctorate in Music from Delhi University on the &#8220;Evolution of Ragas through the distinctive treatment in different Gharanas&#8221;, under Professor Debu Chaudhuri, deserves to be complimented for singing Hamsadhwani without any tinge of the Carnatic idiom. Most of the Hindustani singers present this raga with the touch of Dikshitar&#8217;s composition &#8220;Vatapi Ganapatim&#8221;. She presented &#8220;He maato sharde&#8221; in the seven-beat Rupak tala with pleasing nuances,  correctly maintaining the raga&#8217;s format.Sharbari was initiated into music by her mother  Joyshree Banerjee and later  taught by Dr. Johri of the Kirana gharana. She had further training  under  Anita Roy of the Rampur Seheswan gharana, and  currently is receiving further guidance under Pandit Bholanath Mishra in Khayal, Dadra, Kajri, Thumri and Bhajan.Light classicalHaving rendered two raga-based numbers, it was nice on the singer&#8217;s part to switch over to light classical renderings. The dadra in Mishra Khamaj &#8220;Koyaliya mat kare pukar&#8221; was sung with intense melodic charm, and so was the sawani, &#8220;Barase kaari re badariya&#8221;.She had excellent accompaniment on the sarangi by the veteran player Pandit Bharat Bhushan Goswami and on the tabla by Ashish Balakar.
