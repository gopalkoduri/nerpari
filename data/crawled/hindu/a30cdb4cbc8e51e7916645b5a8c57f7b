VThe concluding day&#8217;s session at the Music Academy&#8217;s TTK Auditorium commenced with Svanubhava&#8217;s theme music, composed by Arun Prakash and a prayer followed by a violin recital by students of CARVA Trust. It was a violin ensemble of 4\u000a4 fledglings &#8212; children who combined well and were focused on their task of providing music in its simplest form.The songs, Shakthi Sahitha Ganapathim, Ramabakthi Samrajya, SaraSaraSamarai, Kurai Ondrum Illai, Note Swaram, Raghupathi Raghava, Saare Jahan Se Achcha and Bagyadha Lakshmi seemed to be a pragmatic choice made by their Guru, C A Rajasekhar.  Two more youngsters, Sumesh Narayanan (mridangam) and S. Krishnan (ghatam) provided laya support.T.V. Sankaranarayanan began with a long slokam prefacing Jaya Jaya Padmanabha in Charukesi. He then rendered &#8220;Sri Mathrubootham&#8221; in Kannada and followed it with alapanas of Kalyani (Himathrisuthe) and Kapi (Intha Sowkhya) that were interspersed with Madurai Mani Iyer&#8217;s dearest phrases and then rounded off his concert with a brisk.   He was  accompanied by Chandramouli (violin), Harikumar (mridangam) and Anirudh (ganjira).From the moment she picked up her veena, Jayanthi Kumaresh was able to hold the audience in a trance. Nattakurinji&#8217;s lingering phrases for &#8220;Parvathi Kumaram&#8221; and the song Aparadha Mula Norva in Rasaali expressed music in its finest imaginative form.The RTP (in Shanmukhapriya) phase and the ragamalika swaras that followed saw the stunning shift in ragas (Sivaranjani, Ghambira Nattai, Vasantha and Vasanthi)  in a seamless  manner.The lyrics of Jayanthi&#8217;s own pallavi pertained to the very theme of Svanubhava: &#8220;Vaibhavam Anubhavam Svanubhavam Iyal Iasi Inaindha Vaibhavam Svanubhavam.&#8221; She was accompanied by Neyveli Narayanan (mridangam) and Giridhar Uduppa (ghatam).
