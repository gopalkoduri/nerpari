VRanjini and Gayathri sang as part of three-day annual music festival of Shri Thyagaraja - Purandaradasa Aradhana Celebrations (N.R. Mohalla Sangeetha Sabha), accompanied by Charumati (violin), Manoj Siva (mridanga) and G.S. Ramanujam (ghata).The singers are endowed with resilient voices in addition to a fine timbre that can remain consistent in any octave suitable for melodic expressions.Nevertheless, Gayathri's voice exhibited signs of constraints in the higher octaves as was evident from frequent the split, particularly in faster tempo. Of the two factors &#8212; melody (related more with the sweetness of one's voice and the style of narration) and the emotions (connected more with the spiritual aspects intended by the composers) &#8212; the former appeared to cast a strong influence over major part of the concert. In this regard, &#8220;Bhut Mote&#8221; (abhang), as an exception, stood for intense expressions of devotion.&#8220;Enu Madidarenu&#8221; (Purandaradasa - Hindola), &#8220;Sugunamule&#8221; (Chakravaka &#8211; Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Venkatashaila&#8221; (Hamir &#8211; Subbaraya Shastri) emerged with rich melodic airs fortified by meaningful intonations. Alapanas in Chakravaka and Hamir substantially realised their respective moods.The audience sensed and enjoyed their scholarship and competence in every stage of Thyagaraja's &#8220;Koluvaiyunnade&#8221; (Bhairavi): alapana methodically developed, the composition narrated clearly, a neraval imaginatively enlarged and swarakalpana aptly beautifying the composition. Tani avarthana too established a harmonised relationship between rhythm intricacies and melodic aspects.The concert included other interesting numbers like &#8220;Harismarane&#8221; (Yamunakalyani &#8211; Purandaradasa), &#8220;Nanati Bathuku&#8221; (Revathi &#8211; Annamacharya) and &#8220;Bhagyadalakshmi&#8221; (Purandaradasa)***Ragavaibhava presented Dakshayini, an absorbing and vivifying characterisation by Vasundhara Doraswamy. Udyavara Madhavacharya has penned the lyrics and P. Rama has set the tune.The dancer's treasured repertoire was able to carry the spectators to immense heights.There were sequences of touching moments, when the heroine Dakshayini had to face humiliations and ignominy when her husband Shiva was deliberately omitted from the list of the invitees for the Daksha Yagna. The lyrics shone with impressive metaphors, and subtle rhymes ornamented them. Yet, the general theme was inundated with pathetic sequences, exaggerated more than was necessary and suffered from an overpowering grand eloquence.The dancer's aesthetic sense in interspersing the narrative sequences with neatly plaited pure dance sections, considerably mitigating undue influences of such embarrassing melancholy, worked as a welcome compensatory mechanism.Proportion, restraint and classicism characterised the abhinaya sections, and the choreographer's (Vasundhara) discretion honed by refined artistry was evident when she had incorporated, dovetailed and decorated minute details of expressions with attractive jathis, so that there was not a moment of either slackness or sloppiness.Attractive postures assumed with utmost delicacy and ease, and smoothly flowing stage activities invariably maintained consistency. The performance reached climax when ecstatic expressions emanating from the dancer impressively consummated the heroin's excruciating mental agony, undaunted determination and unparalleled divinity in immolating herself (Dakshayini) in the yogic fire she invoked.Udyavara Madhavacharya and Vijaya (narration of prose sections), P. Rama (vocal), Sandesh Bhargav (nattuvanga), R. Raghunandan (flute), Narayana (violin), Janardana Rao (mridanga) and Prasanna Kumar (rhythm pad) constituted the music ensemble.
