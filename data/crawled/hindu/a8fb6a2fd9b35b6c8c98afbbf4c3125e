VAlamelu Mani&#8217;s concert came as a revelation. Her solid approach to her music afforded it a refreshing dimension.  The degree of confidence and composure shown by Alamelu Mani made a difference. Her voice was &#8216;both humble and hushed&#8217;\u000a and music seemed to be a habit with her.A soft varnam in Sahana lead to two Sadguru kritis &#8212; &#8216;Theratheyagaradha&#8217; (Gowlipanthu) and &#8216;Nee Bhakti&#8217; (Jayamanohari) &#8212; which had a brief round of swaras  done with a sense of relish.One got to  listen to four alapanas, Poorvikalyani (&#8216;Ninnu Vina&#8217;), Anandha Bhairavi, Hindolam and Kiravani, in that order. The idea visualised is to make the audience &#8216;arrive&#8217; &#8212; put them in a prepared state where the mind becomes receptive to alapanas.If the opening phrase for Kiravani (&#8216;Kaligiunte Kadha&#8217;, Tyagaraja) dug out of her imagination stayed with you, the remaining three alapanas were at par for their quality and occupied enough concert space to give a sense of fulfilment. The swara rendering had a control (nidhanam) even during the speedy sections.Listeners were in for a treat when three padams/javalis &#8212; &#8216;Mosamaye&#8217; (Ahiri), &#8216;Valaputhaasa&#8217; (Varali) and &#8216;Vaani Pondhu&#8217; (Kaanada) &#8212; were rendered.These form a genre of our music where there is a pleasurable blend of supreme bhava, lovable lyric and raga nuances, and Alamelu Mani perhaps exemplified the will of the composers as she rendered them in style.The choice of &#8216;Pattam Katta Etravandi&#8217; (Ramanukku Mannan, Arunachala Kavi, Hindolam) for niraval seemed rather asymmetrical to the tenor of this kutcheri as this line (and the song too) does not favour vilamba kala elaborations.&#8216;Paramapurusham&#8217; (Lalitha Panchamam, Swati Tirunal) and a Tiruppugazh &#8216;Abakara Nindhai&#8217; in Sandha Thalam were also included.Sarayu Srinivasan&#8217;s involved vocal support performed its reinforcing function.Ganesh Prasad on the violin, always grasping before he ventures, created some smooth phrases in all the alapanas  sustaining the overall aura of the concert, and answered well in the swara segment.Ganapathy Raman on the mridangam showed the virtues of subdued laya accompaniment, while running his rhythm for the three padams/javalis and also by adhering to the pace of &#8216;Tyagaraja Yoga Vaibhavam&#8217;, both in letter and in spirit. His tani was impressive on the whole.Nadha Inbam (Raga Sudha) had organised this concert in memory of Dilip Veeraraghavan, a contemporary connoisseur of music.
