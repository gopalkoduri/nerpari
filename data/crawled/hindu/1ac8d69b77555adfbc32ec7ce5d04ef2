VHARISH BALSanthanagopalan covered the myriad hues of Hamir Kalyani in an alaapana and a pallavi.Neyveli Santhanagopalan is less intobrigasand the mathematics of music. He enjoys exploring thelakshyaaspect of music in his concerts.His concert programme, conducted under the auspices of Rasikapriya, Kochi, last week, began with a Sahana varnam `Karunimpa,' for which he had shortswaraphrases. He sang a variety of swaras for Mayamalavagowla kriti `Tulaseedalamulache.' The singer also played with the phrase `jatakoorchi nataka' in the popular Ravichandrika raga kriti, `Makelaravicharamu' with akarams and neraval, giving it a fast pace.He brought out the poetry in `Marivere dikkevaramma,' by exploring Ananda bhairavi.The slow paced alaapana, with long sustained notes was characteristic of Santhanagopalan's alaapana of Bilahari. He also delved on the lower octaves. Edapally Ajith Kumar, on the violin, laid bare the basic essence of this raga through few fine phrases and soon came the compliment to him from the vocalist. (`It was short and sweet').This was followed by a sleek rendition of `Doraguna ituvanti seva', a composition of Tyagaraja. Many vakra usages, `dha ni ga' et al in the low octave made a Kharaharapriya delineation special. All the six sangatis of `Chakkani raja' were sung with utmost precision.The thaniyavarthanam from Trivandrum Vaidyanathan and Gopinathaprabhu, was well coordinated.Wide repertoireSanthanagopalan covered the myriad hues of Hamir Kalyani in an alaapana and a pallavi. He took ragas Neelambari, Ahiri, Kathanakuthoohalam and Ranjini one by one for the swara essays and later blended two each with much ease and felicity. He gave a virutham `Yogeendranam' and after remarking it was a bit odd to follow it up with a Siva sthuthi, went for `Chandrachooda' in Darbari Kanada, as it was a request from the audience.Santhanagopalan wound up the concert with `Saramainamatalentho' the Telugu javali by Swati Tirunal and `Manathirkugandhadhu Muruganin Roopam' by Thanjavur Sankara Iyer in Sindhubhairavi raga.Bottom Template Starts
