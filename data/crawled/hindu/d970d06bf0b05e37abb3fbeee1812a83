VShe was accompanied by the violinist and mridangam duo - N.C.Anantha Krishna and Karra Srinivasa Rao respectively - who complemented with their own effort the lack of the needed punch. Anantha Krishna&#8217;s responses to each of the vocalist&#8217;s presentation ofragaorswarabrought in the flavour. Karra Srinivasa Rao provided rhythmic beats to the song andswarasas well. Radha gave a traditional opening to her concert with avarnamin Vachaspati (Sarasudavani) - a rare one, that of Patnam.And the invocation to Lord Ganesha too was a rare one. Her choice wasNamami Vighna Vinayakain Hamsadhwani of Krishnaswamayya in Tisragati.Neebhajanagana Rasikulain Nayaki of Thyagaraja turned out to be an impressive rendition in the opening part of her concert. She then essayed her firstragaof the concert - Panthuvarali - which she delineated with ease and care.Mysore Vasudevachar&#8217;sSankarininnein Pantuvarali, Misrachaputalam, had the ingredients of a reasonably goodnerevaland briskswarakalpana. Then came,Jaya Jaya Padmanabhaof Swati Tirunal in Manirangu. Then there was Kharaharapriyaragaessay too forSrinivasa Tavacharanam, Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s composition. She evolvedraga Shanmukhapriyafor herragam-tanam-pallavieffort, which shaped up well. In fact, she came into perfect mood in these last two important numbers. Thepallavishe did was in Khandajati Triputa and theswaraprastharawas done in theragamalikaformat. Thepallavirendition andswarakalpanawere remarkable.Ragadelineation also made some impact.
