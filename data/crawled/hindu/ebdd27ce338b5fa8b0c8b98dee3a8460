VA specially conceived &#8216;Double Delite-A Mix &#8216;n' Match' programme by SAFE featured several pairings of artists for 10 days. They included sisters, brothers, mother-daughter, father-son, husband and wife and even cousins.The last day of the series was a family affair. At Subha Ganesan's vocal concert, father V.M. Ganesan played the mridangam and mother Kalyani Ganesan was on the veena. The only outsider was violinist S.B. Ananthapadmanabha. Subha has trained under MLV and invariably displays a good command over the content of her concerts.Beauty of MohanamIn this programme, Subha's Mohanam was fixed on a strong base and was dealt with in great detail for Tyagaraja's &#8216;Nannu Palimpa.' Her raga sketches were presented with ease and elegance.It was quite a good raga treatise where Mohanam was explored fully to showcase its inherent beauty.Earlier Subha sang Pantuvarali for Swati Tirunal's &#8216;Paripalaya Saraseeruha Lochana.' The brevity of the raga essay did not affect the vibrant melody as she was wise enough to bring out the best of the raga.The swara segments in Pantuvarali and Mohanam carried full impetus but at the same time one could not but feel the extra length of the kizh kala swaras in Mohanam bordering on meandering syllables sans focus even after a well structured niraval on &#8216;Karamuna Chara Kothandakanthi.' A few more brisk mel kala swaras would have been better.Kalyani Ganesan's veena support was almost effaced partly by the violin and the improper audio balancing. Nevertheless, she made her presence noticeable in the Dhanyasi kriti, some swara sections and an enchanting thanam for Mohanam.Ananthapadmanabha on the violin was fully focussed and admirably crisp in his approach. Ganesan's percussion was a tad coarse.Surprisingly, the recently renovated Sastri Hall in Mylapore is back to its original status of a grim picture within a short period.The air conditioners were mute, the false roofing showed gaping holes, and the audio balancing was in total disarray.The artists had to brave these technical glitches to make their concert impressive. Indeed a daunting task!
