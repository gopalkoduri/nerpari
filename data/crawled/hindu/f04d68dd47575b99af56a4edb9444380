VYamandu Costa looks like a teen out to have some fun with his guitar &#8211; baby-faced, glossy hair, constantly shifting his feet on the footstool in front of him, almost dancing in his chair, breaking into a whistle in the middle of a composition. But then, he&#8217;s also one of the leading, mature and much-acclaimed guitarists in Brazil, playing a big role in popularising indigenous Brazilian folk music all over, armed with a seven-string guitar.The 29-year-old performed at Azad Bhavan in New Delhi recently, accompanied by musicians Roberta Cunha Valente (tambourine), Danilo Ezequiel Brito de Macedo (mandolin) and Rogerio Caetano de Almeida (also on a seven-string guitar). The Indian Council of Cultural Relations and Embassy of Brazil hosted the event.Choro (meaning &#8216;cry&#8217; or &#8216;lament&#8217;), perhaps the earliest known form of music known to Brazil and chiefly instrumental, was the genre performed. Cheerful, complicated and unconventional at times, with the tambourine the only percussion used, the quartet received a standing ovation from the audience when it ended.&#8220;The intention was to show the audience what Choro is, so we played a combination of fast and slower pieces,&#8221; says Yamandu, who came to Delhi last year too. &#8220;Almost everything we played was an original composition. This is music that is the forte of the people of Brazil and instruments are most important.&#8221;This is the first time that the four are touring together. &#8220;Each of us has his or her own independent career. We are from different cities of Brazil and came to know each other through music. We decided to get together to tour India,&#8221; he adds. Delhi is the group&#8217;s first stop in India, after which they are scheduled to play in Kolkata, Guwahati and Chennai.Back in Brazil, Yamandu is nicknamed &#8216;Tupi Guarani&#8217;, which translates to &#8216;Precursor of the Waters of the World&#8217; in the native tongue of the Brazilian Indians. Besides Choro, Yamandu has also mastered other forms of Brazilian music, like Bossa Nova, Milonga, Tango, Samba and Chamame.&#8220;I grew up near the Brazil-Argentina border, which was a very Latin foundation. I listened to a lot of Argentine music, a lot of jazz and a lot of classical,&#8221; recalls Yamandu. When he was 17, Yamandu played at the Sao Paulo festival and since then it was only going ahead.For their contribution to Choro, Yamandu holds Pixinguinha and Jacob do Bandolim in great regard. &#8220;What they did for Brazilian music is unmatched,&#8221; he says.In 2007 Mika Kaurismaki also made a documentary on Yamandu, titledBrasileirinho.Brasileirinho, incidentally, was also the name of the last composition that the quartet performed at Azad Bhavan. &#8220;The documentary played an important role in telling people outside Brazil about me and my music,&#8221; Yamandu acknowledges.
