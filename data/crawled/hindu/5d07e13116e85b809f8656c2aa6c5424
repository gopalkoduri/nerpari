VShrikant G. sang at Ganabharathi accompanied by H.K. Narasimha Murthy (violin), Nataraj (mridanga) and Manjunath (ghata).His concert imprinted on the minds of the listeners a pleasing experience, substantially fortified by refinement.Having an ability to span over the necessary three octaves, retaining good consistency and timbre, he was able to present the compositions with remarkable ease, carefully preserving delicate and distinctive flavours of both the lyrics and the ragas.However, while picking up the strains of the lyrics, the stress accent he exerts on the commencing words, for a moment, disturbs the tune.He enjoys the lyrics and so meaningfully enriches his renderings, whether a varna, a thevaram or a devaranama.&#8220;Vanajakshi&#8221; (varna - Kalyani- Puchi Shrinivasa Iyengar), in two speeds, conveyed the purport of the lyrics and sweetness of the raga. In spite of the simplicity, which characterised his narrative style, there was no dearth of intricacies and terseness a varna demanded.&#8220;Gambhiranata&#8221; (thevaram - Thiru Jnana Sambandhar) was a rare musical experience, carrying one to a nostalgic era of traditional temple music. We wished that we understood Tamil for an appreciation in its entirety.Similar was the listeners&#8217; experience in &#8220;Brovavamma&#8221; (Maanji - Shyama Shastri) and &#8220;Balasubrahmanyam bhajeham&#8221; (Suruti- Dikshitar).The latter one comprised an alapana, a neraval at &#8220;Velayudhadharam&#8221; and passages of kalpanaswaras.The imaginative artiste included in his schedule a swarajati (Valajapetai Venkataramana Bhagavathar).Two compositions that he sang later &#8212; &#8220;Paalisayya&#8221; of Gopaladasa and &#8220;Yahi madhava&#8221; of Jayadeva, tuned in ragas Sudhaparimala and Shrikara &#8212; vouched for his versatility.Elaborate alapana in Kalyani, composed progression of the lyrics &#8220;Pahimam shri vagishwari&#8221; (Swathy Thirunal), meaningful elaboration of charana at &#8220;Darunadhikara&#8221;, and fluently framed kalpanaswaras culminated in gently resonated thani avarthana.V.
