VIt is to the credit of Pandit Shivakumar Sharma that a folk instrument like the santoor was elevated to the status of a full-fledged concert instrument. Dedicated hard work, rich musical imagination and a subtle understanding of classical Hindustani \u000amusic are the pre-requisites for anyone who wishes to master this instrument.Pandit Sharma also needs to be given credit for training several talented students to perpetuate his mission.Pandit Satish Vyas, son of a noted classic vocalist Pandit C.R. Vyas, is prominent among them. Satish has imbibed the nuances of santoor playing, and has further enhanced it with his originality of approach. His concert at Bangalore Gayana Samaja during its music conference was melodic and scholarly. Inspiringly accompanied on the tabla by Pandit Ravindra Yavagal, he took the audience on a joyous journey of unpolluted melody. A refined grip over the instrument, nuanced fusion of layakari and tantrakari, unpretentious and precise renditions, and emotionally charged  exposition greeted us.The delineation of Miyan Ki Malhar, a monsoon raga was a topical selection. The raga bloomed to its fullest glory, in a stage by stage evolution, through compositions set to jhaptal, madhyalaya teental, and drut ektal. The following Keeravani raga found its authentic form and structure in its explication in madhyalaya and drut laya compositions. The meends and artistic gats in the tristhayi expanse won him audience appreciation.*** The president of this year&#8217;s music conference Pandit Rajiv Taranath is perhaps the only south Indian sarod maestro. His sarod concert, with the young and seasoned Udayaraj Karpoor extending a lively and merited tabla support, was contemplative.Taranath is a gifted disciple of Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. The artiste not only remembered his guru but also saluted him by rendering raga Chandranandan, a creation of his Guru. The beauty of the raga was captured in an impressive instrumental play. The presentation of the raga was marked by a meditative quality. The confluence of bhava, raga and tala was perfect and rewarding. Rajiv Taranath positively and cooly responded to a request for rendition of Hamsadhwani raga from the audience by incorporating it into his ragamala rendition. Unperturbed by a sound amplification problem, he went on to serve the rasikas with his fine music. The ragas, including Hamsadhwani, were short, sweet and sensitive.*** Multifariously talented and seasoned singer Sangeetha Katti Kulkarni&#8217;s vocal recital held at Sri Karya Siddhi Mantapa, Girinagar, recently in connection with the chaturmasa vratha of Sri Datta Vijayananda Teertha Swamiji produced music which was too good to be true. Sangeetha is blessed with a honeyed voice, which maintains a broad open &#8216;aakar&#8217;, giving no room for any kind of repression, and without ever lessening its euphony or appeal. The management of the voice and the manner of articulation are praiseworthy.The singer&#8217;s tremendous achievement, appeal and potential are remarkable. There was an incessant flow of music throughout her recital.With Ravindra Katoti (harmonium), Udayaraj Karpoor (tabla), and Keshava Joshi (special effects) ornamenting her singing, Sangeetha unravelled the beauties of the compositions of Sri Sachichidananda Ganapathi Swamiji and his mother Mathru Sri Jayalakshmi Matha and a couple of Haridasa padas.A solid foundation was laid to the concert with a classical cheez &#8220;Mana sumaratha nisa dina tumhare naam&#8221; set to a captivating Bairagi Bhairav raga. Then the rasikas were treated to the moving renditions of &#8220;Suvarchalamba&#8221; (Pooriya Kalyan), &#8220;Karamugida moolaprana&#8221; (Purandaradasa, Adhana), and others. A thoroughly enjoyable melodic world was opened up.
