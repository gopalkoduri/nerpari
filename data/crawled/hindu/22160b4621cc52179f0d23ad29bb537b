VNarayana Tirtha Day was organised by The Music Academy and held at the Kasthuri Srinivasan Hall on April 29. Dr. Pappu Venugopal Rao, who dwelt on the life of the saint composer,  said Tirtha composed in his own unique style extensively and mainly in\u000a Sanskrit, and his Krishna Leela Tharangini has as its base the 10th canto of the Bhagavatham. Each chapter of the Tharangini is known as a Tharangam, and the name Tharangam has now come to be identified with the works of this composer. He has 153 compositions to his credit (extrapolated to 157) and the ragas chosen were Khambodi, Nadha Namakriya, Saurashtram, Madhyamavathi and the less popular ragas of that time (1635 to 1745 was his period) namely Mangala Kapi, Useni, Khamas and Poorvikalyani. Narayana Tirtha also had extraordinary knowledge of Natya Sastra and his compositions were a glowing and breathtaking combination of music, spiritualism, dance and drama.Introducing the performer, Sampathkumar, Pappu Venugopal Rao said that he hails from the Ghorakavi family, which happens to be one of the 60 families that has the distinction of having learnt Tirtha&#8217;s songs directly from the vaaggeyakara, and added that in that sense, the effort taken by The Music Academy to bring Sampathkumar here to perform was a laudable one.Sampathkumar (of Hyderabad)  presented a judicious combination of those handled elaborately in kutcheris and those that are rendered as bhajans &#8212; normal versions that could be easily followed. He commenced with &#8216;Jaya Jaya Swamin&#8217; and then rendered a special Tharangam on Narayana Tirtha  in the raga Hamsadhwani. The popular &#8216;Sharanam Bhava Karunamayi&#8217; was sung in Arabhi and the line &#8216;Vara Noopura Dhara Sundaradhara&#8217; saw intelligent handling, where the padam was split  to retain its lyrical beauty and yet conveyed its meaning effectively.The childhood deeds (Bala Leela) of Krishna came in the form of the song &#8216;Bala Krishnam Kalayasaki Sundaram&#8217; and the next song, &#8216;Jaya Jaya Rama Natha&#8217; was in praise of Lord Venkateswara. Narayana Tirtha was an ardent devotee of Narasimha and Venkateswara. &#8216;Balagopala&#8217; in Mohanam came next with an alapana and it was mentioned that this song with its many charanams was sung through the night and would get completed in the wee hours.&#8216;Govardhana Giridhara Govinda&#8217; in Hindolam was prefaced with an alapana which was followed by &#8216;Puraya Mama Kaamam&#8217;. This second song is an integral part of the samparadaya bhajan  and was rendered at a brisk pace. The other compositions were &#8216;Madhava Madhava Krishna&#8217;, &#8216;Madhu Sudhana Anantha Vedhathri Sikara&#8217; (Khambodi) and a final composition on Goddess Durga of Vijayawada.Sampathkumar was accompanied on the violin by Kalaiarasan and on the mridangam by Nellai Kannan. The programme was held under the endowment of P. Obul Reddy.
