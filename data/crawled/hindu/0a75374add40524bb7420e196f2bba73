VIn connection with the Shadkala Govinda Marar Sangeethotsav, a grand concert was held in the evening at its auditorium in Ramamangalam in Ernakulam district.Legend has it that Govinda Marar, who could sing in six kalas (shadkala), once visited Tyagaraja, the great icon of Carnatic music and spent a night with him illustrating the contours of raga Nilambari.The inaugural function was followed by Madurai T.N. Seshagopalan's (T.N.S.) concert. The concert, which started with &#8216;Devadeva kalayamite,' the popular Swati Tirunal composition inRoopaka tala, was distinct for its swara passages. The veteran vocalist's take of Mayamalavagoula was welcomed it with applause. His musical prowess charmed the listeners when he rendered the rare Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Jayaju' in Ganavaridhi, a janya raga of Soolini. The kriti was set in a slow pace.In praise of MararIt was followed by &#8216;Entharo mahanubhavalu,' a Tyagaraja composition in Sriraga. It is believed that Tyagaraja sang the song in praise of Govinda Marar. Its superb raga sancharas enthralled the audience. Each swara carried a unique bhava.&#8216;Venkita saila vihara' in Amirkalyani, set to Adi tala, the next piece that the singer took up, was a real treat for listeners. Seshagopalan's mastery over the raga and his voice control were praiseworthy.The highlight of the concert was &#8216;Govardhana gireesam &#8216;in Hindolam, a well-known composition by Muthuswami Dikshitar. The kriti in Roopaka tala was presented with a lot of innovations. The blossoming of the raga could be well experienced with the fine support of Edappilly Ajith on the violin. TNS elaborated it with great vivacity; he began the kriti with a sloka &#8216;Kalam kalmashachitta.' The tani avartanam was a delightful exercise in team work by G.Chandrasekharan Nair (mridangam) and Perukavu Sudheer (ghatam).Syama Sastri's &#8216;Ambaneelayathakshi' in Neelambari, set to Adi tala, was followed by &#8216;Melukovayya,' a composition by Tyagaraja. The kriti in Bouli raga, was set to Khandachap tala. The melody was highly devotional and its arohana and avarohana enthralled the audience. It was wound up by a sloka &#8216;Sayamkale vananthe' in ragamalika. Its varying pitches and portrayal of navarasas plumbed the depths of melody and rhythm.He ended the concert with a rare thillana and a thiruppukal in Hamsanandi. &#8216;Pavamana' in Sriraga and a sloka on Srivenkita provided the right finishing touches to the concert.Exemplary professionalismThe professionalism of the team of musicians made the three-hour concert an unforgettable experience for rasikas. The violin carefully followed the vocalist while the mridangam and the ghatam came up with a spectacular performance.The inaugural function was marked by a Shadkala geetam composed by Kadungallur Narayanan.The three-day festival was organised by Kerala Sangeeta Nataka Academy in association with Shadkala Govindamarar Smaraka Samiti, Ramamangalam.
