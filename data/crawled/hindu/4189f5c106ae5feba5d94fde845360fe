VThushar M.K. became a household name thanks to a music-based reality show on television. A disciple of B. Sasikumar, Thushar's sound base in classical music helped him make a mark in the talent hunt. His Carnatic vocal concert in Kochi helped him highlight his prowess in classical music.The concert, which started with the Ada tala varnam &#8216;Sarasijanabha' inraga Kamboji, was noted for its emphasis on manodharma and chaste kriti renditions. Overall, the concert gave the vocalist the opportunity to show his vidwat and repertoire.He followed the initial piece with the Amrithavarshini composition &#8216;Sidhivinayakam Vighnanashakam,' which was adorned with kalpanaswaras.Clear sangatis&#8216;Marivere dikkevaru' in Latangi raga, Khanda chappu tala, was sung with clear sangatis and steady tempo.This was complemented by Mavelikkara Balachandran on the mridangam.Fiery brigas at lightning speed beautified a relatively simple raga Karnaranjani. Detailed swaras, marked by steady progression, were sung well for Muthaiah Bhagavathar's composition &#8216;Vanchathonuna.' It was a phase when the vocalist was at his expressive best. The raga, which relies heavily on &#8216;madhyama' as its jeeva swara, was rendered with the right bhava.Raga bhava of TodiHis elaboration of Todi underscored the raga bhava to the core and it displayed the vocal prowess of the artiste in full bloom. Right from phrase one, the structure of the raga was firmly established. The composition &#8216;Dasarathi nee rinamu,' in which Tyagaraja thanks the Lord for bringing him fame in distant lands, was presented with finesse. His niraval was not just a &#8216;line repetition' exercise, but one that displayed immense flexibility and scope of the raga. The rendition of the swaras was systematic and progressive, yet the spontaneity was not missing. Ambalapuzha Pradeep whose bowing remained bleak till this phase, rose to the demands of the main piece and gave a neat elaboration of the raga.Trikkakara Shantaram on the ganjira came good in the taniavarthanam. Coordination between the percussionists shaped a good tani.&#8216;Ramamantrava Japiso' in Jonpuri and &#8216;Narahari deva' in Yamuna Kalyani raga were sung towards the end of the concert. The programme was organised by Rasikapriya.
