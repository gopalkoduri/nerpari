VVols 1-5 and Vols 6-10, 5-CD pack each.RPG; Rs. 545 each.Some things never go out of fashion. Like Hindi film songs from the golden era of the 1940s, 1950s and the 1960s. And who better than the unmistakable voice of Ameen Sayani to re-introduce those hits all over again to a new generation!Yes, this is the same Sayani of &#8216;Binaca (later Cibaca) Geetmala&#8217; fame, whose words &#8216;Behanon aur Bhaiyon&#8217; meant it was melody time for music lovers across the globe who would be glued to Radio Ceylon on Wednesday evenings at 8 p.m. Sayani, who finds a place in the Limca Book of Records for hosting over 54,000 radio shows and doing voice-overs for 19,000 ads, is back with two 5-CD packs of all those songs which were featured on his much-admired radio show.&#8216;Geetmala Ki Chhaon Mein&#8217; is truly a collector&#8217;s delight. Each pack presents five volumes and each CD has about 10-15 songs, some of which have become cult classics. Like &#8216;Man dole&#8217; (Nagin) which topped the charts for two years!As it is not possible to list every song, here&#8217;s a sample of what&#8217;s in store in each volume: The musical journey begins with Vol-1 and the evergreen &#8216;Jane Ne Nazar&#8217; (Aah), &#8216;Mohe Bhool Gaye Saawariya&#8217; (Baiju Bawra) and &#8216;Piya Milan Ko Jana&#8217; (Kapal Kundala). Vol 2 has &#8216;Bachpan ke Din Bhula Ne Dena&#8217; (Deedar) and &#8216;Tu Ganga ki Mauj&#8217; (Baiju Bawra). Hits from the 1940s such as &#8216;Jiya Bekarar Hair&#8217; (Barsaat), &#8216;Do Naina Tumhare Pyare&#8217; (Shrimatiji) and &#8216;Yeh Zindagi Usiki Hai&#8217; (Anarkali) fearure in Vol-3 while Vol-4 has Top 8 song clips of the first ever Geetmala Hit Parade. For Vol-5, Sayani chooses the hits and misses of 1955 such as &#8216;Kitna Haseen Hai Mausam&#8217; (Azad) and &#8216;Thandi Hawa Kali Ghata&#8217; (Mr. &amp; Mrs. 55). For Vols 6-10, Sayani narrows down the choice to hits from the period 1956-58&#8230; such as &#8216;Kise Yaad Rakhoon&#8217; (Anurag), &#8220;Pinjre ke Panchi&#8217; (Nagmani), &#8216;O Neend Na Mujko Aaye&#8217; (Post Box 999) and &#8216;O Gadiwali&#8217; (Mother India).What makes this collection unique is the snatches of interviews with legends including Raj Kapoor (he talks about Nargis), Kishore Kumar, Asha Bhonsle, Jagdeep and Mehmood. What&#8217;s more, one can listen to the celebrity voices of B.R. Chopra, C. Ramachandra, Suraiya, Anil Biswas, Sohrab Modi, Begum Akhtar, Meena Kumari, Sunil Dutt, Amitabh Bachchan and many more.The Sayani brand of humour is still in tact as is evident in his narration, which is peppered with shayiri and anecdotes. And yes, the Hit Parade list is there for all to listen to once more. This presentation of &#8216;the radio dost&#8217; Sayani is a priceless possession for Hindi film song buffs!
