VRaga Jhari, one of the leading cultural organisations run by women, reappeared after a long gap with a big programme last week at Thyagaraya Gana Sabha. Devotional songs penned by budding poetess Bharati Rangarajan were presented on the occasion. Her compositions on goddess Durga were combined with semi-classical numbers from films of great music composers like Ilayaraja.The singers on the stage included child prodigy Sindhuja, who eventually became major attraction, along with another singer Sudharani. The latter is a Carnatic musician and MA gold medallist in music. Male singers Habeeb and Krishna also rendered some popular duets with female singers. The repertoire was a combination of semi-classical songs, some private and some from films.After Sindhuja opened the show with Bharati's song on goddess Durga, Sudharani also joined the rendition.Ganapthi stotramand a composition on Lord Venkateswara by Sudharani put the show on positive note. Nearly two dozen compositions were rendered by these four singers. Some songs rendered by Krishna, however, were outside the Shruthi conformity.Om Namah Sivayaby Sudharani and a Tamil song by Sindhuja were the greater draw in the first part of the program.Sivani Bhavaniby Sindhuja,Yamuna Teeram, and a duet by Sudha and Habib in the earlier part was applauded.Mrogindi Veena,Sri Gowriand some more semi-classical renditions went to Sindhuja's lot, who sang them with perfection.The film songs were sung by Habib, Krishna and Sudharani with a classical touch. The 10-piece orchestra adapted well to the situations supporting with the right kind of instruments from classical to light and folk.G.S.Bottom Template Starts
