VS.P.Sikkil C. GurucharanCarnatic classical vocal &#8211; Rs. 125Compositions of Ashok Madhav have been sung in this audio CD by Sikkil C. Gurucharan. The harbinger for the programme is a varnam on Devi Saraswathi in Gambheeranattai set to Adi talam sung with commendable attention to the raga&#8217;s anuswarams.&#8216;Vandeham&#8217; in Shanmukhapriya invoking the Lord of auspiciousness couched in pleasant Sanskrit lyrics and a string of fluent, uncomplicated sarvalagu swara chains set the appropriate tone and tenor. Hamsakalyani, a janya of Kalyani, attires the song melodiously and the artiste sings it with ease lucidly covering the various sthayis. &#8216;Bhajamyaham&#8217; is the kriti that spells an imaginative mind. Abheri, or if you prefer, Karnataka Deva Gandhari by the vocalist and the violinist, S. Varadarajan, who has made his presence felt in the Carnatic music spectrum, has many enjoyable musical moments.Again the kalpanaswaras articulated without taxing the rasika with mind-boggling calculations, yet creating a vivacious atmosphere are skilfully woven. The kriti, &#8216;Jagelara&#8217; is bound to receive a warm rasika response. &#8216;Gopala Balam&#8217; in Kannada and the Bhavapriya kriti, &#8216;Bhuvaneswari&#8217; register high on a Richter scale of mellifluent music.Gurucharan has a talent for simple communication, hardly ever overburdening the raga alapana with superfluous prayogas and this trait makes for wider listening. His Khamboji development, the song, &#8216;Pahi Jagat&#8217; and the swara improvisations confirm this observation.Guruvayur Dorai, a veteran mridangist who is regarded with high esteem in the musical community and S.V.Ramani also an experienced ghatam player sensivity provide percussion support and play a well-conceived thani avartanam. The lighter genre of music is just Gurucharan&#8217;s cup of tea &#8212; the songs in Bagesri and Behag and the final one in Surutti beckons the ear in positive fashion.Bottom Template Starts
