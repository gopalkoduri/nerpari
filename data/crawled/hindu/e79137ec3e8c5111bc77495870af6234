VThe main piece was Charukesi, a &#8216;wow-able&#8217; selection because the raga is becoming rare in concert halls.The alapana that Ganesh played dazzled with gliding gamakas and was  superb.  Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Adamodikalade&#8217; was taken up and played well. Then came the swaras at the pallavi line, which broke into a ragamalika mode, traversing through a dozen ragas, one tala cycle each. So far so good! Then came the high speeds &#8212; eight notes to a beat.Manodharma music was replaced by formatted swaras, delivered in alternately thin and loud volumes and accompanied by cacophonous thumping on the tavil (Haridwaramangalam A.K.Palanivel) and mridangam (Bangalore Praveen). While the show brought out the brothers&#8217; amazing talent, music had given  way to madness, Charukesi abandoned  by the wayside.The Hamsanadam alapana that took off with a speedy brigha was brilliant &#8212; worth the violins&#8217; weight in gold. But when the violinists took up Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Banturithi&#8217; in such a hurried gait, it was evident that their focus was on talent-display rather than aesthetics. For a composition, which brims with humility (Tyagaraja pleads with Rama to give him the job of a guard so that he could be with Him all the time), the play was, in contrast with the alapana, un-aesthetic.The duo seems to follow a certain pattern of taper in their swaras. For example, in Hamsanadham they played &#8216;ma-pa-ni-sa, pa-ni-sa, ni-sa, sa&#8217; with the last note delivered with a flourish and a flashy swing of the bow. Fine. But to do that in each component of the concert is a bit taxing.The other principal elements of the concert were &#8216;Rama Bhakti Samrajyam&#8217; (Suddha Bangala, Tyagaraja) and &#8216;Senthil Andavan&#8217; (Kharaharapriya, Papanasam Sivan) and &#8216;Muruga Muruga&#8217; (Saveri, Periasami Thooran).Kumaresh&#8217;s alapana of Kharaharapriya was delectable. The tani turned out to be a true sawal-jawab with Palanivel playing a single cycle set of beats and Praveen playing it back. Praveen did a swell job of measuring up to the tavil maestro.Palanivel played innumerable patterns of beats, which were amazing but the tani seemed to go  on and on.
