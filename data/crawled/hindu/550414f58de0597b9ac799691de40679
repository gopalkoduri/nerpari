VMusee Musical presented a delightful concert titled &#8216;A Journey Across Europe' at St. Christopher's College of Education, recently, featuring flautist Michelle Lee and pianist Lindsey Butterfield. Internationally acclaimed performers, the artists are currently on a visit to Chennai as examiners at the Trinity Guildhall (formerly Trinity College, London).At the concert, the first piece they played was a four-movement Sonata no.4 in A minor for flute and piano by George Frederic Handel. The artists' choice of music with embellishments for the flute, served to lace the notes of the slow movements exquisitely. The tuneful piece was played with subtlety and feeling. This was followed by &#8216;Romance' by the 20th century Norwegian Johan Kvandal which was a lilting melody. Butterfield was a sympathetic accompanist.Next, Butterfield took the stage as soloist playing Allegro De Concerto by the Spanish composer Enrique Granados, a demanding work which was executed with verve and brilliance. Lee and Butterfield got together again to perform Robert Schumann's &#8216;Three Romances.' The pieces, rendered in a singing style, brought out the romantic mode that Schumann championed.Fine techniqueAfter the &#8216;Ballade' by Carl Reinecke, a German composer, Lee was in her element as she played the unaccompanied &#8216;Sky Dance' by Geoffrey Winters, one of a diverse list of composers of various nationalities that Lee has commissioned to write for her. Written in a decidedly modern idiom, the piece brought out Lee's fine technique and musicality. The programme ended with a sonata for flute and piano by the 20th century French composer Francis Poulenc. The Allegro was followed by a lovely Cantilena, and the Presto giocoso scintillatingly performed, left the audience applauding till the duo came back for an encore. They then played a John Rutter, the piano also seemed to sing with the flute in Rutter's inimitable, simple yet engaging style -- a fitting end to the journey across Europe with Michelle Lee and Lindsey Buttterfield.There was something special about this concert -- the number of youngsters present Many were students of music; their enthusiasm was obvious; there was no better way to give them an idea of musical excellence they could aspire to. Indeed, it was an admirable way to serve the Western music community in Chennai.
