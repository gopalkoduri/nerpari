VThe keys on the Keyboard are hard and separate, its quite a feat accomplished and an experience to introduce innovation on the board. Beginning with Raga Poorya of the Marwa That, the notes being the same, Adhithi set it apart from Marwa by delineating with varying emphasis the vadi and samvadi of each raga and further differentiated it from Poorya by showing the primeval position of komal re in Marwa. While the movement in the two ragas is in the madhya and mandre saptaks, she cited example of Sohni, a raga with the same notes but with characteristic movement in the Uttranga. Adhithi began with extensive Alap, followed it with gat in Madhya laya teen taal and finally laced it with Jor and Jhala, characteristic of the Sitar, learning the technique from none other than the Sitar Maestro Pt. Janardhan, a follower of Maihari tradition.The dhrut laya piece in teen taal showed great moments of repartee and exchange between Jain and Adhithi and provided many exhilarating moments. This sandhiprakash Raga which witnessed the confluence of night and day was followed by a piece in Hamsadhwani, spanning the three octaves with its majestic pause on &#8216;pa&#8217; and &#8216;sa&#8217; being its vadi and samvadi and its characteristic halt on &#8216;re.&#8217; Here too she stuck to the traditional mode of presentation of alap, gat jor and jhala. The phrases like &#8216;ga pa ni sa-ga re sa nee pa&#8217; in the higher octave were touched beautifully while arriving at the refrain &#8216;ga re ni re sa, ni re sa&#8217; in the lower octave.The next raga, Sallapam, a carnatic raga, executed in Hindusthani style soothing and melodic is a bit of a variation of Malkauns. Everything remaining the same, the komal ghandhar is replaced by tivr gandhar.For Ragamalika Adhithi took the Asthai of Gandhiji&#8217;s favourite bhajan &#8216;Vaishnav Janato&#8217; in Khamaj and dressed it in ragas such as  Bhoop,Yaman, Des, Brindabani Sarang, Megh Miya ki malhar, Kalavati Ahir, Bhairav, Malayamarutham, a Carnatic raga and Sindhubhairavi, delighting in the distinct mood of each raga.Adhithi&#8217;s concert in short gave a new dimension, a creative dimension to the otherwise popular instrument which enhances any concert with its tonal quality.Adhithi&#8217;s thunderous strokes at lightening speed produced broad reverberating sounds, sometimes reminiscent of the Santoor, sometimes of the Jal-Tarang and sometimes of the Sitar. Her recital is a departure from the conventional practice and has led to a growing appreciation of the instrument and to the evolution of a style, an indefinable musical ethos born out of a common heritage of musical experience and exposure to technical advancement; giving her creative work its flavour and language.Jain Painadathe on the Tabla with his intricate layakari, execution of rela, chakradhar and small qaida made the concert, which was held at the Narada Ghana Sabha recently, a memorable experience.
