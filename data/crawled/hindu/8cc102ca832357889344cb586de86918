VThe second, though apparently was  Kharaharapriya sans the madhyamam, took on an entirely different and recognisable contour (pokku), made abundantly evident by the brilliantly handled raga delineation and song elaboration.What really struck you was the strength, stability and the pleasurable momentum of the notes as also the conscious sharing of alapanas and niraval &#8212; done with a degree of flexibility and panache.The swara exercises had many formal phrases that pulsed with life &#8212; especially the exhaustive sequences and kuraippus for Gowri Manohari and Madhyamaravali. The Saramati song (&#8216;ArulaVendum&#8217; - Desikar) also had an  alapana stretched  by Kannan, the elder. &#8216;Samayamithira&#8217; (Saraswathi Manohari &#8211; Syama Sastri) was taken up next and interestingly enough, the second speed was rendered with admirable comfort.Gowri Manohari was presented with myriad prayogas &#8212; with  depth and imagination.The discerning eye observed that the elder held the instrument from left to right, and the younger from right to left. In hindsight, one felt that if Gowri Manohari was already on the agenda as the main item, Hamsa Deepkam, which is only a slight variant could have been reserved for another concert.&#8216;Jaya Jaya Swamin&#8217; (Nattai - Tirtha), &#8216;Baro Krishnaiah,&#8217; (with all its piercing brigas - a la MLV) and a tillana were also included. Thanjavur Govindarajan, (special) and Veliyambakkam Ganapathi who were on the thavil were in complete harness with each other and settled into a rhythm of watching and waiting while playing for the songs. Their thani was phrase-rich with layering and gathering of sollus that had  varied combinations  visible in the smallest detail. It mainly swivelled on two-avarthanam combinations with many tapering and widening solkattus and odhukkals, which exploited in many ways the kutchi side of the thavil with powerful effect.The stage was full of champions &#8212; Kadri Gopalnath (saxophone), Kanyakumari (violin), Haridwaramangalam  Palanivel (thavil), Amrit (kanjira) and Bangalore Rajasekhar (morsing) &#8212; and the concert itself established and underlined the cardinal rule that if each artiste could play their modular role to perfection without needless overpowering, the concert could be raised and maintained to its attainable aesthetic level. The raga designs for Revathi (Ragam-Thanam-Pallavi) and Dwijavanthi (&#8216;Akhilandeswari&#8217; - Dikshitar) by Kadri had intermittent phrases characterised by soft and controlled blowing with revealing and communicating cadences with customary quickstep brigas and curls this instrument is prone to. Kadri&#8217;s ripening acquaintance with music was already on play during the alapana of Jayanthasri (&#8216;Marukelara&#8217; - Tyagaraja) and during the kriti playing.&#8216;Samanmevaru&#8217; (Karaharapriya - Tyagaraja) was again rendered in its sublime form as an exclusive kriti. Kanyakumari on the violin provided solid support sustaining her levels of individual initiative. The glowing glide tinged with melodic purity that sourced at &#8216;Guruguha&#8217; (&#8216;Akhilandeswari&#8217;) still lingers in one&#8217;s ears.The niraval and swaraprastara saw the high level of vidwat &#8212; born out of years of experience &#8212; that combined well with deft control and command that the artistes possessed.The final phase was understandably a response session and audience requests &#8212; &#8216;Kurai Ondrum Illai,&#8217; &#8216;Krisha Nee Begane,&#8217; &#8216;Vaishnava Janatho&#8217; and &#8216;Brahmam Okate&#8217; were rendered in fine order. The litany of sangatis for &#8216;Bhagyada Lakshmi&#8217; was,  however, redundant  and could have been avoided.Kadri was seen in two juxtaposed roles &#8212; one as an instrumentalist where the inevitable stress was on vadhya-virtuosity and the other a more transcending role where there was an acquired reticence directing him and the listener towards divinity.The thani saw the laya vidwans give free rein to experiment with new feisty techniques all done with a shared understanding. Palanivel sourced many well-thought-out phrases that were answered with verve by Amrit and Rajasekhar playing in tandem.The special rounds had sollus and their rearrangements at the beginning, middle and end of an avartanam with critically timed karvais and many accurate quartering exercises executed during the kuraippu with unending varieties.Palanivel&#8217;s gentle unintrusive following during the songs really belied his magnificent abilities as he took the lead during the thani providing it with multifarious strands of laya patterns.
