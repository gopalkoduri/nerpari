VJAYARAMAN VRafique Khan, son of Ustad Abdul Karim Khan, presented a sitar recital at Hotel Abad Auditorium in Kochi. He is the grandson of  Ustad Rahimat Khan, who added the base `octave' to the instrument. The concert, held under the auspices of ISCRA and Suddha Kalyan, had Rafique starting with an alaap in Pooria Dhanasree, of Poorvi Thaat. More of the contemplative kind of musician rather than the theatrical one, his phrasing during the delineation of the raga had a mix of thethanthrakari(instrumental) andgayaki.Jod-Jhala (similar to Thaanam) followed. Filled with improvisations, the implementation of a variety of `Meendu' was warmly welcomed by the audience.Rhythm and melodyGath, (a sequel to Pallavi), in `theen' thaal was set to slow and fast sequences in which the raga edifice was conjoined harmoniously with rhythm and melody, a speciality of Gwalior gharana. Jinjoti (Chenchurutty) was captivating with the innovations in lower and middle registers.A bandishin `roopak' (slow tempo) and a fast one in `theenthal' came next. A brief `sawal-jawab' with Rajendra Nakode on the tabla enlivened the programme. It was followed by ragas such as Kiravani, Peelu and Hemavathi. It was supplemented by a bandish in Misra Piloo set to Khaherva.  Khan ended the recital with a Dhun in Misra Pahadi. Rajendra Nakode, following Dilli-Purab `gharana,' with his clear-cut Tekhas, super fast Parans, Tehais (theerumaanam played in three identical sequence) and varied bass tonal shades on the left drum, mesmerised the audience.Bottom Template Starts
