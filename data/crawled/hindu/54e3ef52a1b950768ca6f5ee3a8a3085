VA new organisation, the Delhi Muththamizh Peravai, was formed in the Capital with a bang and recently organised a festival at the Delhi Tamil Sangam. The second day of the three-day event  featured Parasuram Sriram and Anuradha Sriram  in a jugalbandi programme, in which the couple presented pairs of Carnatic and Hindustani ragas resembling or close to each other.Though the two singers did a commendable job within the format they had designed, sadly, it did not quite add up to a wholesome concert experience. The tani avartanam (percussion solo) of the percussionists was, however, captivating.  Anuradha and Parasuram both handled both the forms of music, and in the Carnatic session even introduced improvisation techniques like raga alapana and swaraprastaras.Viju Sivanand on the violin and M.V. Chandrasekhar on the mridangam provided good support during the couple&#8217;s Carnatic portion, while Rashid Mustafa on the table and Vinay Mishra on the harmonium accompanied the Hindustani session.It was delightful to see the Hindustani music accompanists listening with rapt attention and enjoying themselves as their Carnatic counterparts performed. The reciprocal situation too was in evidence.A Tamil play and a light music programmes were the other programmes during  the festival.  It is heartening to see a new  cultural organisation come up in the Capital, and it is hoped it  comes out with frequent programmes over a long period of time.In another concert organised by Shri Venkateswara Fine Arts Trust, Neyveli R. Santhanagopalan delighted rasikas during his vocal recital of about two hours. After the opening Sahana varnam in  Adi tala, Santhanagopalan presented Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Mahaganapatim&#8221; in raga Nattai. The swaraprastaras towards the end were brief but lively.Two compositions, one of Periasami Thuran, &#8220;Muruga Muruga&#8221; in raga Saveri, and another of Dikshitar, &#8220;Kamalambam bhajare&#8221; in raga Kalyani, underwent detailed presentation. He brought the melodies of these ragas to the fore by delineating them in stages.Further improvisations for the former composition were in the form of a neraval of the pallavi itself and creative swara formats. For the latter composition, it was the swara formats built on formidable &#8216;laya arithmetic&#8217;.In a seemingly half-hearted approach with limited time at his disposal, Santhanagopalan presented a ragam-taanam-pallavi. The pallavi &#8220;Vennai thinna china tharamma hare Krishna&#8221; in raga Suruti was set to Tisra Jaati Triputa tala. The raga alapana as well as the taanam were delightful, though brief. The ragamalika swaraprastaras in ragas Suruti, Sindhu Bhairavi, Amritavarshini, Bilahiri and Ahiri, were delightful when he sang them in this order, but not when he went through them in the reverse order, before culminating with a &#8216;korvai&#8217; (ending pattern).V. Sanjeev gave excellent support on the violin, which included the delightful delineation of ragas Saveri and Kalyani. The percussion support provided by Delhi&#8217;s Kartik Narayanan on the mridangam and K. Ramamurthy on the ghatam was however, lacklustre.VENKATESAN SRIKANTH
