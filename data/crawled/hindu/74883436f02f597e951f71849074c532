VThe people of Visakhapatnam were treated to Carnatic vocal and violin concert as part of the six day festival conducted by Visakha Music Academy at Kalabharathi celebrating its 41 {+s} {+t} anniversary. The wisdom with which the working committee of the Academy, especially its secretary M.S. Srinivas planned the entire programme including a lecture and demonstration on Sunday morning turned out to be a sumptuous treat of Carnatic music.Inaugurated by the octogenarian Sangeetha Kalanidhi Nedunuri Krishna Murty, it started with a presentation of the puraskar instituted in his name to noted vocalist N. Vijay Siva of Chennai. Later, Siva in the company of R.K. Shriram Kumar on violin, N. Manoj Siva on mridangam (from Chennai) and P. Haribabu from Guntur on ghatam, kept the houseful audience thrilled with his eruditely rendered recital for about three hours. His virtuosic manodharma in the form of copiously rendered raga-alapanas and swaram besides neravu in select items felicitously traversing little over two and half octaves with the same intensity and with artful articulation of appropriate gamaka was a special attraction and almost like his guru D.K. Jayaraman. The highlights were the expansive expatiation of Tyagaraja's Raksha Pettare in Bhairavi and RTP in Khamas with the pallavi rendered in Misrachapu besides a slokam in ragamalika made up of Kedaram, Nayaki, Sri, Keeravani, Latangi, Sama, Jaganmohini and Charukesi.The second evening started with a function conferring the Academy's title Sangeeta Kalasagara on the virtuosic violinist A. Kanyakumari before her violin solo with her disciple Sanjeev providing support on another violin, K.V. Prasad on mridangam and K.V. Gopalakrishnan on kanjira. It went almost like the concert on the previous day. The highlights were the expansive expatiation of Chakkani Rajamaargamu (Kharaharapriya) of Tyagaraja and ragamalika in Revathi, Sriranjani, Valaji, Lalita, Mohana, Hindolam and Bahudari, all rendered in three tempos very skilfully.
