VN. Ramani&#8217;s flute recital under the aegis of Dhanvanthari Kalakshetra was pregnant with bhava and a melodious mix of alapana and racy musical phrasings in swaras. His aesthetic approach in the elaboration of ragas was evident from the beginning.Commencing the Swagatham Krishna concert in flute, with Valachi varnam in ragamalika in two speeds, Ramani warmed up to present &#8216;Sree Maha Ganapathi&#8217; in Gowlai that promised a mellifluous fare for the rest of the session.The Hindolam alapana had proper balance and proportion for the kriti, &#8216;Saama Gaana Lola&#8217;. Kalyani was elaborated with &#233;lan taking the audience to a meditative mood and the song, &#8216;Vasudevayani&#8217; was an alluring version.The raga vinyasam of Thodi, the highlight of the concert woven by prayogas rich in texture and content, came one after another unhurriedly sans gimmicks.&#8216;Enna Thavam&#8217;  (Kapi) and &#8216;Theeradha Vilayattuppillai&#8217; were time-fillers.A lilting Dhanasri tillana closed his musical agenda. K. Balasubramaniam was the violin accompanist.The percussive skills of Prakash (mridangam) and Suresh (ghatam) gave an added impetus to the proceedings.
