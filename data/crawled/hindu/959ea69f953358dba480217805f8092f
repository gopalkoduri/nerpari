VMusic I Like: Delightful interpretations of Great WorksVirgin Records ( India ) P Ltd.Karthik (Carnatic)Audio CDPrice Rs. 195.This compact disc has been brought out as a result of the lingering impact made by certain very popular songs in the Carnatic repertoire. Vocalist Karthik, who has come under the spell of these compositions, is perhaps more comfortable as a light music singer. The aim of this disc, probably is, to take classical Carnatic music to the uninitiated. The orchestration between the segments of the compositions is attractive. The use of Western instruments such as the guitar, drums and saxophone adds novelty to the fare.Karthik is endowed with a pleasing crooner's voice and his vocalisation engages one's attention.The songs figuring in this recording are &#8216;Mahaganapathim' (Nattai), &#8216;Krishna Nee Begane' (Yamunakalyani ), &#8216;Brochevarevarura' (Kamas), &#8216;Pibare Rama Rasam' (Ahir Bhairav), &#8216;Nagumomu' (Abheri with Chatusruthi daivatham ), &#8216;Naanati Brathuku' (Revati) and a mangalam composed by Bhadrachalam Ramadasar. Snatches from Subramania Bharathiyar's compositions such as &#8216;Manathil Urudi Vendum,' &#8216;Suttum Vizhi Sudar' and &#8216;Nallador Veenai' are also offered by the vocalist.The credit for the orchestration as per the inlay card goes to Sai Madhurkar. This compact disc will go well with listeners who have an ear for not too heavy a Carnatic fare.
