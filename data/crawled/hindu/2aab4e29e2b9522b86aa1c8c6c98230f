VSankaran Namboothiri was at his best in a concert arranged by Navaneetha Gopalakrishna Swamy temple in Ambikapuram. With subtle modulations in his sonorous voice and a judicious selection of songs, he held the large audience in rapt attention. His ke\u000aen sense of &#8216;bhava&#8217; and clear diction were the other contributory factors for the success of the concert.He maintained a fine tempo right from the opening piece &#8216;Gajavadana Beduve&#8217; in Hamsadhwani (Purandaradaasa) till the last item &#8211; his mentor T.V.Gopalakrishnan&#8217;s tillana in Kadanakuthoohalam.He aptly chose a good number of songs on Krishna, the presiding deity of the temple. &#8216;Guruvayurappa&#8217; in Chakravaaham (Papanasam Sivan) and &#8216;Gaanamurthe&#8217; in Gaanamurthi (Tyagaraja) set the mood for the kritis that followed. Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Govardhana gireesam smaraami&#8217; in Hindolam, with an enchanting chittaswaram, won spontaneous acclaim.Sankaran&#8217;s musical acumen was amply demonstrated in his alapanas of Kalyani and Mohanam. Laying due emphasis on the jeeva swaras, he painted a panoramic picture of the two melodies, punctuated with pleasing &#8216;gamakas&#8217; and &#8216;akaaras.&#8217; The imaginative neraval and swaraprasthaaras at &#8216;Brindavanantha kritha&#8217; in the kriti &#8216;Pankaja Lochana&#8217; (Swati Tirunal) made a good impact.While elaborating Mohanam, he effortlessly moved in the &#8216;thaara sthayi,&#8217; touching the &#8216;panchamam.&#8217; His interpretation of Tyagaraja&#8217;s famous kriti &#8216;Mohana Raama&#8217; captured its intrinsic beauty. The innovative kalpana swaras lent further charm.Popular kritis such as  &#8216;Idathu paadham thookki&#8217; in Kamas, &#8216;Srivalli Devasenapathe&#8217; in Natabhairavi, &#8216;Adaathu asangadhu vaa Kanna&#8217; in Madhyamavathi  and &#8216;Kakkaichiraginile&#8217; in Brindavanasaaranga rendered with feeling, were applauded. Purandaradasa&#8217;s &#8216;Nandatanaya&#8217; in Pimplas and Annamacharya &#8216;Narayanathe Namo Namo&#8217; in Dhesh were rich in devotional fervour. Sankaran also sang a rare Swati Tirunal kriti &#8216;Smarasipuraguruvanitha&#8217; in Anandabhairavi and a Malayalam composition &#8216;Aakasamam pulli&#8217; in Karaharapriya, in praise of Ayyappa.Violinist Viju S. Anand impressed the listeners with his superb raga delineations and kalpana swaras. Balakrishna Kamath displayed maturity in his mridangam accompaniment.He was ably supported by Manjoor Unnikrishnan on the ghatam. Their tani avarthanam was enjoyable.
