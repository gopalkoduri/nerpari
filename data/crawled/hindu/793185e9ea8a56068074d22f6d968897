VAmrutha Sankaranarayanan is bestowed with a heavy metallic voice which has dominant effect that differentiates her singing from the rest of her  peers.So when she started her vocal recital with the viruttam in Shanmukhapriya, &#8216;Sudaroliye Potri&#8217; in high pitch as a prelude to the kriti &#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam&#8217; at the Nungambakkam Cultural Academy, the hall resonated with her booming voice.Amrutha exuded extraordinary poise in her offerings. The swara passage that followed &#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam&#8217; had spirit.The Atana kriti &#8216;Yaar Undanaipol Adarippavar&#8217; added further buzz to her presentation.  The Khambodi essay was loaded with sancharas traversing mostly in the tara sthayi. Amrutha&#8217;s voice has the potential to cruise sancharas and swaras in the upper registers.Concentration only on the strident expression can create awe but not appreciation. Amrutha should hone and tone down her unique vocal chords to keep them under control and unleash them only when needed.Otherwise her efforts in open mouth articulation will end up as boisterous demonstration.&#8216;Maa Janaki&#8217; of Tyagaraja was her selection with a flamboyant niraval, swaras included in the anupallavi &#8216;Raja Raja Vara Rajeevaksha.&#8217; The swaras flashed with the popular refrain of Khambodi, &#8216;ga ma pa ma ga ri ga sa ri ga&#8217; apart from numerous interesting combinations.Kapi ragam always offers ample scope for an imaginative singer to interpret its interesting imageries.Amrutha exploited her creative ability to build up Kapi in a powerful manner with &#8216;Inta Sowkya&#8217; once again of Tyagaraja,  but only the &#8216;sowkyam&#8217; (respite) was missing to some extent.Amrutha  has commendably inherited the musical grandiosity from her father.  Nevertheless, there is always a difference; an undercurrent of soft feminine touch to the music will definitely be needed to add value to Amrutha&#8217;s vocal ability.Shertalai Sivakumar on the violin reassured Amrutha&#8217;s raga expositions and swara segments with similar flair and substance.His contribution in Khambodi and Kapi carried softer sections to neutralise Amrutha&#8217;s power play.Neyveli Ramkumar on the mridangam kept his cool without resorting to higher decibels to match the sound presentation of the main artist.
