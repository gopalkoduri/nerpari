VGARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMHe is gifted with a natural instinct for self-expression; and his style of delivery, ever so unobtrusive, marks out Dr. Shankar Srinivas, the U.S-based young vocalist among the many Non-Resident Indian performers to whom music is perhaps at best a nostalgic pursuit. He performed for Nada Inbam recently.The doctor's sense of spontaneity might not have been too noticeable in the opening varnam set in Abogi, or even in the kalpanaswara that he sang thereafter. But then, that was the beauty of his approach to singing, wherein the melody was always unmistakable but the emotive content not overly pronounced.Srinivas is not unduly troubled when you tell him that the first alapana in the concert came as late as in the fifth piece &#151;  as a prelude to the Dikshitar kriti in Hemavati &#151;  or that he sang kalpanaswara in succession in the first four compositions. Such details are not particularly significant, you may surmise from his reaction.Musical richnessBut significant from the point of view of the listener was that the swaras were not excessive.Nor were `Kanugonu Sowkhyamu,' `Ksheerasagara Sayee ' and `Agasteesvaram Aradaye' in any way wanting in terms of musical richness without the other embellishment.Tyagaraja's `Emi Anati Ichchitivo,' (Sahana) and `Yenduku peddalavale,' the major composition of the evening (Sankarabharanam) were highly absorbing renditions.V.V.Ravi, who accompanied Srinivas on the violin, was exceptional in the expositions of Hemavati and Sankarabharanam.K.V.Prasad, the lone percussionist on the mridangam, was equally competent.Bottom Template Starts
