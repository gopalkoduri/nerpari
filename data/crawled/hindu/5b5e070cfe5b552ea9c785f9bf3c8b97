VHamsini Nagendra, accompanied by R. Dayakar (violin), K.U. Jayachandra Rao (mridanga), and Bhagyalakshmi M. Krishna (morsing), presented a vocal recital at the MES Kalavedi, Bangalore, last week.The concert began with &#8220;Intha Chalamu&#8221;, the adi tala varna in Begada, which was followed by Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar's &#8220;Sri Mahaganapathim Bhajeham&#8221; in Athana raga and adi tala. &#8220;Darini Telusukonti&#8221;, the Thyagaraja composition in Shuddha Saveri, rendered with great fidelity to its imposing musical structure, was one of the most impressive items of the concert, with the charana line beginning &#8220;Rajitha Manigana Bhushani&#8221; incorporating a profusion of intricate sangathis. The interpretation of &#8220;Narayana&#8221; in Shuddha Dhanyasi raga and khanda chapu thala was permeated with devotional fervour, further enhancing the exquisite beauty of the composition and the lilting shades of the raga enshrined in it.Purvikalyani was next taken up for a detailed alapana, beginning with a few mellow, meditative and bhava-enriched sancharas, and progressing to a torrent of bhriga-oriented sancharas. A pronounced bias towards the tara sthayi was evident throughout the concert, and was especially notable in the current raga elaboration, clearly highlighting the shadja, rishabha, gandhara and panchama in sequence.The Shyama Shastri krithi &#8220;Ninnu Vina&#8221; featured a chiselled neraval and copious kalpana swaras in two speeds ending with a stint at the thara sthayi shadja, augmented by competent support from the accompanying artistes and culminating in a compact tani avartana. The concluding part of the concert included Kavikunjara Bharathi's &#8220;Ivanaro&#8221; in Kamboji and Purandaradasa's &#8220;Narajanma Bandaga&#8221; in Madhuvanthi and a ragamalika sloka.Hamsadhwani Creations celebrated its tenth anniversary recently, with a series of programmes at the Bangalore Gayana Samaja. The festival drew to a close with a thematic concert titled &#8220;Guruvandana&#8221; comprising compositions paying obeisance to, and extolling the role of, the guru, by Dr. R.K.Srikantan and M.S. Sheela, accompanied by Charulatha Ramanujam (violin), H.S. Sudhindra (mridanga) and Giridhar Udupa (ghata).The artistes, led by maestro R.K.Srikantan, presented an enthralling rendition of some of the compositions included in the CD &#8220;Guruvandana&#8221; released recently by Hamsadhwani Creations. Commencing with the sloka &#8220;Vasudevasutham Devam&#8221; in Todi, the concept of Lord Krishna as the Universal Preceptor was extended to the Dikshitar krithi in the same raga set to adi tala, &#8220;Srikrishnam Bhaja Manasa Sathatham&#8221;, which followed. While Mahavaidyanatha Iyer's composition &#8220;Sri Sankara Guruvaram&#8221; set to Nagaswaravali raga and rupaka tala, adorned with kalpana swaras, provided a mellifluous contrast to the sedate grandeur of the previous composition, Mysore Vasudevacharya's &#8220;Sri Purandara Guruvaram&#8221; in Saraswathi Manohari raga and misra jathi triputa tala, prefaced the ensuing main item of the brief recital.A succinct elaboration of Shankarabharana, which confined itself mainly to the madhya sthayi, preceded &#8220;Gurucharanam Bhajare&#8221; in adi tala, a majestic composition by Valajabet Venkataramana Bhagavathar. The presentation of the krithi, the kalpana swaras affixed to it and the short tani avarthana that followed were indicative of its inherent scope for further amplification into a major concert ensemble. The final piece of the performance was the ragamalika &#8220;Sri Shyamashastri Charitam&#8221; in adi tala, another composition of Mysore Vasudevacharya.
