VA strong tone and clear enunciation worked to Rajini Hariharan's advantage in her vocal recital for the Nungambakkam Cultural Academy Trust's Sri Rama Navami music festival.The thrust of her concert centred around two ragas -- Sriranjini and Mohanam. &#8216;Rama Ninnuvina' (Sankarabharanam) with shadja-varja sangatis in the pallavi made for an interesting choice of kriti in the initial segment, embossing a decidedly classical stamp. Niraval was detailed and unhurried in two speeds and free flowing kalpanaswaras were capped with a neat korvai.It was a placid, unexceptionable Sriranjini that preceded Tyagaraja's &#8216;Brochevaarevare,' the alapana carrying punch and puissance in the tara sthayi shadja-centric sancharas and higher reaches. The madhyama kala sprightliness of swara forays culminated in a kuraippu at the dhaivata. The niraval in &#8216;Bantureethi' (Hamsanadam, Tyagaraja) was a concerted attempt, but lacked finesse.&#8216;Rama Nama Payasake' (Anandabhairavi, Purandaradasa) provided a foil for the main raga Mohanam, which asserted itself with characteristic verve and positive energy. The vocalist frequently took recourse to the device of symmetrical motifs to evoke form.The Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Mohana Rama' exuded evergreen appeal. Other items included &#8216;Jaya Jaya' (Nattai) and &#8216;Ramachandram Bhavayami' (Vasantha, Muthuswami Dikshithar).While the artist's voice traversed octaves with ease, occasional lapses in sruti alignment and inconsistent kala pramana that manifested during kriti and swara rendition marred the otherwise smooth flow. Tonal modulation would have gone a long away in creating vallinam-mellinam. Violinist Padma Shankar's neat raga expositions, Thiruvidaimarudur Shankaran's sturdy, reliable support (mridangam) and G.Ravichandran's (ghatam) focus on stabilising kalapramana bolstered the vocalist's efforts.Sincere attemptAfter a minor spell of starting trouble in the Kanada Ata tala varnam &#8216;&#732;Neranammithi' in which both sruti and kalapramana faltered, Bhooma Kasturi strove for a steady gait and an air of tranquillity in Tyagaraja's &#8216;Meru Samana' (Mayamalavagowla).Her vocal concert was organised as part of the Nungambakkam Cultural Academy Trust's Sri Rama Navami series.A sketch of Hamsadhwani was followed by &#8216;Anjile Onru Petran' a sloka on Anjaneya and the kriti &#8216;Thunai Vandarul Purivaan.' &#8216;Dhanyu devvado' (Malayamarutham, Patnam Subramania Iyer) was presented as a filler before an earnest attempt to portray Sriranjini which paid off in those segments strengthened by pidis.The viruttam &#8216;Ramaaya Ramabhadraya' and the composition &#8216;Sri Ramachandro Rakshatu Maam' placed the artist in a comfort zone, with the pallavi line taken up for niraval and kalpanaswara in simple patterns.It was commendable that the artist made it a point to present the items with vim and vigour and incorporate viruttam as a preface to the kriti after alapana, unfazed by the thin attendance. While sahitya spashtam was a plus, the vocalist needs to work on voice and tonal control, evenness of kalapramana and fine tuning manodharma aspects, particularly alapana.The violinist Gokulakrishnan's efforts were competent, while K. Parthasarathy's percussive talent (mridangam) made you sit up and pay attention. His playing had a compelling energy, firm strokes generating smooth trails and cross currents in the misra chapu thani.
