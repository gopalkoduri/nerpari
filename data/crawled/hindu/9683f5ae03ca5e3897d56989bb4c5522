VA three-day festival of dance and music dedicated to Swati Tirunal was held at Sree Koodalmanickam temple in Irinjalakkuda.The concert on the first day was by Sreyas Narayanan. He was accompanied by Nellai Ravindran (violin), Melattur Balasubramanian (mridangam) and Thrikkakara Y.N. Santharam (ganjira).A disciple of P.S. Narayanaswamy, Sreyas maintained the purity and perfection of the tradition he belongs to and sang each kriti in a tempo that best suited the piece, thereby enhancing the beauty of the whole recital. The swara passages he sang for the opening piece &#8216;Devadevakalayamithe' in Maayamaalavagowla were reminiscent of the Semmangudi bani. The grandeur of Atana was revealed in the kriti &#8216;Sree Kumara Nagaraalaye,' which was sung at a slow pace.Fast paced renditionsIn contrast came &#8216;Jaya Jaya Padmanabha' in Sarasaangi, in Madhyamakaala tempo and the accompanying swara passages. Bhairavai was taken for alapana before the Navarathri kriti &#8216;Jananimaamava' and was tagged with niraval and swara passages. A fast paced &#8216;Bhogeendra sayinam' in Kunthalavarali set the stage for the main kriti of the evening &#8216;Raamaraama Guna seema' in Simhendramadhyamam. Sreyas rendered an erudite alapana, his full throated voice effortlessly scaling through the three octaves.While traversing through the upper octaves, he made sruthibhedam resulting in the raga Bhauli, which was later reproduced by the violinist in his solo essay. The kriti was well rendered with niraval and scintillating manodharma swaras. Nellai Ravindran on the violin and the percussion accompanists contributed to the success of the concert.A sedate &#8216;Raamachandraprabho' in Sindhubhairavi, a kriti by Vanamaamalai &#8216;Janaki Ramana' in Kaappi and an Abhang &#8216;Theerthavittala' in Aaahir bhaiarv constituted the final phase of the concert.On the second day Mathangy Sathyamoorthy accompanied by Vayala Rajendran (violin), B. Jayaram (mridangam) and Uduppi Sreekanth (ganjira) gave a memorable concert. The artiste chose a fine blend of popular and rare kritis so as to please the crowd.The &#8216;Sarasijanabha' in Kambhoji was followed by &#8216;Pahi Sreepathe' in Hamsadhwani for which she sang an array of swaras. Panthuvaraali was executed in detail and was followed by the kriti &#8216;Saarasaakshaparipalaya.'Supple voiceThis as well as &#8216;Kripayapaalaya' in Charukesi and &#8216;Maamavasada' in Kanada was well received by the audience. &#8216;Bhavaye Padmanabhayiha,' a rarely heard Madhyamaavathi kriti was rendered well. Lalyani was taken for a detailed alapana revealing all its glow and charm before the kriti &#8216;Paripahimaamayi,' which was the main item for the day. Her supple voice and amazing control over it gave an added colour to the whole concert. &#8216;Bhajabhajamaanasa' in Sindhubhairavi and a thillana in Dhanasri concluded the concert.The third day had Moozhikulam Harikrishnan, an up-and-coming singer , rendering &#8216;Rama Rama pahi' (Devagandhari), &#8216;Sree Parvathi' (Bhauli) and &#8216;Kalayedevadevam' (Ranjini) among other kritis. He showed promise during his Kalyani alapana followed by the kriti &#8216;Sundareeneedivyamu.' He was ably assisted by Aadarsh (violin), the grandson and disciple of Nedumangad Sivanandan and by Krishnachandran (mridangam).Display of histrionic skillsA Bharathanatyam solo by another promising youngster Aiswarya Raj was the final event of the festival. The dancer displayed her histrionic skills during the Bhairavi pada varnam.&#8216;Shankara Srigiri' in Hamsanandi brought out the skills as a dancer in her as she portrayed the pranks of little mischievous Krishna in &#8216;Vishamakara Kannan' of Oothukadu Venkatasubbaiyer.She wound up the recital with a Kunthalavarali tillana. Arun Gopinath (vocal), RLV Anand (nattuvangam), Raghunath (flute) and Venu Kurumassery (mridangam) were the accompanists. In addition to these there were concerts by devotees and disciples before the main concerts. The fete was organised by Sree Koodalmanickam temple.
