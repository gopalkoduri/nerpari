VThe sisters began their concert in Kochi with a  Kapi composition &#8216;Sumasayakavidhura&#8217; by Swati Tirunal. &#8216;Mahaganapathim&#8217; in Natta  was presented next. A short outline of Khamas raga and a bhava-laden rendition of Mysore Vasudevachar&#8217;s &#8216;Brochevarevarura&#8217; followed. The chittaswaram in two speeds heightened the melodic content in the song.Lalitha followed a simple  approach during the elaboration of Poorvakalyani raga. Her  well-toned voice shaped the  concert. On the other hand, Saroja was amazing with her swara singing.  &#8216;Jnanamusagarada,&#8217; a Tyagaraja kriti in Roopaka tala, was well supported by Sanjeev on the violin. H. Sivaramakrishnan&#8217;s ghatom playing was also noteworthy.The interim piece &#8216;Bhogeendrashayinam,&#8217; a Kundalavarali kriti by Swati Tirunal in Khanda chapu, brought in  rhythmic and melodic variety.  &#8216;Ramakathasudha rasa&#8217; in Madhyamavati, a masterpiece raga and composition followed.Saroja&#8217;s  husky voice traversed the patterned sancharas of the pentatonic scale with ease. The duo displayed their training under the Musiri Subramania Iyer bhani in the neraval  for the phrase &#8216;Bhamamani janaki soumitri.&#8217;Like their guru, the neravals were rich with bhava. K.R. Ganesh on the mridangam and Sivaramakrishnan performed the taniyavarthanam well. After &#8216;Rangapuravihara&#8217; in Vrindavanasaranga, the sisters presented a Malayalam devotional song, &#8216;Katharulenam&#8217; in Sindhubhairavi in praise of Lord Ayyappa. A rendition of the shloka &#8216;Karacharanakritam va&#8217; was tagged  with &#8216;Sambho Mahadeva&#8217; in Revathi raga.A popular number by the sisters, &#8216;Bhagyadalakshmi baramma&#8217; was saved for the last. All in all it was a memorable evening of music. The programme was organised by Dharani society, Kochi.
