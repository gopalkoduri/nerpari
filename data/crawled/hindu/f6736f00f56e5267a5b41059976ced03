VTHE BHAIRAVI Carnatic Music Circle, Pondicherry, which has  205 members, has been functioning for the past  22 years, organising  Carnatic music programmes, both vocal and instrumental. According to V. Mahalingam,  secretary of the Music Circle,   it has organised 247 music concerts (vocal and instrumental) so far. Programmes have also been organised for children.The Music Circle organises  a music programme every month and the one that concluded recently was  marked by the vocal recital of  O. S. Thiagarajan.  M. A. Sundaresan accompanied him on the violin,  Neyveli S. Narayanan on the mridangam and   B. Sundarakumar on the kanjira.As the day  synchronised with  Tyagaraja Aradhana,  the vocalist presented the saint-composer's kirtanas in  dexterous style.Mahalingam said the Pondicherry administration was providing the Music Circle an annual grant of Rs. 8,000, and that it was not sufficient. Therefore, it has appealed to the President, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, for the  sanction of Rs. 1 lakh per annum for the successful implementation of its programmes.  A memorandum to this effect has been  sent to the President, he added.The administration also has a multi-disciplinary wing, `Bharathiar Palkalaikoodam' that offers courses in  dance, art, music and sculpture.S.
