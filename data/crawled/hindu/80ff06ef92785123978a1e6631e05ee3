VStrict adherence to classicism,  accurate fingering, immaculate bowing and emphasis on sahitya are the hallmarks of the Lalgudi style, propounded by violin maestro Lalgudi Jayaraman. His son and disciple, G.J.R.Krishnan, showcased the Lalgudi school in his solo violin recital at The Palghat Fine Arts Society.Opening the concert with a varnam in Nalinakanthi, composed by the senior Lalgudi, Krishnan chose Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Teliyaleru Rama&#8217; (Tenuka), as the next item. The brief introduction to Kaanada, preceding the well-known Swati Tirunal kriti &#8216;Mamavasada Janani&#8217; was soaked in melody. He then presented a fine sketch of Rasikapriya, the 72nd Melakarta raga, with delightful sangathis. The Tamil kriti &#8216;Arul seyyavendumayya&#8217; by Koteswara Iyer was a welcome choice.The alapana of Kedaram, followed by the Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Anandanatanaprakasam&#8217; and the pleasing swaraprastharams woven around it were attractively played by the musicians.&#8216;Enthamuddho entha soguso,&#8217; a rare gem of Tyagaraja in the raga Bindumalini, is a favourite of the Lalgudi school; Krishnan&#8217;s interpretation of the kriti, with innovative sangatis, was marvellous.Both the Charukesi alapana and the rendition of the beautiful Tyagaraja piece &#8216;Atamotigaladhe&#8217; were not up to the connoisseur&#8217;s expectations. The Kuntalavarali kriti &#8216;Chentanesada,&#8217;a Tyagaraja composition,played in fast tempo, captured the attention of the audience.Kalyani, the main raga of the evening, was explored in depth, with a mixture of nadaswaram techniques. The sancharas in the mantra sthayi flowed with excellent manodharma. However, the neraval was conspicuous by its absence during the portrayal of &#8216;Etavunara,&#8217; the famous Tyagaraja kriti.The alapana and taanam in Vasantha were brief in content. The pallavi in Thisra jaathi Ada tala, embellished with enchanting ragamalika swaras in Ranjani, Saama, Maand, Jog, Sumanesaranjani and Behag, was well received. The melodious notes of Sindhubhairavi and the subsequent Bharathiyar song &#8216;Teeratha vilayatupillai&#8217; were soothing to the ears.Purandaradasa&#8217;s &#8216;Ramamantrava japisu&#8217; in Jonpuri was full of aesthetic beauty. Krishnan concluded the recital with a thillana in Misrasivaranjani, a composition of Lalgudi Jayaraman.Kodinthrapally K.P. Parameswaran and Udupi S. Balakrishnan lent able support. Their tani avartanam, marked by dexterous strokes, was interesting.
