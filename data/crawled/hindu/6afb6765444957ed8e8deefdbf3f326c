VWhen a film music director and a  full-fledged Carnatic musician presents a vocal concert, the raga delineation turns out to be interesting.  It could be because he  probes a particular raga from all angles to churn out many songs in the same scale.Sarath (a disciple of Balamuralikrishna)  is eager to blaze a new trail as a vocalist. Opening the concert with a delectable composition by his mentor, (a varnam in Amrithavarshani) the vocalist displayed his vocal prowess.The elaboration of &#8216;Hamsadhwani&#8217; reflected the sublime repose inherent in that raga designed by Ramaswami Dikshitar, the father of Muthuswami Dikshitar. The glides with which &#8216;Vathapi&#8217; was garnished was reflective of his ability in highlighting the bhaava.His baritone voice suited the rendition of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Evvare Ramayya.&#8217;  The aspect of Sowkhyam, a plethora of bhrigas, and clear diction made the piece a memorable one. It was followed by a detailed exploration of Thodi. Glimpses of Mohanam and Kalyani grafted to it by virtue of shruthi-bhedam, added to its majesty.A swara ragamalika attached to it, consisting of Revathy, Hamsanaadam and Vasantha, gave it a kaleidoscopic effect. Delicate flourishes helped Kapi become succulent and it was adjoined to &#8216;Jagadodharana&#8217; by Purandaradasa.Sarath wrapped up his vocal recital with a sruthi-bheda tillana created by his guru.R. Swaminathan  did an excellent job on the violin. Thani by Parassala Ravi on the mridanagam and Thiruvananthapuam Karhtikeyan on the ghatom was brief but pithy. The concert was held under the aegis of Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha in Thripunithura.
