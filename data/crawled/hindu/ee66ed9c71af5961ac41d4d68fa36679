VThe &#8216;veena-venu (flute)&#8217; combination used to be the accompaniment for Carnatic vocals until  Baluswamy Dikshitar,  at the behest of his father, Muthuswami Dikshitar, introduced the violin. Consequently, the former  appeared only in Layavinyasam and that too rarely. It augurs well for Carnatic music then that this  ensemble resurfaced again and that listeners appear to have welcomed it.A concert conducted as part of the  festival at Chakkamkulangara Siva Temple in Thripunithura, saw flautist P. Sankrakrishnan   and veena artiste Devi Vasudevan Nambuthiri match their notes.  They were flanked by Nedumangad Sivanandan on  the bow and Parassala Ravi on  the mridangam. Kangazha Vasudevan Nambuthiri and Mangadu Pramod handled the ganjira and the ghatam, respectively.Starting off with &#8216;Viriboni,&#8217; the immortal Ata tala varnam in Bhairavi by Pachimiriyam Adiappayya, the concert progressed through &#8216;Vathapi,&#8217; &#8216;Maamava Sadaa Varade,&#8217;  &#8216;Mari Vere,&#8217;  &#8216;Endaro,&#8217; &#8216;Thelisirama&#8217; and so on  before culminating in a resounding thani grafted to Chakkani.In another concert, vocalist Sanjay Subrahmaniam, who can entice listeners  with a mere turn of a musical phrase,  depicted ragas with a verve evocative of yesteryear masters.This was in evidence in the rendition of a meandering Saama in  &#8216;Saantha muleka,&#8217; a Tyagaraja kriti.  Abheri was unfurled  with the aid of &#8216;janta&#8217; swara-prayoga and the rendering of &#8216;Kaayaaroheneswaram&#8217; by Dikshitar.&#8216;Seethaapathe&#8217; in Khamas had a rich tapestry of swaras and was in good contrast to the reposeful &#8216;Thiagaraja Yoga Vaibhavam&#8217; in Anandabhairavi, which Dikshitar created in Gopucha Yathi.  Kambhoji had an alluring melodic layout which was charmingly fitted to Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Aatum Daivam.&#8217;T.H. Subrahmaniam  put up a superb performance on  the violin. Patri Satishkumar bewitched listeners with his artistry on the mridangam  while Thripunithura Radhakrishnan matched him with his prowess on the ghatam.About four decades ago, up-and-coming vocalist Tiruvenkatavalli Nambi Iyengar Sehagopalan  made his debut at this  venue  and now his son, T.N.S. Krishna, too debuted at the same venue. The young vocalist was in top form in unravelling the mysteries of Ramanathapuram style, which has been bequeathed to his father by C.S. Sankara Sivam, a disciple of Muthaiah Bhagavathar.A pedantic Panthuvarali, along with &#8216;Siva-Siva-Siva&#8217; had an opulent niraval and racy swaras. With slow, purposeful strides,  Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Amba neelaayathakshi&#8217; in Neelambari  was elaborated upon. &#8216;Bhajare Gopalam,&#8217; composed by Sadasiva Brahmendra in Hindolam, was enriched with bhriga-laden passages.Sankarabharanam  was adorned with the  technique of &#8216;grahabhedam&#8217; and glimpses of Thodi as well as Kalyani were brought out in the principal raga. &#8216;Akshayalinga Vibho,&#8217; again a Dikshithar kriti, merged well with the serene ambience of the temple.Thiruvananthapuram R. Mahadevan handled the violin well as did Thripunithura R. Rajnarayanan on the mridangam. Elenjimel Sushilkumar on the ghatam and Thrikakara Santharam on  the ganjira guided the concert to a safe finish.It was by mixing the divine and artistic aspects of Carnatic music that Ombathveli Subrahamanian Thiagarajan (O.S.T.), trained by stalwarts like T.M. Thiagarajan and Lalgudi Jayaraman, endeared himself to  rasikas.He began with the varnam &#8216;Swami daya jooda,&#8217; composed by Tiruvottriur Tyagayya in Kedaragowla and entered &#8216;Eeshapaahimam,&#8217;  in Kalyani that was embellished with a cluster of swaras.Poorvikalyani was magnificent  with succulent and dainty sancharas.  Mellifluous shades in &#8216;Padmavthiramanam&#8217; by Oothukadu Mahakavi was well projected by him  with a flurry of swaras.Arabhi was short but pithy and it was rendered through  &#8216;Paahi Paarvatha,&#8217; which was draped in niraval and swaras. Thodi was woven into a vast and colourful canvas with &#8216;Kaddanu vaariki.&#8217; M.A. Sundareswaran brought forth the Parur style on the violin.Trichur C. Narendran was brilliant on the mridangam  and Thripunithura Radhakrishnan played the ghatam with his usual fluency.
