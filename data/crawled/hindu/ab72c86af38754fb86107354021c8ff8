VINNUMERABLE CONCERTS by G.N. Balasubramanian, along with Lalgudi Jayaraman and Palakkad Raghu, including an unforgettable one held at T.D.M Hall in Kochi in the late 1950s, have left an indelible impression on rasikas. So also was the solo of Lalgudi with Raghu at Sree Poornatheayeesa Sangeetha Sabha in Thripunithura in the late 1970s.When G.J.R Krishnan and Vijayalakshmi, children of Lalgudi, teamed up with Raghu at Bhaktha Meera Temple at Vyttila in Kochi in connection with the 34th installation day ceremony of the sanctum sanctorum there, it evoked nostalgia.Taking the leadThe way in which Raghu navigated the violin duet with his timely `pharans,' `tekhas' and `theermaanam,' embellished with the `ghumkhi' of the left-bass, was bewitching. The duo had no hesitation in following Raghu, right from the Asaveri varnam (`Jalajaaksha' in Aadi), which was created by Lalgudi. Raghu, not given to theatrical gestures, encouraged the youngsters with a benevolent smile whenever they made chaste improvisations.Krishnan showed a refined dexterity while Vijayalakshmi stuck to the orthodox style. `Marupadayaa' in Mohanam (Aadi) by Karoor Chinna Devudu was played with graceful glides, according it a heaviness that is not usually experienced in instrumental concerts, even by leading maestros.This is owing to the simultaneous vocal training they received from their father. Dhanyasi unspooled smoothly with `Meenaloachani' in Chappu, by Syama Sasthri.The style in which Vijayalakshmi played Kedara Gaula had more propinquity to that of her father's and earned a lavish applause along with `Venuganaloluni' in Roopakam (composed by Thyagaraja). Rudrapriya(`Amba Paradevathe') (Ghanda chappu) by Tirunelveli Krishna Swamy Iyer, paved the way for a well spread out Kambhoji, followed by `Sree Raghuvaraaprameya' (composed by Thyagaraja) in Aadi.Again it was Krishnan who unrolled Shanmukhapriya and the initial portion of the pallavi was sung by Vijayalakshmi. Nalinakanthi, Sahana, Varali, Atana and Behaug were woven into it and it mesmerised the listeners.  Thripunithura Radhakrishnan played the ghatom with his usual gusto.JAYARAMAN VBottom Template Starts
