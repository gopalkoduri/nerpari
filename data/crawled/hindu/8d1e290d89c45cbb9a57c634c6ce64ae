VNavaratri is an important festival in India celebrated throughout the country with fervour. As part of Navaratri celebrations many temples in the capital organised Carnatic music concerts on all these nine days, enlivening the festivity. Most of the \u000aconcert space was occupied by artistes of Delhi. Delhi&#8217;s youngsters particularly participated enthusiastically and put up impressive shows at various temples in the Capital.One such spirited performance was by youngster R. Saravanan, who gave a vocal recital  during the Sri Sarada Navaratri Mahotsav at Mayur Vihar&#8217;s Shri Subha Siddhi Vinayaka Mandir. Puliyur Doreswamy Iyer&#8217;s &#8220;Sarasiruhasana&#8221; in raga Nattai was appealing. The swaraprastaras that he presented towards the end were indicative of his manodharma talents. Muthaiah Bhagavatar&#8217;s &#8220;Himagiritanaye&#8221; in raga Suddha Dhanyasi that Saravanan presented subsequently in fast tempo was impressive.Saravanan frequently performs as a violin accompanist in Delhi&#8217;s concert circle and has been accompanying local as well as visiting artistes. Singing with full throated vigour this talented youngster can establish himself as an accomplished vocalist. However, since there is shortage of local violin accompanists in the Capital, he is seen more as a violin accompanist than a vocalist. Leveraging this to his advantage, Saravanan has gained considerable experience in the manodharma aspects of concert presentation.As his main item of the recital, Saravanan thoughtfully presented Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Kamalambam bhajare&#8221; in the raga Kalyani. Earlier, he presented a fine alap of this raga, though he stretched it a bit too much. The subsequent swaraprastaras were creative. A.G. Subramanian on the violin and Delhi R. Srinivasan on the mridangam supported Saravanan during this concert. To get still better outcome, Saravanan should pay more attention to voice modulation aspects.At another concert at the same festival, youngster K. Venkateshwaran presented a scintillating vocal recital with some serious and advanced level music flowing with considerable ease. He went to the extent of presenting a slightly complex ragam-taanam-pallavi in raga Madhyamavati. The pallavi he presented was &#8220;Meenakshi Madurapuri Meenakshi Kanchi Kamakshi Kasi Visalakshi&#8221; in Adi tala (khanda nadai). He presented this pallavi neatly and confidently, exhibiting his musical talents and maturity in handling such items. Earlier, he presented a fine alap of this raga and a melodious taanam. The subsequent swaraprastaras were lively and full of creativity. R. Saravanan on the violin and Lalgudi Ganesh on the mridangam rose to the occasion by providing good and understanding support.At another venue, the Sankara Vidya Kendra, Vasant Vihar, yet another youngster Anirudh Bharadwaj presented a neat and melodious flute recital on the very first day of the Kendra&#8217;s Sri Sharada Sharannavarathra Mahotsav. Among the songs he presented, the composition of G.N. Balasubramaniam, &#8220;Saraswati namostute&#8221; in raga Saraswati was very impressive. R. Saravanan on the violin and Karthik on the mridangam provided good support.It was heartening to see temples in Delhi conducting Carnatic music concerts during festivals and endeavouring to promote fine arts.
