VThe Panchakshara Gavai Ashram in Gadag, founded by Kumar Swamiji, is a haven of tranquillity and a stronghold of music for hundreds of aspirants who wish to dedicate their lives to the serious pursuit of Hindustani music. Far from the madding crowd, \u000athis oasis of calm near Dharwar is home to those who regard music as their calling and life&#8217;s work.The ashram is run by 94-year-old guru Puttaraj Gavai who continues to teach even today. A unique feature of the ashram is the initiative taken right from its inception, to train visually challenged students with musical ability, grooming them into high calibre vocalists, harmonium and tabla artistes. &#8220;Since it is a residential facility the students&#8217; accommodation, food and everything is taken care of by the Trust, leaving them free to concentrate on music all day &#8212; gurukulavasa in earnest&#8221;, explains  managing trustee Veereshwar Madri.The compelling lure of Purya Kalyan proved hard to resist in Basavaraj&#8217;s vocal recital. This disciple of Puttaraj Gavai has a forceful style which found expression in the madhyam-emphasising phase and extended development in the pancham suite preceding a plaintive halt at the nishadh.The progressive quickening of pace in the dhrut teen tal was accomplished by a smooth transition.The welcome surprise of the following evening&#8217;s programme was Shakthi Patil&#8217;s recital. A disciple of Pandit Arjunsa Nakod (Hubli) and Pandit Sripad Hegde (Dharwar), the young vocalist captivated with her velvety texture of voice and crystalline purity of tone.Gifted with a rare composure that bestowed serenity upon every phrase, her elaboration of raag Hemant was an amalgam of liquid notes with one curve imperceptibly melting into another in a vilambit ek taal and dhrut teen taal exposition touched by emotion.The lead up to an abhang featured a Bhoop that combined simplicity with beauty and included a brief swara bheda foray into Malkauns.The accompanists Mallikarjun Shamsi (harmonium), Anantkumar Kodaganur (tabla) and Veerabhadrappa (tabla) performed with sensitivity and a keen sense of anticipation.
