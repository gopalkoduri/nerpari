VIt was an enthralling evening at the Vithunni Saneeswara Temple, Palakkad, when Ramapuram A.T. Nagarajan, an  up-and-coming artiste, presented a  refined and mellifluous Carnatic vocal concert. Adept  at reciting the Sreemad Bhagavatha moolam   and S\u000aampradaya bhajana, the devotional values in his rendition enhanced the aesthetics of the concert.Natarajan&#8217;s cultured  voice,  his judicious planning of the concert  incorporating varying  tempos and ragas and his selection of songs, both popular and rare, infused vitality into his recital.  The artiste was ably supported by Guruvayoor Rajamani on the violin and Guruvayoor Sanoj on the mridangam.With &#8216;Everibodhana,&#8217; the Adi tala varnam in  Abhogi, Nagarajan managed to establish a good rapport with the audience.The sloka &#8216;Gopalarathnam&#8217;  in  Revagupthi was followed  by &#8216;Gopalaka pahimamanisam&#8217; of Swati Tirunal, set to Misrachappu tala and adorned with &#8216;Srothovahayathi,&#8217; in the pallavi.  Another composition of Swati Tirunal, &#8216;Paramapurusha jagadeeswara jayajaya&#8217; in  Vasantha, set to Adi tala and decorated with swaraprasthara, paved the way for an expansive alapana of Bhairavi, unfurling the inherent beauty and nuances of the raga.His nourishment of the Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Chinthayama kanthamoola,&#8217; set to Roopaka tala,  brought out its  structural aesthetics and sahithya bhava.The lilting number &#8216;Paramapurusham&#8217; of Swati Tirunal in  raga Lalithapanchamam, set to Khandhachappu tala, was followed by an elaboration of  Saranga.   &#8216;Jnana sabhayil Thillai Natarajan,&#8217; a rare composition of Papanasam Sivan set to Misrachappu, was laced with artistic niraval and cascading swaraprasthara at the  lyrical sequence &#8216;Samaganavilolanai, Sivakama sundari nadhanai.&#8217;Nagarajan&#8217;s Ragam- Thanam-Pallavi in Thodi was the masterpiece of the concert. The vocalist explored the raga by weaving many attractive sancharas and showcased his creativity. Guruvayoor Rajamani gave an  equally creative and melodious response.The thana was also neatly rendered. Nagarajan  selected the pallavi &#8216;Sarsijanabha Murare, Pahi sathatham&#8217; of Swati Tirunal in Chathurasra jathi, Thriputa tala with eduppu in half edam. The pallavi was sung in thrikalam with Anulomam and Prathilomam. Sanoj&#8217;s  thani was exemplary, providing pleasurable listening experience.The vocalist wound up the concert with an unusual Swati composition, &#8216;Reena madanutha&#8217; in Behag and the mangalam &#8216;Bhujaga sayino&#8217; in Yadukulakamboji, set to Thisranada. The concert was held under the aegis of Swathi Sangeetha Sabha, Palakkad.
