VD. Sandhyasree, a vocalist of commendable talent has made it her mission to render the newly-found compositions of saint Thyagaraja in her concerts. She rendered a lullaby with pallavi,Laali loogavayyaset to tune by Nedunuri Krishnamurthy in Kedaragowla-Rupaka talam for the Hyderabad Music Circle, last week. N. Ananthakrishna on violin and Vidyasagar on the mridangam were her accompanists.The Kedaragowla varnam was followed by an invocation to Ganesha in Abhogi-Sri Mahaganapatheset to Khanadachapu talam.Both the numbers exercised her voice well. Then cameNee Sari Saatiin Hemavati, a pleasing rendition. Kannada was her first raga effort. The alapana, though precise, gave comprehensive picture of the melody. She rendered in thisIde Bhagyamuin Misrachapu.The swaraprastharam she did also reflected her rich imagination.Sarasijanabha Sodariin Naga Gandhari that came next too was a pleasing rendition. Then she took up major raga Thodi as her main effort. She elaborated it with care an\u000ad sense of beauty.InKaddanuvarikiher swaraprastharam revealed again her creative skills in variegated rhythmic patterns. The mridangist&#8217;s tani avartanam was an added attraction. But the Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi in Kalyani that she chose to presen\u000at next also stole some of the grandeur of the earlier Thodi number. Kalyani too came for detailed presentation with a methodical approach.The pallavi she coined wasParasakti brovavein Adi with four &#8216;akshara jaga&#8217; in pai kalam (upper octave) and two &#8216;akshara jaga&#8217; in the lower. It was presented well and the swaraprastharam too was well receive\u000ad. The latter part had a Purandaradasa&#8217;s compositionYare Ranganain Hindolam too.G.S.
