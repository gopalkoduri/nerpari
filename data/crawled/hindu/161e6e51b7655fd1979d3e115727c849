VThe lamps at the establishment or Khanqah of  Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia would be lit up only after a vocal or a  shehnai rendering in the twilight raga Purvi. This was a daily must since it was the favourite melody of the saint. The story goes  that there was once a temporary financial crunch at the Khanqah. The grocer who supplied the daily needs refused to make further supplies on credit unless some valuable article was mortgaged to him.Since it was the raga Purvi that was the most precious and also the dearest melody to the saint, he ordered it to be mortgaged to the grocer by not being played or sung until his dues were cleared. This incident came to  mind on listening to a vocal recital by the young and upcoming Ghulam Abbas Khan at the Stein Auditorium of the India Habitat Centre in an evening presented by Ustad Yunus Hussain Khan Memorial Society.Ghulam Abbas Khan&#8217;s handling of the raga&#8217;s intricate format, particularly with the deployment of the  Suddha and the Teevra Madhyams  effectively brought out the basic character of the melody. The opening khayal &#8220;Maien tende vaari jaawaan&#8221; set to the time cycle of 12  beats, the slow Ek tala was presented in a reposeful manner with well  elaborated alap-badhat followed  by pleasing taans and sargams.His rendering of the fast Teen tala composition dedicated to Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia, &#8220;Piya navelara payaa, Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia Mehboob Ilaahi&#8221;,   was delightful, with good handling of the lyrics  and sung with devotion. The accompanists,  Mehmood Dhaulpuri (harmonium), Kamal Sabri (sarangi) and Subhash Nirwan (tabla) provided further charm  to the young singer&#8217;s recital.A pleasing sitar recital by Prateek Choudhary was the highlight of the evening&#8217;s concert. His renderings in the raga Suddha Vasant (also known as Adi Vasant)  displayed good insight  into this ancient melody&#8217;s structure. His neat glides or  meend  were a delight to the ears. After  pleasing alap-jod sequences, a well handled Masitkhani gat-toda set to a slow tempo Teen tala was rendered with well conceived variations. His good command over  rhythm became further evident in his rendering of a mid-tempo composition set to an unusual time-cycle of eight-and-a-half beats. He concluded his recital with a fast tempo Teen tala  composition and a scintillating jhala.
