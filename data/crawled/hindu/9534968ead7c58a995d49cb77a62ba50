VFollowing Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Srivalli Devasenapathe&#8217; in Natabhairavi, Krishnan presented a detailed alapana of Lathangi preceding Patnam Subramanya Iyer&#8217;s kriti, &#8216;Marivere dikkevvaru.&#8217;Vijayalakshmi etched out the elegance of Nattakurinji for Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Kuvalayadala nayanaa&#8217; (a Divyanama sankirtanam).After a brief but poignant portrayal of Rasikapriya, they played &#8216;Arul seyya vendumayya&#8217; (Koteeswara Iyer), briskly following it with &#8216;Chentanay Sadha&#8217; in Kuntalavarali (Tyagaraja). Thodi was taken up as the main raga and as Krishnan  delineated the inherent beauty of the raga, the hall was soaked in  melody. Vijayalakshmi joined towards the end to give it the perfect finish.They presented &#8216;Gati neevani,&#8217; also by Tyagaraja in praise of Srimathi the presiding goddess of Lalgudi. The swarakalpana session was a masterly example of supportive rivalry, wherein they outdid each other, constantly providing friendly challenges.The Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi that followed was another treat. The pallavi, &#8216;Velavaa, undhan mel avaa konden&#8230;,&#8221;  was set to tisra jampa thalam (misra gathi). The lovely delineation of Ranjani was a combined effort of the siblings and they embellished the pallavi  with Varali, Saranga, Brindavana Saranga and Janasammodhini, besides Ranjani.&#8216;Janakee ramana&#8217; (Kapi), &#8216;Aiyye metha kadinam&#8217; (Ragamalika), &#8216;Venkatachala nilayam&#8217; (Sindhu Bhairavi) and the thillana in Behag formed the lighter session.Percussion support was provided by two veterans &#8212; Mannargudi Eswaran on the mridangam and Vaikom Gopalakrishnan on the ghatam.They played judiciously enhancing the violin recital during the concert, but showed their  prowess during the thani.Rajalakshmi Fine Arts had organised this pleasant concert at the Nani Palkhiwala Kalaiarangam, Coimbatore.
