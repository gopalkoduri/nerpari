VT.M.Krishna&#8217;s was a stirring concert in the Gokulashtami series of Krishna Gana Sabha. The factors that contributed to its success were voice, talent and steadfastness to classicism. It provided a glimpse into the sincerity and experience that \u000ahave shaped his performing &#233;lan.The recital began on a lively note with the kirtana, &#8216;Thulasidala&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla) followed by the Bhairavi swarajati, &#8216;Kamakshi&#8217;. As he started the item, the effect turned serene and meditative. His impulses helped him to look beyond the swaras and sahityas. From the repose of swarajati, Krishna&#8217;s beauteous Sahana burst on the audience. The persuasively elegant fluency highlighting the soothing imagery looked as if Krishna himself was enjoying the hide and seek charm of Sahana.  The kirtana was &#8216;E Vasudha&#8217;.It was on the Thodi alapana and song, &#8216;Chesinatella Marachitivo&#8217; that Krishna lavished all his eloquence. With a commanding view of the dimensions of the raga, the architecture he designed with gana-naya  nourishment, inspirational flashes and an uncanny understanding of pause and poise of sancharas the majesty of the raga was aired. The sparkling kirtana replete with pulsating sangatis provided room for the full play of Krishna&#8217;s interpretative vigour. The stunning landscape of the niraval for the line, &#8216;Rama Sri Tyagaraja Prema Avatara,&#8217; he painted with great feeling, was lapped up by the rasikas. Krishna, Sriramkumar and Umayalpuram Sivaraman, churned the ocean of swaras.In the solo versions, Sriramkumar (violin) flavoured the ragas with flair and substance.  Refinement was the cornerstone of his response to Sahana and Thodi, reflected by the excellence of the musical sentiments.In Sivaraman&#8217;s thani there were strands of reverberating profundity.  As a mridangam accompanist he underlined his value to the concert. B. Sreeramkumar on the kanjira toed the line.
