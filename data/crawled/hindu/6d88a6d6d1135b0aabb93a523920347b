VWith her soft and highly tuneful voice, Krishna Birdi, a close disciple of the Gwalior gharana doyen Laxman Krishnarao Pandit, captivated  her discerning audience by rendering khayals and a couple of semi-classical numbers at a well-organised concert presented by Sangeet Surabhi of East Delhi at the PSK (Poorva Sanskritik Kendra) auditorium, 14 District Centre, Laxmi Nagar.By commencing her recital of the evening with a khayal in raga Kedar (of Kalyan thaat) &#8220;Barakha ritu ki&#8221; set to the 12-beat slow Ek tala, Krishna established an instant rapport with her audience. She elaborated it with well deployed alap-badhat-behelwa-sargam-taans, all of which were tightly knit and neatly enunciated.She was equally at her best with the fast 16-beat Teen tala composition in the same raga &#8220;Kanganwa mora ata hi amola&#8221; wherein Krishna deployed quite a few  liltingly phrased variations.Equally haunting was her next rendition in the season&#8217;s raga, Sur-Malhar, said to be a creation of Sant Surdas.The mid-tempo Teen tala composition &#8220;Badarwa garajan ko aaye&#8221; was rendered with the raga&#8217;s form well maintained and the lyrics rendered with intense feeling.The thumri in the pentatonic raga Dhani was a welcome change since one listens to thumris mostly in ragas like the Khamaj, Kafi, Piloo, Jangla and Bhairavi.The tunefully rendered saawani at the end was a befitting finale to her recital, for which Balloo Khan Warsi provided commendable accompaniment on the harmonium, while Abhijit Aich, a disciple of Shankar Ghosh, was a sheet anchor on rhythm.One would have liked Krishna to slightly prolong her renderings.However, it was the male compere who remained on the stage a bit too long.
