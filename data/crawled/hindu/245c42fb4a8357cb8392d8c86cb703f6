VThe outstanding feature of Annamayya&#8217;s life was the harmonisation of the soul&#8217;s devotional inwardness with the delights of songs. For him the Highest Supreme, Lord Venkateswara, stood exalted and his sankirthana testifies to the appropriateness of the blend of mystical and bhakti aspects.Nedunuri&#8217;s recital imbibed all these sentiments. Being one involved in setting tunes to many Annamacharya songs, and being a Telugu, a listener could easily sense his identification with the core of the songs.To some extent his performance also proclaimed that Annamacharya&#8217;s compositions can be presented with classical weightage  and not just showed to the &#8216;thukkada&#8217; section of a concert.The Bahudari piece &#8216;Sakala-Shanti-Karamu-Sarvesa&#8217; struck the first note in the journey of devotional contents that followed. His familiarity  with Annamacharya&#8217;s mind through the several songs tuned by him characterised his visionary sympathy with the message of the songs he rendered. The list induced the rasikas to reconstruct the shining soul of the composer. That is possible only when the vidwan was transparent to Annamacharya&#8217;s bhakti, which Nedunuri was.Two compositions stood out &#8212; &#8216;Palu-Vichaaramu&#8217; in Shanmukhapriya and &#8216;Ade Choodare&#8217; in Mohanam. Beyond the externalised exposition lay the aesthetics of music &#8212; both in the songs and the alapanas that preceded them. The raga vinyasas recorded, in the development step by step, the impressions of manodharma with precision. It spoke of the extraordinary discipline which gave shape to the over-all picturisation.But for striking and immaculate sensitivity, the Khamas alapana and the song &#8216;Avataru-Raghupathy&#8217; were poetic presentations. Here the violin accompanist Sriram Parasuram presented an intensely detailed beauty of Khamas. This item both by Nedunuri and Sriram Parasuram represented one of the inspiring moments of the concert.&#8216;Purushottamula-Neevu&#8217; in Revagupti and &#8216;Ramabhadra-Raghuvira&#8217; set in a folk tune in Anandabhairavi peppered the programme. Even at this age, Nedunuri Krishnamurthy&#8217;s presentation emphasised one cardinal truth &#8212; there is a big difference between singing competently and scaling great heights in handling a concert. One of the Malladi brothers, Ravi Kumar, provided pertinent vocal support.At every stage of the recital the violinist&#8217;s contribution was pamperingly enjoyable, classic in quality and refined in taste. The subtleness of the same pattern in alapanas provided the icing to them. Vellore Ramabhadran was the mridangist with P. V. Vasan (ghatam) as his associate. Unassuming and self-effacing Ramabhadran left it to the precision and variations of his play to speak for him. His fingers tuned to an elegant  refinement wrapped up the beats in a melodic garb.
