VAndal is well-known for her all-consuming love for Lord Vishnu which she has immortalised through her Tiruppavai and Nachiar Tirumozhi. That she was probably the first woman  composer in the world was a new piece of information. The thevarams by the &#8216;Thevara Moovar&#8217; (Appar, Sundarar and Sambandar) are available today almost in their pristine purity.  The Odhuvars  have been singing them in the temples in their original tunes. The poems had been set in various Panns (ragas) many of which have their equivalents in Carnatic music &#8212; (Puraneermai-Bhoopalam, Kausikam-Bhairavi and Sadhari-Panthuvarali, to name a few).Radha pointed out that Tirugnana Sambandar had embedded his name in &#8216;Mandhiramavadhu Neeru&#8217; and initiated the practice of using mudras. She was liberal in her praise of Saint Arunagirinathar, the incomparable master of rhythm. Till today, no other composer has attempted such a composition with such unique metres and rhythms. She demonstrated this with &#8216;Orupozhudhum Iru Charana,&#8217; with an astounding rhythm pattern.By the time Arunachalakkavirayar came into the picture, the compositions had undergone refinement and instead of the same metre getting repeated, pallavi, anu pallavi and charanam had started appearing. His &#8216;Rama Nadaka Kirtanas,&#8217; set to tune by Venkatarama Iyer and Kodandarama Iyer have gained immoral status.  Then she spoke about Muthu Thandavar and Marimutha Pillai, who together with Arunachalakkavirayar, are known as the &#8216;Seerkazhi Moovar&#8217;. They had lived nearly 500  years before the Carnatic Trinity.&#8216;Oothukkadu Venkatakavi&#8217; was another significant pre-trinity composer. His mastery over Sanskrit and Tamil, along with his penchant for jathi and laya has resulted in delightful songs steeped in the joy of devotion. Though most of his popular kritis were on Krishna, Venkatakavi had composed songs on many deities including songs on Valmiki and Jayadeva.While talking about Gopalakrishna Bharati, Radha mentioned his Ghana raga pancharatna kritis which had madhyama kala sahityas like those of Tyagaraja. Subramanya Bharati&#8217;s standing fame is not only due to his poems filled with patriotic fervour, but also  to his devotional and deeply philosophical songs. &#8216;Koteswara Iyer&#8217;s speciality is that he gave swaroopa to many ragas which had not been used by composers earlier. He has also composed songs in all melakarta ragas.Neelakanta Sivan, along with his disciple Papanasam Sivan, has contributed significantly not only in quality, but also in quantity. With his nearly 2,000  compositions, Papanasam Sivan is called &#8216;Tamil Tyagayya.&#8217;Ambhujam Krishna&#8217;s kritis are famous for their wonderful imagination, chaste language and clarity of thought. Periasamy Thooran, the dedicated teacher, die-hard patriot and composer of merit, has given lilting melodies in Kavadi Sindu mettu and melting kritis full of bhakti. Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s varnams and tillanas are much sought after for their meaning and melody. He carefully camouflages subtle rhythmic intricacies in his seemingly simple compositions.Radha Bhaskar concluded her lec-dem with the compositions of Rukmini Ramani (daughter of Papanasam Sivan) who has sincerely followed her father&#8217;s style.
