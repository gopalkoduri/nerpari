VCharulatha Mani's vocal concert under the auspices of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore, was characterised by vocal imbalance and lack of intelligent communication skills.Though her concert-cum-lec-dem helped the rasikas to an extent, it failed to make an impact on them. &#8216;Evaribodha' (Abhogi) was her opening piece. Her alapana of Bahudari for the kriti, &#8216;Brovabharama' with some astounding sancharas had a compelling charm.But her voice did not cooperate in the upper reaches for the swaras rendered for the kriti, &#8216;Akhilandeswari' (Dwijavanti).The raga vinyasams of Hamsanandhi for the kriti, &#8216;Sreenivasa Thiruvengadamudayan' and Kharaharapriya for &#8216;Samanamevaru' were marked by jarring notes in the higher octaves.Charulatha's abhang towards the end was heart-warming. Honing her presentation skills should make her a top-ranking artist.Ananthakrishnan painted sensitive portraits of Hamsanandhi and Kharaharapriya with stress on contemplative search. Manikandan's percussive support revealed finesse.
