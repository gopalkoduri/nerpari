VElectronic gadgets like computers, mobile phones, Internet, etc., considered luxuries few years ago, are now necessities in every household. Children are quick in mastering the operation of these gadgets, but are ironically also slaves to them, and it is difficult to wean them away. But, these children, about a dozen of them, were doing an altogether different thing the other day in neighbouring Noida. They were singing Tyagaraja's pancharatna kritis along with their guru, Vasanthy Krishna Rao, during a programme organised by Sri Vishnu Sahasranama Satsangam, Noida, to pay homage to the legendary saint. Their strict adherence to the traditional dress code and synchronised rendering were striking features. After the invocation to Lord Vinayaka, &#8220;Sriganapatini&#8221;, in raga Saurashtra, the guru and her disciples (a good majority of these children) rendered all the five pancharatna kritis. The group concluded with &#8220;Gitarthamu&#8221; in raga Suruti. The efforts of the guru and the hard work of her disciples got reflected in their performance. K. Sreeram's mridangam support was soothing.Vasundhra Enclave Sarvesvara Samaj too organised group singing of pancharatna kritis, led by K. Vageesh, in their temple complex. Sadly, the domination of percussion accompaniment did not evoke a pleasant listening experience.The three-day programme of Sri Vishnu Sahasranama Satsangam at Noida included two other major events &#8212; conducting of two celestial marriages. Valli Kalyanam was conducted by the Delhi-based Thiruppugzhal Anbargal and Radha Kalyanam by another Delhi-based organisation, Sri Vishnu Sahasranama Sankeertana Mandali led by Subbarama Bhagavatar and Shankara Subramania Avadhani. While the latter was in the Bhajan Paddhati, where the songs were mostly in Sanskrit and Telugu, in the former the songs were drawn from the works of Saint Arunagirinathar and were in Tamil.Carnatic vocalIn another event in the Capital, as part of their 43rd anniversary celebrations, Sri Vishnu Sahasranama Satsangam, R.K. Puram, organised a Carnatic vocal recital by Sikkil C. Gurucharan. Gurucharan delighted the audience during his recital that lasted close to three hours. Papanasam Sivan's &#8220;Balaakrishnan&#8221; in raga Dhanyasi, Muthuswami Dikshitar's &#8220;Kamalambam&#8221; in Kalyani and the ragamalika vruthams were reflective of his musical depth.Gurucharan rendered both these compositions in a detailed manner. In his delineation, he brought out the complete essence of the ragas Dhanyasi and Kalyani. His creative talents came to the fore when he presented niraval of phrases form both these compositions and the subsequent swaraprastaras.VSK Chakrapani on the violin, K.N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam and K. Ramamurthy on the ghatam provided able support. Chakarapani's sketch of Dhanyasi was delightful. However, he could have avoided those few harsher touches during his sketch of Kalyani. The percussionists' tani avartanam in Adi tala was enjoyable and was well appreciated by the audience.It is heartening to note that a full fledged Carnatic music concert has become a regular feature in the Satsangam's anniversary celebrations.
