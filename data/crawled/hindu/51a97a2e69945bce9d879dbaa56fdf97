VWhen Gayatri Sankaran sang the famous &#8216;Kurai Ondrum Illai&#8217; in her ringing tone with involvement one could not help being  moved; her visually challenged disposition could hardly deter her passion, commitment and expertise in music.With her opportunities of enviable training in the celebrated Kalakshetra and at present with music maestro Lalgudi Jayaraman, Gayatri&#8217;s  powerful musical communication makes her physical handicap pale into insignificance.&#8216;Re Re Manasa Bhajare&#8217; in Nattai provided a good start for her concert for the ICCR (Indian Council for Cultural Relations) and Shri Ariyakudi Music Foundation organised concert at Sastri Hall. The naturally high pitched vocal ability instinctively let Gayatri traverse even the difficult passages in the tara sthayee region effortlessly.If Gayatri  watches out her  articulation, the slight shrill which at times has a grating effect  could be avoided.  Gayatri Sankaran selected Hindolam and Kalyani to  demonstrate her originality through alapana and kalpanaswara. Her phrases were mostly short and crisp and the akaras and brigas rolled out quite spontaneously. Since she has the range in her command, Sankaran can preferably pay more attention to  exposition through  careful voice modulation and relaxing phrases. The Hindolam alapana was appended with &#8216;Ramanukku Mannan Mudi&#8217; of Arunachala Kavi. The swaras she added at &#8216;Pattam Katta Etravandi&#8217; were smartly woven. Kalyani raga projected by Gayatri was quaint and with a bright  &#8216;Ammaravamma,&#8217; the well linked kalpanaswaras landing on the ascending notes of the Kalyani raga arohana converged into a fitting korvai at &#8216;Tamarasa Dalanetri Tyagarajuni Mitri.&#8217; On the heavier side Gayatri added &#8216;Kanja Dalaya Dakshi&#8217; in Kamala Manohari and &#8216;Nee Irangayenil&#8217;in Atana while the lighter side included &#8216;Matha Parasakthi&#8217; of Bharati in ragamalika and &#8216;Karunai Deivame&#8217; in Sindubhairavi apart from &#8216;Kurai Ondrum Illai.&#8217;Violinist T.K. Padmanabhan aided Gayatri in the concert with his matching support in raga vinyasas and swara sallies. Thanjavur S. Subramaniam&#8217;s beats were conspicuously subdued but enjoyable even in the &#8216;thani&#8217; set in chapu talam.
