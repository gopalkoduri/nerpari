VIn his moving tribute to Kalamandalam Neelakandhan Nambeesan, the doyen of Kathakali music Krishnankutty Poduwal observed: &#8220;With the demise of Nambeesan, the tone of Kathakali in vocal music has faded while the musical content itself has been growing. For what?&#8221;If Poduwal had a chance to listen to the CD titled &#8216;Abhivadaye,&#8217;  he would have heaved  a sigh of relief. Madambi Subramanyan Namboodiri and Kalamandalam Subramanyan,  disciples of Nambeesan, have sung select slokams and padams from  different Kathakali plays in this CD.Vazhenkada Kunju Nair Trust, Karalmanna, guided them in their endeavour.Beginning with a &#8216;Vandanaslokam&#8217; in raga Kedaragaulam, the singers stick pretty much to the traditional structure all through out the CD. &#8216;Mukhajaalam,&#8217; a piece customarily taught in the kalari of Kathakali music, is a distinctive treat with the akaraalaapana.Unlike  Sankaran Embranthiri, Madambi and Subramanyan deploy  a minimum of flourishes while singing  popular padams such as &#8216;Saravedi&#8217; in &#8216;Uttaraswayamvaram&#8217; and &#8216;Lokapaalanmare&#8217; in &#8216;Nalacharitam.&#8217;  &#8216;Saravedi&#8217; is sung in two different ragas &#8211; Kalyani and Kharaharapriya.The slokam &#8216;Gunavathy&#8217; in raga Indalam sounds too close to Puranira. It is high time a musicologist explored the swara-structure of both these regional ragas.  Two unusual padams, &#8216;Yamini&#8217; and &#8216;Nrihare! Karakalithare&#8217; in raga Varali and Kanakkurinji respectively,  do have a special feel to the rendition.  &#8216;Sudathi mamaka nayike,&#8217; a padam in raga Mohanam, is alluring to the ears. Madambi has a charming and appealing accent while rendering the Mohanam.The soul-stirring slokams in the Kiratham play form the concluding segment. Here, &#8216;Haraharasiva sambho&#8217; in raga Saveri, sung by Arjuna to Lord Siva, is  poignant.Madambi and Subramanyan are undoubtedly vocalists sans artistic pretensions and an affected voice-culture.Neither briga nor gamakam consumes the spirit of their singing. The difference between their singing in the kalari and on stage is fairly thin. While this is a sign of genuineness and artistic transparency, bhava-oriented music demands more than structural finesse. Nevertheless, it is a good addition to the audio-archive of traditional performing arts.Kathakali PadangalThiranottamPrice: Rs. 50
