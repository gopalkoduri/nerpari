VThe programmes, held at Sreemoolasthanam of the temple in a specially erected auditorium, began with T.N. Krishnan&#8217;s violin concert and speech.The maestro recapitulated his association with Thrissur right from early childhood. He reminisced how he was chosen by Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar to accompany him in a concert in Thrissur town as Mysore Choudiah failed to turn up. He was only seven then.His concert highlighted an unmatched swaraprasthara. His distinctive  bowing technique, marked by soft movements and deft fingering, are the  hallmarks of his artistry.He opened with &#8216;Mahaganapathim manasa smarasmi,&#8217; a Dikshitar composition in Natta set to  Adi tala. Amritavarshini received a neat portrayal as he switched on to &#8216;Evaarani nirnaya.&#8217;TNK&#8217;s virtuosity in elaborating  a raga to highlight its  singular phrases and portray its  varied shades was demonstrated in the essaying of Panthuvarali for which he chose the  Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Siva Siva Siva yena rada&#8217; in Adi tala.While &#8216;Paridana michithe,&#8217; Patnam Subramania Iyer&#8217;s composition in Bilahari, set to  khanda chappu, was melodious, Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi (RTP) in Shanmughapriya was delectable with Mohanam, Kapi and Surutty emerging in sequence.A notable number in the post-RTP section was &#8216;Chandraselhara, eesa jagatheesa,&#8217; a Tamil composition in Sindhubhairavi.A two-hour jugalbandhi by Ramesh Narayanan and Ananthapadmanabhan was enthralling for the forays they made into the delineation of the ragas Purya Dhanasree, Abheri and Darbarikannada.A notable feature was the way in which veena artiste Anananthapadmanabhan followed the vocalist in  the typical Hindustani style but switched  to the Carnatic style while playing independently.Balasai (Chennai) presented a flute recital that was patterned on the typical Carnatic concert format. He began  with an Adi tala varnam &#8216;Chalamela,&#8217; a composition of Sreerangam Rangaswamy Nattuvanar in Nattakurinji.The verve created by the varnam was maintained in &#8216;Gajananayutham Ganeswaram,&#8217; a Dikshitar composition in Chakravakam, set to Adi tala.The recital attained a new dimension with the misra chappu composition of Swati in Charukesi, &#8216;Kripaya palaya soure.&#8217;Poorvikalyani was the main raga and the composition was &#8216;Parama pavana Rama&#8217; of Ramanathapuram Srinivasa Ayyankar in Adi tala.Kavalam Sreekumar sang  select compositions. Among them, a  Dwijavanthi composition of Kavalam Narayana Panicker in Malayalam, &#8216;Saantham,&#8217; created a tranquil ambience.Other notable renditions were Neelakantan Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Aanandanatanamaaduvar&#8217; in Poorvikalyani  and Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s composition in Mohanam,  &#8216;Kapaali.&#8217;The festival also featured  vocal concerts by Sudha Varma, Vamanan Namboothiri, Girija Varma, Muralidharanunni, Thullal pada kacheri by Kalamandalam Gitanandan and troupe, Sopana Sangeetham by Njaralathu Harigovindan, Vadya samanwayam, directed by K.
