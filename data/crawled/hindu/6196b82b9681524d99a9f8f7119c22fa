VBy her distinctive performance, Savitha Narasimhan justified Kalki Foundation's choice as the recipient of this year's award. Carnatic classical stimulation was the guiding factor in her expressions.The sancharas in her raga alapana of Nattakurinji and Sankarabharanam were replete with aesthetic impulses.The development of the ragas was concise and carefully structured providing a good perspective of their characteristic shades. Usha Rajagopalan on the violin covered the ragas on the lines of the vocalist.Felicitous flavourThe selection of the kirtanas "Kanchdalaaya" (Kamalamanohari) "Mokshamugalada" (Sarathy) "Vazhi-Maraittirukkude" (Nattakurinji) and "Thookkia-Tiruvadi" (Sankarabharanam) helped her to give a felicitous flavour to her interpretation. She imparted tonal fervour to lift the impact.J. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) another awardee of the year, delightfully linked his percussive support to brighten up Savitha Narasimhan's musical process. The sparkle and range of his art formed the texture of his dignified play. Guru Prasad was the ghatam artiste.SVKBottom Template Starts
