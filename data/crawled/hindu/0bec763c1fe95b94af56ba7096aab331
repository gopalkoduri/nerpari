VYoung V. Remaa is one more dynamic and demonstrative vocalist with great potential.  Her concert for Balaganamruthum/KCP Monsoon Music Marvel at Sastri Hall testified this.Trained by competent gurus such as Padma Chandilyan, Srimushnam Raja Rao and violinist S Varadarajan (she can play violin also), Remaa&#8217;s musical talents are commendable. On the plus side are a rich resonant voice and  confidence. It is over-enthusiasm that she should watch out for.A full throated  Kedaragowla varnam flagged off Remaa&#8217;s less-than-90-minute concert.&#8216;Deva deva kalayami&#8217; in Mayamalavagowla with a long ungainly swara segment following a fairly lengthy niraval at &#8216;Jatha roopa nipa chela&#8217; proved that Remaa needs to be time conscious, notwithstanding the fact  that the swara deluge drew applause.And she devoted more time to Kharaharapriya (Janaki Pathe)   than the main Varali (&#8216;Eti janmam itiha&#8217;) that came later.Remaa&#8217;s raga alapana maintained the mandatory parts of reposeful karvais and brigas to make them appealing. Yet she seemed to be in a hurry to showcase all that she has learnt so far.The kalpanaswara strings went at a breakneck speed almost drowning the notes to mere syllables; because of this even well-knit kuraippu swaras got reduced to a mere arithmetic exercise robbing them of aesthetic charm.On the positive side, Remaa&#8217;s Hamir Kalyani handling and the slender twists and bends given to her slow rendition of the Thiruppavai &#8216;Thoomani madathu&#8217; were pleasing to hear.The concluding &#8216;Srinivasa Thiruvengada&#8217; in Hamsanandi preceded by the pasuram in Shanmukhapriya and Hamsanandi spoke well of Remaa&#8217;s involvement.Another youngster Chidambaram Badrinath played the violin matching in quality to Remaa&#8217;s fast and slow singing.A few more soft touches and sensitive bowing would have definitely made the difference.Arjun Ganesh scored agreeably in his percussion prop.
