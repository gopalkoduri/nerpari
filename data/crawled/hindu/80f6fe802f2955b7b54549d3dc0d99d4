VVeteran violin maestro Chandrasekharan&#8217;s concert in Kochi proved to be a blend of choice compositions that were enhanced by the mark of classicism.  Overall, the concert had the sheen of professionalism and experience.The concert, which started with &#8216;Sidhivinayakam&#8217; in Shanmukhapriya raga, had succinct swara passages. The grandeur of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Inthanuchu varnimpa tharama&#8217; was brought out by Chandrasekharan&#8217;s violin.Chandrasekharan tried to throw light on the  sahitya of each of the compositions by singing the initial pallavi before playing the rest of the composition on the violin. He  was accompanied by his daughter Bharati on the violin. The father-daughter duo played in perfect harmony and followed a strick patanthara. This was  highlighted in the melancholic Bindumalini song &#8216;Enthamuddo enthasogaso.&#8217;&#8216;Suma sayaka,&#8217; a Swati Tirunal composition in Kapi, was wound up by a ragamalika comprising Kalyani Kamas, Vasantha, and Mohanam.This was followed by a favourite of the violinists, the Pattanam Subrmania Iyer composition &#8216;Parithanameeerchithe&#8217; in Bilahari raga. A dulcet short sketch of Bilahari had quick flashing sancharas. Bharati&#8217;s skill on the violin came to fore with a vignette of Bhairavi raga; the etch on the nishadam and her fast sancharas left the listeners enthralled.The father-daughter team broke into a two-kalai Adi tala composition &#8216;Koluvayya&#8217; as Balakrishna Kammath provided the rhythmic support on the mridangam. The layavinsam between Kammath&#8217;s mridangam and Vinod Mallya on the ganjira was excellent.Chandrasekharan harmed the listeners with a ragamalika in Malayalam, &#8216;Karmukilvarnante,&#8217; in ragas Bageshri and Desh. &#8216;Bhagyadalakshmi baramma&#8217; in Sriraga lent the right finish to the concert. The event was organised by Rasikapriya.
