VForging a style of one&#8217;s own, taking into account one&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses,  helps a Carnatic vocalist to tide over initial obstacles in shaping a career of his or her own.  If such a vocalist can delineate ragas correctly, render k\u000aritis with a clean diction and also come up with  manodharma swaras, then his or her career will  have an upward movement.V.R. Dileepkumar from Thrissur, a disciple of Mangad Nateshan, has all these qualities. His concert at  Rugmini Kalyana Mandapam, Thripunithura, was organised in connection with a  function that was held to observe the  first death anniversary of Thripunithura S.K. Subrahmaniam, (Raju Maash), who always strived hard to provide ethereal music.  His career mostly pivoted around the role of an exacting teacher and a long association with All India Radio.Dileepkumar began the concert with &#8216;Intha moadi,&#8217; a varnam in Saranga composed by  Tiruvottriyur Thiagayyar. Next came &#8216;Seethapathe,&#8217; a Tyagaraja composition in Kamas,  which was laced with a  dazzling tapestry of swara-singing.The innate lilt in Devagandhari was effectively highlighted through the Swati composition &#8216;Rama rama paahi.&#8217;&#8216;Pranathaarthi haraaya&#8217; in Samantha raga was popularised by D.K. Pattammal. It was one among the many gems of Muthuswami Dikshitar that was imparted to her by Ambi Dikshitar, the grandson. It behove well for the inquisitiveness of the young vocalist to unearth such a rare composition.Mohanakalyani was rendered well.  &#8216;Seve sreekantham,&#8217; composed by Swati Tirunal, sweetly merged with it. After &#8216;Nagagandhariraganuthe&#8217; by Dikshithar, a  dexterous exploration of Kapi won generous applause from the audience.  &#8216;Inthasowkhyamani,&#8217; which is often pointed out as an example of the lucid but cultural language Tyagaraja often used, was sung with aesthetic and technical finesse.Thiruvizha Viju S. Aanand accompanied on the violin with a fine bowing technique.Thrissur B. Jayaram came up with interesting rhythmic patterns on the mridangam. Adichanallur Anilkumar handled the ghatom with his usual fluency.
