VInjikkudi E.M.Subramaniam&#8217;s recital was a class act from start to finish. From a little-known composition of Thanjavur Sankara Iyer, &#8220;Amba Sri Parameshwari in Hamsakalyani crackling with crisp &#190; -idam swaras and a racy &#8220;Telisirama&#8221; ( Poornachandrika, Tyagaraja) the artiste progressed to the main piece &#8220;Nee Pada Pankaja&#8221; in Begada. Testifying to Subramaniam&#8217;s tutelage under Sankara Iyer, the alapana was structured around the veena-vocal approach instead of the customary breath-defying nagaswaram phraseology. To excellent effect.Concise, sturdy madhyamakala phrasing and steady karvais reinforced form, with just the right touch of filigree. The tani by Tirukkarugavur T.D. Sivagurunathan and Veliyambakkam V.M.Palanivel was an eye opener, as always. With razor-sharp sollus even at top speed, volatile permutations setting the tisra and khanda nadais ablaze, the fiery exchange was a thrill-a-moment ride.The light segment was awash with vivid hues that kaleidoscoped in a fiesta of freewheeling manodharma.A haunting Subhali (janya of Subhapantuvarali) more alaap than alapana transported you to Ustad-dom as did &#8220;Nandanandana,&#8221; the composition made famous by Lata Mangeshkar&#8217;s dulcet rendition.A shehnai seemed hidden within the nagaswaram&#8217;s depths in a shimmering Sindhu Bhairavi and the MLV-favourite &#8220;Manadhirkku Ugandhadhu,&#8221; while &#8220;Kurai Ondrum Illai&#8221; and &#8220;Chinnanchiru kiliye&#8221; went far beyond prosaic renditions. Thirukkannamangai T.N. Swaminathan lent excellent nagaswaram support.Srirangam S. Kasim and S. Babu&#8217;s kriti-based recital was by dominated Trinity compositions. The duo&#8217;s approach was characterised by the rapid progression of neatly arraigned sangathis in krithis and concentric-whorl summations at pallavi/anupallavi/charanam endings as seen in Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Nee Vaadane Gaana&#8221; (Saranga). Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Chandram Bhaja Manasa&#8221; was profiled in serene repose.The Madhyamavathi alapana emphasised the tara sthayi rishabha, with interlinked passages leading from and to this suite.In Syama Shastri&#8217;s &#8220;Palinchu Kamakshi,&#8221; scrupulous attention to patanthara detail was evident in the varied shades of the nishadha at &#8220;Swantamaku.&#8221; In the main Sankarabharanam, the thrust was on a prolonged sojourn at the tara sthayi gandhara that earned spontaneous applause.Lively sarvalaghu swaras added interest to Subburama Dikshitar&#8217;s sonorous &#8220;Shankaracharyam.&#8221; Sparks flew in the vigorous tani by Kovilur K.G.Kalyanasundaram and Naangur N.K. Selvaganapathy.In A.K.C. Natarajan&#8217;s clarionet recital, the veteran musician presented a succinct Begada sketch followed by &#8220;Vallabha.&#8221; The Valaj exposition was replete with lyrical glides and wide-spanning jarus, the swara kuraippu made absorbing by punchy kanakku.The main piece, a grand Thodi alapana illuminated by brilliant flashes, sent superfast sancharas whirring down from the tara sthayi gandhara in overwhelming profusion. Other krithis included Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Akhilandeswari&#8221; (Dwijavanthi) and Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Ninnade&#8221; (Kannada).The tani featuring senior vidwan Thiruvalaputhur T.A.Kaliamurthy and Thiruppungur T.G. Muthukumarasami was a much anticipated treat that more than lived up to its promise.The artists coaxed irresistible configurations  in the sarvalaghu segments before moving on to complicated cross rhythms demanding cutting edge precision.A dizzying variety of single, half and quarter avartana permutations tested avid rasikas&#8217; tala-keeping skills before culminating in the grand finale that brought the house down.
