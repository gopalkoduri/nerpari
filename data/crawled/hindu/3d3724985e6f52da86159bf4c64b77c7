VT. K. GANAPATHYJudicious selection of ragas and kritis, after careful homework, aesthetic refinement and a clear stream of interpretative expression lent a  soft touch to all of Sowmya's  renditions  under the auspices of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore.The vishranti and sukham in her cutcheri left a lasting impression on the minds of the rasikas.Featuring all sampradaya kritis, javalis and padams, Sowmya shed sowmyam and elegance in her neat presentations.Her winsome start of the Ata tala varnam  "Kamalasri" in Yadukulakambodhi followed by "Kanchadalayadakshi" (Kamalamanohari) established instant rapport with the listeners.Charming alapanaSowmya's  charming Anandabhairavi alapana  awakening the rakti made the song, "O! Jagadamba" dignified without any strain in the tara sthayi.A rare swara jathi in Useni bounded the structural excellence with all loveliness. Oothukkadu's "Paal Vadiyum Mugam" in Nattakurinji was sung evocatively.The sparkle in her raga vinyasam of Todi in telling sancharas laced with aesthetic finesse for "Munnuravana" was the crème-de-la crème of the programme.Violinist Sreeramkumar portrayed commendable raga sketches of Anandabhairavi and Todi. Narayanan (mridangam) and Sridhar (ghatam) attempted their roles with laya.Bottom Template Starts
