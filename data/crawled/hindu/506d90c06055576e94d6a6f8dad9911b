VRenowned dolu player Tarigoppula Narayana demonstrated his mastery and speed in the tala system (science of rhythmic beats) at Ravindra Bharathi this week. His aim was to find a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. This was organised by Andhra Pradesh Mangala Vayidya Kalaakaarula Sangham.The South Indian Tala System of Carnatic music is authentic and has elaborate grammar. The tala structures are the same as in the case of vocal supporting mridangam or any other rhythmic instrument that go with Carnatic music.T. Narayana, the well known &#8216;dolu' player of A.P. mastered the art to such a level that he can play all the classical talas (rhythm beats) in one sweep. He is a &#8216;top class' artiste of AIR and is capable of playing 35 talas in just fifteen minutes and under, changing from one scale to another with enviable mastery. He is such a virtuoso percussionist that he can create incredible grooves as well as intricate solos in all possible time cycles.Tala is a rhythmic cycle made up of a number of beats. In the Carnatic rhythmic system, the shortest cycle is made up of three beats whereas the longest cycle has 29 beats. It is a difficult process. The base for all these talas are laghu (denoted by I) is a clap of the hand followed by counting of the fingers; these counts could vary from 3 to 4 to 5 to 7 to 9, based on the jatis (rhythmic cycles). Drutam (denoted by O) is a clap of the hand followed by a wave of the hand; it is a fixed unit of two beats. Anudrutam (denoted by U) is simply a clap of the hand; it is a fixed unit of one beat. The Tala System is made up of 7 parent Talas: Dhruva, Matya, Rupaka, Jhampa, Triputa, Ata, and Eka. These in turn have 5 variations, each based upon the &#8216;Laghu' variables, that is 3 or &#8216;Tishra', 4 or &#8216;Chaturasra', 5 or &#8216;Khanda', 7 or &#8216;Mishra' and 9 or &#8216;Sankirna'. Thus the 7 Parent Talas multiplied by 5 Jatis equals 35 Talas. Narayana played all these Talas in sweep. On this occasion he played all these Talas in just 12 minutes and 21 seconds. A CD was also immediately produced as its proof.To add to the festive mood two Nadaswara players of Sri lanka - P.S. Balamurugan and P.S. Jayasankar were invited to accompany dolu players M.R.Vasudevan of Tamilnadu and A.D. Narayana of Hyderabad. The brief repertoire comprised of Balamurali's Purahari Perumal in Hasadhwani followed by Samaganalola in Hindolam. Pibareramarasam of Sadasiva Brahmendra in Yamunakalyani, and Venkatachala Nilayam of Purandaradasa in Sindhubhairavi were other notable numbers.
