VThe day being Thiruvaadhirai (Arudra Darshanam) the artiste presented several compositions celebrating Siva, Lord of Kailasa. Whether in the pithy verses that served as viruttam, the emotive articulation of sahitya in kritis or the powerful surges of raga, the predominant rasa was bhakti, as one perceived the artiste&#8217;s surrender to a higher power that raised his music to a lofty plane.The journey began with the verse &#8216;Paal Ninaindhoottum&#8217; and Achyuthadasar&#8217;s &#8216;Sadhaananda Taandavam&#8217; (Bahudari) in which intensity powered lyric.Nimble kalpanaswaras included poruthams that highlighted &#8216;Sadhaa&#8217; as swarakshara.The artiste wove contrasting threads into a supple fabric in the Pantuvarali alapana, the shadja-varja &#8216;dha, ni, ri&#8217; permutations evoking an air of meditative solitude.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Siva Siva Siva Ena Raadha&#8217; and the swaras in two speeds found the violinist, Embar Kannan largely succeeding in his intention to reflect the vocalist&#8217;s style by harnessing hallmark phrases from the vidwan&#8217;s vocabulary.A Hindolam that endeared with its simplicity was the key to the heart of the Papanasam Sivam composition &#8216;Maa Ramanan. Remarkably, although the idiom was Carnatic, the sentient emotion melded North and South flavours into an organic entity as jarus linked and fused shuddha swaras with whorls. This organic unity was carried forward in the vocalist&#8217;s swara suffixes. But his finest was yet to come. The sheer breadth of the artiste&#8217;s vision revealed Sankarabharanam in all its pristine glory. Vidwat amassed over a lifetime manifested vista after vista, now spartan, now lush, now tranquil, now ebullient. This was pure music at its most inspirational, as dividing lines blurred and dissolved, sweeping alapana, kriti, niraval and kalpanaswara into the torrent that is ragapravaha. Musical expression transcended the formal framework of swaras to unite conception and articulation in a continuous stream of melodic expression.The majesty of the gandhara, the leisurely prayogas chiselled by insight at the panchama, the repose at the tara sthayi shadja, the diffused glow of tara sthayi prayogas &#8212; all these added to a memorable experience and the interpretation of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Enduku Peddala.&#8217;In melkala and kizhkala matrices of niraval and kalpanaswara and in the innumerable variations leading to the kuraippu at the gandhara, permutations found their mark with the ease of water finding its own level.No grandiose korvais, no mind-boggling kanakkus. Just unerring instinct to guide them home.Other inclusions were &#8216;Kaala Kaalan Kailai Naadhan&#8217; (Atana) and &#8216;Sharanam Ayyappa&#8217; (Mukhari). Embar Kannan&#8217;s attempts were in earnest but in Hindolam and Sankarabharanam his strings did not speak quite the same language that the main artiste did. Nevertheless, his essays were fluid and reflected discipline.Srimushnam Raja Rao&#8217;s mridangam playing made significant statements in kritis and rhythmic episodes. His tani avartanam with Udipi Sridhar&#8217;s sharp strokes on the ghatam commanded and coaxed in turns, the riot of changing colours in each nadai testifying to stunning expertise.That the siblings, saxophone artistes,M.S.Lavanya and M.S.Subbulakshmihave a loyal following was evidenced by a fair turnout of post-noon kutcheri regulars.One of the duo&#8217;s strong points is the treatment of kriti. Without taking the convenient way out by presenting a kriti as a compilation of sangatis strung together in approximation, emphasis was placed on the ideal of shadowing the vocal idiom as closely as possible. This was particularly evident in Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Pariyachakama&#8217; (Vanaspathi).Never an easy proposition to handle, and particularly demanding in the case of certain instruments, vivadhi scales need a tread-softly approach and a particular identification with that other-worldly element in their swaroopa, which clues the artiste in on which notes to oscillate and which to leave undisturbed. The sisters got it right in their rendition, with the plaintive gandhara continuing to haunt after the last notes had faded.In Mohanam, the limitations of the instrument hindered unfettered lyrical flights, but the raga&#8217;s joyous overtones overrode limitations. Considerable time devoted to the development of the madhya sthayi shadja-panchama suite, racy passages cascading from the rishabha and symmetrical ascent-descent leitmotifs were the melodic devices employed.Mysore Vasudevachar&#8217;s &#8216;Ra Ra Rajeevalochana&#8217; emerged with due respect for sahitya bhava. In Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Marugelara&#8217; (Jayantasri), one moment stood out in particular for capturing the spirit of the composition when the artistes dwelt on the tara sthayi shadja during &#8216;Enna Jaala Norula&#8217; in the charanam. Pantuvarali being the chosen raga for the RTP, the alapana was a fine effort that projected poignancy replete with shadja and panchama-varja prayogas enabled by agile fingering carried forward by the tanam.The pallavi in Adi 2-kalai with the eduppu at half  idam, was executed satisfactorily with trikalam and tisram followed by brief ragamalika swaras. Only, one wondered why the sisters had not opted for any of the ghana ragas for the main exposition, which would have lent the much-needed weight to the recital.In Anayampatti G. Venkatasubramaniam, you recognised a violinist with potential who rendered a Pantuvarali alapana that was striking in parts and an effective tanam. His raga delineations would benefit from better structuring and wholesome melodic statements rather than a dependency on scale-based patterns.M.R.Sainath (mridangam) and N.H.P.Raja Rajan (ghatam) were subdued during kriti support, but turned high-decibel during the pallavi swaras and ragamalika, drowning out the saxophones&#8217; statements. A welcome feature at the concert was the hovering presence of the sound engineer who monitored audio levels at regular intervals - unobtrusively.
