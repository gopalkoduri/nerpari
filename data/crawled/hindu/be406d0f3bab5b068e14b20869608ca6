VTrichur V. Ramachandran presented a scintillating vocal concert as part of the Eppadi Paadinaro programme jointly organised by the Rasika Ranjana Sabha and the Sri Krishna Sweets at the sabha's FGN Hall in Tiruchi recently. This was the last concert of the monthly music programme for this year. Ramachandran, accompanied by M. A. Sundareswaran on the violin and Umayalpuram Mali on the mridangam, in his reverberating voice, began with a mellow &#8216;Ritigowla (&#8216;Thathva Mariya'). He then moved to Bageswari (&#8216;Mighu Lahu') and enthralled the audience with Panthuvarali (&#8216;Sajama Rama'). His extensive delineation of Thodi (&#8216;Karthikeya') rendered with aplomb, with swaras and sargams, established his expertise in the craft. His rendition of Bahudari (&#8216;Unnadiyo'), Dwijavanti'(&#8216;Ahilandeswari') and Atana (&#8216;Indhu') were lilting. He concluded with a Hindustani bhajan (&#8216;Gopala') in Bilawal.The violin support from Sundareswaran, who belongs to the Parur bani, was classic and he captivated listeners with his splendid fingering prowess.His fast Thodi will be remembered for long. The percussion support of Mali was superb and his commanding thani deserves special mention.
