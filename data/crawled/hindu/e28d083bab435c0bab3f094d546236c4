VAbhishek Raghuram, grandson of the late Palghat R. Raghu, is perhaps one among the  most promising  of the young crop of Carnatic vocalists. His musical acumen clearly bears the stamp of his rich lineage.He began his concert in Kochi with a varnam in Naayaki raga. He then set the tempo for what was to follow with a flowing rendering of &#8216;Thyagarajagurum aasraye&#8230;,&#8217; a M. D. Ramanathan kriti in Kedara raga. The concert went into full throttle, with a precise exposition of Suddha Dhanyasi raga.Abhishek chose the Swati Tirunal kriti &#8216;Saamodam&#8230;&#8217; His traditional style of raga alapana was an indication of his intense saadhakam.Abhishek&#8217;s approach to ragas, at times, veered from the regular, thus ushering in a refreshing originality. This was evident when he sang Vasantha Bhairavi, Naasika Bhooshani and Kaapi Narayani.He chose the Tyagaraja krithis &#8216;Nee Daya Radha&#8230;,&#8217; &#8216;Maaravairi&#8230;&#8217; and &#8216;Sarasaamadana&#8230;&#8217; respectively to evoke the mood and texture of the ragas. They all had pronounced shades of the Hindustani style, especially when he went into a detailed exploration of the ragas.Singing one after another in quick succession, Abhishek was at his best in his treatment of Keeravani. The Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Kalikiyude&#8230;&#8217; was brilliantly rendered.  This was certainly the best phase of the concert. The swara showers were smooth and delightful. There was a spontaneous flow in his rendition of the niraval, not for a moment breaking the tempo he had set.Thiruvizha Biju S. Anand&#8217;s violin came out gently, sedately complementing the energetic, full-throated singing of Abhishek.Another highpoint of the concert was the percussion back-up provided by Mannargudi A. Easwaran. He virtually controlled the concert, following it up with a crisp thaniavarthanam. Payyannur Govindaprasad on the morsing did a commendable job. Abhishek rounded off the delightful concert with another Swati krithi &#8216;Kanthanodu&#8230;,&#8217; in pleasing Neelaambari and a Thiruppugazh.
