VMany artistes are talented and work silently for the cause of classical music. However, they seldom manage to get due attention from organisers, rasikas and others. DD Classical Music Club in an endeavour to bring to the fore such artistes organised a Carnatic vocal concert of Salem Gayathri Venkatesan in the Capital recently. The concert was organised in collaboration with the India International Centre in the latter&#8217;s auditorium.Though the time slot given to this talented artiste was less than an hour, she put up an impressive show within this time. The concert was preceded by a talk by Radha Venkatachalam. Ironically, her talk centred on reduced time schedule of present-day concerts, which she said, hampers the creativity of the artistes and affects the quality of the concert, as well.Gayathri began her concert with Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Vathapi Ganapatim&#8221; in the raga Hamsadhwani. Even for this opening piece, she prefixed a brief sketch of the raga, which seemed unnecessary, given her time limit. At the most, a flash of this raga in a few seconds could have served the purpose. The swaraprastaras that she presented towards the end of the song were lively.Gayathri had to immediately proceed to present the main item of her recital, which was Mysore Vasudevacharya&#8217;s &#8220;Bhajanaseyara&#8221; in the raga Dharmavati.Apart from bringing out the raga bhava embedded in this composition,  she also presented a scintillating alap of this raga.  She also displayed her creative talents through niraval and swaraprastaras that she presented towards the end.Pakkala Ramados on the violin, J. Vaidhyanathan on the mridangam and Trichy Murali on the ghatam provided elegant support to Gayathri.  Those who  missed this concert  could watch out for  the telecast by Doordarshan in the first week of September.Elsewhere, at a concert organised by Gayathri Fine Arts as part of their Annual Day Music Concerts, youngster Vilasini Krishnan from Chennai also put up an impressive performance. After the starting  Saveri raga varnam in Adi tala, which she presented in two speeds, Vilasini presented a lively &#8220;Gananathane Gunabodane&#8221; in the raga Saranga. For this composition of Periyasami Thooran, she suffixed kalpana swaras in fast tempo, which suited the proceedings.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Sangetha Gnanamu&#8221; in the raga Dhanyasi and Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Ranganayakam&#8221; in the raga Nayaki were well presented, emphasising  the sahitya bhava. Kotteswara Iyer&#8217;s &#8220;Arul shaiya vendum&#8221;, a slightly fast tempo composition in the raga Rasikapriya was emotive.As the main item she presented yet another composition of Tyagaraja, &#8220;Mohana Rama&#8221; in the raga Mohanam. This contained a fine alap, which she delineated in stages, and creative swara formats. Delhi&#8217;s R. Sridhar on the violin, Kumbakonam Padmanabhan on the mridangam and Mannai N. Kannan on the ghatam provided good support. Sridhar should avoid harsh notes, which he brought out many a time. While Padmanabhan&#8217;s support was a little noisy and he seemed to be straining himself, Kannan was subdued throughout.Earlier, as part of the annual concerts, Delhi&#8217;s Divya Rajan, recipient of a scholarship from Gayathri Fine Arts for advanced training in  music, was featured in a brief concert of an hour.Such efforts of the organisation aimed at promoting  Carnatic music are laudable.
