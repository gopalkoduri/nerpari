VIt is the charge of the young brigade. From August 5 to 10, hundreds of sangita sishyas will attend, participate and organise a music festival of, by and for them. Titled &#8216;Svanubhava,&#8217; it will let wannabe musicians express, imbibe and share.Mooted by Matrka and co-hosted by YACM (Youth Association for Classical Music), Music Academy Music College, Government Music College and Kalakshetra, the festival is part of Matrka&#8217;s efforts to find new ways to create a bond among performers, learners and listeners.Well-known vocalists T.M. Krishna and Bombay Jayashree, who set up Matrka, think a community of up-and-coming musicians is a must to allow them to discuss, debate and most importantly, celebrate music. &#8220;We may be solo performers, but off-stage it&#8217;s nice to be part of a like-minded group. It&#8217;s not just to know your contemporaries, it also adds to your vidwat,&#8221; says Jayashree.It was a concert at YACM during her initial years in Chennai that made her realise this. &#8220;It was amazing to see one young musician fix the mike, the other welcome guests, yet another bring in water&#8230;For someone from Mumbai, to see this kind of bonhomie among young artists was comforting. Eventually, I became a member of YACM and thoroughly enjoyed partaking in its activities and meeting master musicians.&#8221; The duo wanted to rope in YACM more for sentimental reasons. &#8220;We have such fond memories and rich experiences,&#8221; they chorus.The idea for an exclusive student festival is inspired by their YACM stint.Says Krishna, &#8220;We need to look beyond the class room. Unlike in other fields of study, in music you cannot afford to focus on just one aspect. Students from different institutions or learning from different gurus should meet, get familiar with other art forms, attend lecture-demonstrations and workshops and interact with senior artists. This could push many to pursue the art more vigorously. We experienced it at YACM. It was a friendly and informal atmosphere out there. We would discuss music, listen to great masters speak or sing and get our doubts clarified. It made learning fun.&#8221;Continues Krishna, &#8220;One may or may not be a successful performer. Some students may take to teaching, a few others could turn organisers or become writers. That&#8217;s fine. At least, there&#8217;s the satisfaction of creating more and more discerning ears.&#8221;Jayashree  and Krishna came up with the concept of such a festival in the beginning of this year and approached the heads of the three institutions. &#8220;What&#8217;s heartening is all of them immediately took to it. We wanted the students, in consultation with their teachers, to conceive the festival in their own way. Believe me they came with not less than 500 ideas. It showed their understanding of the art. They knew clearly which concept would suit which artist and how it should be implemented. We just assured them our support and wanted the students to enjoy complete freedom and control,&#8221; says Krishna.The members of the YACM have been coordinating with the three committees (comprising 15 members each) set up in the three institutions for this festival that will be held from August 5 to 10 at Kalakshetra, Government Music College and the Music Academy.On all the five days (9 a.m. to 3.30 p.m.), there will be concerts by senior musicians and students, lec-dems, question-answer and chat sessions, photo galleries, screening of documentaries on legendary artists, powerpoint presentations, and good food too.&#8220;Besides, students and faculty from the three institutions, those who run, and learn at private music schools will also participate. There are some coming from outstation too. Surprisingly, we have been getting emails asking if we could have such festivals in other cities. If students come forward with more such events, they can always count on our support,&#8221; smiles Jayashree.What they feelA unique festival, it will focus on just the students; exposing them to various aspects of music and facilitating exchange with students and teachers from institutions.PakirisamyPrinicipal, Government Music CollegeIt&#8217;s like a six-day crash course for students of music. An amazing platform that offers the freedom to ask questions and voice views. It&#8217;s been a learning experience to help organising this festival with so many other youngsters like me in the field. If the festival is a success, we hope to make it an annual event.Ritwik RajaPresident, YACMStudents generally don&#8217;t attend ticketed concerts. So it&#8217;s nice to have kutcheris and workshops specially for them. It will provide valuable inputs to make them better performers and listeners.M.
