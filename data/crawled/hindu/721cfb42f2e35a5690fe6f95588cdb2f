VGeetha Bennet&#8217;s  veena concert was featured at Rasika Ranjana Sabha, Tiruchi.With a perfect tonal quality of her instrument, she commenced with Kalyani varnam set to adi talam followed by &#8216;Sarasa Saamadana&#8217; in Kapi Narayani.While Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Pariyaachakama&#8217; in Vanaspathi set to rupakam and Swathi Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Smarajanaka&#8217; in Behag set to misrachapu sounded excellent on the instrument, &#8216;Raguvamsa Sudha&#8217; of Patnam Subramania Iyer was a real treat to the spellbound audience.To intensify the mood of the audience she started singing and playing in unison, &#8216;Paadimathi Nadhi&#8217; - Tiruppugazh Virutham in Kedara Gowla, Dhanyasi and Sivaranjani. The much expected &#8216;Vaa Velavaa&#8217; in Sivaranjani, the composition of her Guru and father  S. Ramanathan, was  brisk and graceful and proved that her expert fingers could easily play  any note  with unbelievable perfection.Balanced with multiple segments of soft and subtle rhythmic layers Koviladi R. Madhwaprasad on the mridangam and Tiruverumbur Krishna on the ghatam displayed scholarship and their  tani avartanam was  enjoyable.After playing Annamacharya&#8217;s &#8216;Bhavayami&#8217; set to kanda chapu, she concluded the recital with the Tiruppugazh, &#8216;Thamarumamaru.&#8217;SYED MUTHAHAR SAQAF
