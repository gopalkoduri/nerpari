VYoungsters these days manage more than one vocation and they do it with &#233;lan.  An Aerospace Engineer from IIT-M, working for Jet Airways, Rahul Narayan&#8217;s approach to Carnatic music showed professional maturity. The main raga Madhyamavati unfolded fascinatingly; thanks to the credentials of good training under a popular guru like T.R. Balamani and his commendable understanding of the presentation technique. Rahul&#8217;s perspective of Madhyamavati was lucid and he adopted the right speed with the necessary stopovers of repose and roll-ons. His robust voice has heavy masculine tenor with the right touch of magnetism.&#8216;Rama katha sudha&#8217; of Tyagaraja was rendered in an unhurried manner but had to move in rapidity in the second speed swaras at &#8216;Bama mani janaki sowmitri.&#8217; Though enjoyable, a more concerted effort in designing the swara lines would have elevated Rahul&#8217;s exercise to higher levels in this part.In the earlier segment of his concert also it could be noted that Rahul steered away from fast rendition of the kritis. Nevertheless, if he could accelerate in &#8216;Sobillu sapathaswara&#8217; (Janganmohini) in a pleasant manner, he could have given similar treatments to the opening pada varnam of Lalgudi Jayaraman in Neelambari (&#8216;Senthil mevum&#8217;), the beautiful composition of Tyagaraja in Nattai (&#8216;Ninne bhajana&#8217; with its alluring chittaswaram). Narayan&#8217;s wisdom was evident in his essay of Rishabapriya. He neatly punctuated his alapana with the right kind of speed and suppleness. The voice was fully exploited in reaching the notes appropriately leaving no room for diffidence. &#8216;Gana naya desika&#8217; of Koteeswara Iyer and the swarakalpana were skillfully done at &#8216;Sapthaswara sangita&#8217;.Arunachala Karthik on the violin exhibited good vibe with the singer. His versions of Nattai, Rishabapriya and Madhyamavati showed his flair for striking the best rapport with the vocalist&#8217;s vision. Guru Raghavendran and Madras J Ramdas on the mridangam and ghatam made their contribution in the right order.
