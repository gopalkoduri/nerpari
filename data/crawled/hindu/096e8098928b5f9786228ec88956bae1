VIt is often said that classical music concert gains momentum as time ticks by if the artiste is of an excellent calibre.Well, it is not hyperbolic to state that Shailesh Bhagwat is more than a top-class instrumentalist and hisshehnairecital could keep the audience glued to their seats on a mid-summer noon!The viewers sat mesmerised to the tunes ofBhairavandBhilawal, oblivious of the surroundings.After all, he is none other than Ustad Bismillah Khan's foremost pupil and that  were evident right from the word go.In keeping with the convention, the maestro  opened his recital with the ceremoniousBhairav.Theshehnaibeing a natty instrument  made for an aesthetic appeal too in Bhagwat's dexterous playing. The soulfulBhairavwound its way through the nuances of its framework reaching great heights as it gained impetus with the artiste's  technical display.Emotive elementBhagwat's style is uniformly soothing, soft and  flows smoothly with the emotive element dominating the raga, which is a rarity in Hindustani music (since form and not content is the basic criteria).Be it theBhairav, Bhilawalor theDesi(all with theShadj pancham bhav), thethumrior theGoonzuti shehnai, Bhagwat could impart a sweetness to the raga that seemed to come straight from  his heart.He regaled the audience with athumriand on request took up a popular piece of theGoonj uti shehnaiwhich  seemed to reverberate through the air, drowning one and all in its melodic charm.Theshehnaino longer seemed a wind instrument being blown into a tune, it seemed to have been bestowed with the gift of speech.The song looked less played than sung and that too with a clarity that is difficult to envisage.Pathetic acousticsThe Sunday morning recital was Shailesh Bhagwat's magic melody that echoed in everybody's ears long after it was over. Ustad Javed on the tabla was rhythmic perfection,  while Vikas Pardesi on the harmonium was  inaudible at times.The acoustics were going for a toss now and then in the open hall, which  should be the last place to hold a classical instrumental concert. Mahua Mukherjee gave a vocal recital in the short break  with the wind-instrument.  She took upBhilaskhaniThodi(Aakiyan bhar aaye) lacing it with beautifulbhol tansandakaar tans.The timbre and reach of her sonorous voice was admirable. Though a budding artiste, she  wound through the tough techniques of the raaga with confidence, unveiling the fine distinctions with seasoned familiarity. She made the break a welcome affair.The programme was organised by Surmandal at Pingali Venkatram Reddy Hall, Hyderabad.Ranee KumarBottom Template Starts
