VWomen in Indonesia sing a folk tune even as they keep rhythm on their steel water pots. Their music seamlessly blends with the melodic strains of Raga Natabhairavi heard on the veena. A raga alapana by Anuradha Vishwanathan makes way for Tamil songs \u000aby Sufi singers from Nagore. Padma Shankar&#8217;s violin strains meld smoothly with French bass guitarist Mishko M&#8217;Ba. Young Buddhist monks from the Namdroling Monastery, Kushalnagar, Karnataka, blow their longhorn (dung chen) share stage space with Israeli drummer Yoav Bunzel. Once again, the violin, flute, bass guitar, drums, keyboard, tabla and mridangam join in. New music  emerges.That&#8217;s the pulse of the film/album Laya Project, the flagship of EarthSync, the world music label that operates from Chennai. Enough has been written about how the label was an offshoot of the Laya Project, a tribute to the 2004 tsunami survivors. But it is worth refreshing the memory.Untapped talentA group of music lovers travelled to various countries affected by the tsunami.During their sojourn, they discovered and recorded never-heard-before music and its practitioners, mostly fisherfolk. &#8220;When we saw the abundance of untapped talent in all the countries we visited &#8211; Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Maldives, Myanmar, Sri Lanka &#8211; we felt the need for a platform to promote that music. Most important, the Laya Project is a celebration of the triumph of the human spirit,&#8221; says Shirley Abraham, Corporate Communications, EarthSync. The film won international awards and has been shown at several festivals.It was following extensive research that the team from EarthSync zeroed in on some rare forms of music from South East Asia, such as the choral didong songs of the Gayo in Aceh, Indonesia. Here 12 men sit in a circle and use their hands and a pillow to keep rhythm.The live version of the Laya Project, which performed at the Alliance Francaise this past weekend, was truly a melting pot of cultures.The Laya Project Live band (if you can call the 20-odd members a band) has performed extensively in India and Israel. And now, the troupe is all set to rock Australia, where it is the opening act at the Perth International Film Festival to be held in February 2009.&#8220;The Alliance Francaise concerts are in a way a warm-up to Perth,&#8221; says composer-arranger Patrick Sebag. This Israeli keyboard player, who &#8220;grew up on Bob Dylan&#8221; and enjoys Radiohead as much as he does Bombay Jayashree, &#8220;just allowed the various musical genres to flow together. I was there from the beginning of the project and part of the team that went on a musical mission. It was a journey of pain and discovery&#8230; pain to see so many people suffer and discover that in spite of the tragedy, they were so happy and cheerful.&#8221;For the Sufi singers from Nagore, (near Nagapattinam, where the famous dargah of Meeran Sahib Abdul Qadir Shahul Hamid Badshah is located), being on this project has been an &#8220;unforgettable experience.&#8221;Abdul Gani, Saburmaideen and Haja Bawa, whose songs are a combination of Urdu, Farsi and Tamil, say, &#8220;We have very happy that our style of singing is getting so much attention.&#8221;The youngest member of the team is 19-year-old Saminathan from Mettupalayam. His eyes sparkle as he talks about Tudumbattam (where steel drums are used), his family tradition. &#8220;It is a moment of pride that Tudumbattam is going places. When I got a chance to teach this art form to children at Dakshinachitra, I knew I had achieved something.&#8221;For the three Buddhist monks, Shen Phen, Lodoe and Jamyng, who are not too comfortable with either English or Hindi, it was &#8220;a bit difficult initially. But now we are happy.&#8221; In fact, one of them is now learning Tamil.As you watch the artists, who communicate through the language of music, you are forced to use the much used clich&#233; &#8212; that art transcends religion, culture and language.
