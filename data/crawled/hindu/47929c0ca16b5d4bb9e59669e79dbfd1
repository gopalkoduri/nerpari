VSumitra Nitin&#8217;s vocal concert recently held in Bangalore was part of a two-day music festival organised by Neelambari, an association of students of Neela Ramgopal, to celebrate the birth centenary of the late G.N. Balasubramaniam. She was acco\u000ampanied by Jyothsna Manjunath (violin), and Renukaprasad (mridanga).The performance, consisting entirely of GNB&#8217;s compositions, began with the Andolika raga varna &#8220;Nee dayarada&#8221; set to adi thala. &#8220;Karimukha varada&#8221; in Natta was sung at a mellow pace and embellished with a few avarthanas of kalpana swaras. &#8220;Dashashathadala sarojasane&#8221; in Hamsanadam, composed with the vakra usage of the dhaivatha in the avarohana, was followed by a soft, unhurried alapana of Yadukula Kamboji, suffused with raga bhava and illumining the subtle shades of pivotal notes such as the dhaivatha, with a continued affirmation of the raga identity in the kalpana swaras that were appended to &#8220;Parama kripasagari&#8221; in rupaka thala.The perennial favourite &#8220;Saraswathi namosthuthe&#8221; in Saraswathi raga and rupaka thala was the swift precursor to an expansive elaboration of Thodi. Scrupulous adherence to tradition, merged with ample powers of improvisation in the gradual progression of the alapana, with the strength and lucidity of voice at the thara sthayi madhyama and panchama, the fleeting use of plain notes, and the fine touches during the final descent were particularly noteworthy. &#8220;Mama kuleshwaram shastharam&#8221;, a grand krithi in thisra jathi eka thala was rendered with a meticulously structured neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Shamitha nathajana duritham&#8221;, with tuneful support from the violinist and followed by an impressive thani avarthana.&#8220;Pada bhajana&#8221; in Khamas and a thillana in Hamsanandi brought the concert, which showcased a few fine works by a master composer, to a close. Crystal clear and precise articulation of the lyrics, indicative of rare dedication and application, was definitely one of the highlights of the performance.
