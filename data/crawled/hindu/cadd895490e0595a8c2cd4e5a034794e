VM. RAMESHOne glance at the stage, and you will know that Bhavana Viswanathan means business. No acknowledgement of a known face in the audience, not even an ocular communication with the accompanists. Eyes closed and intensely serious, it is obvious she's keen to ensure that there is no digression  in her music's conformity to grammar.Listen to Bhavana's `Maarubalka,' and you will know where she is from &#151;  the Semmangudi School. Sriranjani, however, was not the central piece of Bhavana's concert for the Music Academy on Sunday last, but was definitely its highlight, although most of the post-concert encomiums from the rasikas touched on Panthuvarali (`Sarasaksha') and Ananda Bhairavi (Marivere).Pleasing renditionThe Panthuvarali was pleasingly rendered, but it will get only the silver; the gold goes to Sriranjani. You could see Semmangudi mama's stamp in every note of both the alapana and the swaras. Thoroughly enjoyable. Looks like this disciple of Semmangudi's student, V. Subrahmaniam, will add to the growing portfolio of Semmangudi School stars of Carnatic music.The main piece of the concert was Thodi. `Gajavadhana' of Kumara Ettendra was the song chosen, another kriti associated with Semmangudi.It was a no-frills alapana, manodharma-based, neatly rendered except perhaps in the upper reaches where Bhavana's voice appeared to be a little strained and, unlike in the previous alapanas, the notes came out as a scream.Neraval and swaras were taken up at the anupallavi point, `Vijayollasa Valli Kataaksha Paatra.'Poorna Vaidyanathan on the violin and M.S.Varadan on the mridangam gave adequate support.Bottom Template Starts
