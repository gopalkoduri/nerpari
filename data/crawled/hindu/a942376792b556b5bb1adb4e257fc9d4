VJ. R. SHRIDHARANMusic was at its pristine splendour in Vijayawada last weekend. Fr. Devaiah Auditorium at Andhra Loyola College reverberated with measured claps and wild cheers as the talented Chennai-based musicians of Raaga Priya, headed by director Comagan, enthralled the denizens with their poignant rendition. Under the veil of a cultural programme, the determined musicians sent a message to the society that they need more opportunities to live a life with self-esteem and not sympathy (all the musicians are visually challenged).Comagan and Palaniswamy rendered the popular songsOmkaara NaadaaluandSankaraa Naada Sareeraa...from filmSankaraabharanamwith ease. Unlike the present-day musicians, who depend on notations and scripts while singing and playing instruments, these gifted musicians &#151;  blessed with immense memory power and intuition &#151;  moved on like a well-oiled machine without any hitch. The synchronisation ofragamandtalamwas perfect, bringing to fore their hours of unbridled practice. Comagan was good with his impressive compeering.When the much-awaited songMounamgaane Edagamaneefrom filmNa Autograph... Sweet Memorieswas rendered, the  audience were thrilled  and when Comagan crooned the touchlines  -Maa Dhairyaanni Harshinshi..., many eyes turned misty. Incidentally, Raaga Priya shot into fame with this song from the filmNa Autographmade both in Tamil and Telugu. Founded in 1992, the troupe has performed over 150 programmes all over the country.Comagan also sang his favourite numberMere Sapnonki Ranee Kab....from filmAaradhna. Peppy songs likeEe Petaku Nene MasthrifromMutha Maistri,Devuda DevudafromChandramukhikept the younger audience engrossed.Bottom Template Starts
