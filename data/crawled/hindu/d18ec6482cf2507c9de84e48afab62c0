VSudha Raghunathan's performances always have a distinctive flair for showiness to which her vocal faculty is deployed. She is adept at the picturisation of a raga with twists and turns in the speed track.  These characteristic features came to the fore in her performance for Hamsadhwani, where she rendered Tamil compositions under `Eppadi Paadinaro...'Sound vidwatThe  alapana of Sriranjani (Matha Innum Vaadha) was vast in range, more assertive than delicate in expression.  Sudha's vidwat was sound, tonal control excellent, leading to a profusion of Sriranjani sancharas raining from the tara sthayi, intensely vigorous but rarely dainty.Glitzy stimulation was the decisive factor in the unfolding of the songs, "Karpaga Vinayaka" (Hamsadhwani), "Aazhi Mazhai Kanna" (Varali) and "Eppadi Paadinaro" (Karnataka Devagandhari/Abheri). B. Raghavendra Rao on the violin provided accompaniment with great modesty and restraint. Tiruvarur Vaidyanathan (mridangam) played in an impulsively energetic style. R. Raman (morsing) chimed with Vaidyanathan.SVKBottom Template Starts
