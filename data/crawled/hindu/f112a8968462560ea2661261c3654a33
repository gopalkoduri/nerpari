Va Major portion of the concert was dedicated to Lord Vishnu.Delhiites should be grateful to Vishnu Sahasranama Sat Sangam, R.K. Puram, and the Sankara Vidya Kendra for organising an excellent music performance of devotional songs by Mahati Sreekumar here the other day.The spirit of the muses entered into the artiste right from the beginning. &#8220;Mahaganapatim&#8221; of Muthuswami Dikshitar set the tempo of the recital.  Thereafter the major portion of the performance was dedicated to Lord Vishnu.&#8220;Nan Enna Thavam Seitheno&#8221; in Kamas, &#8220;Nan Oru Vilayattu Bommaiya&#8221; of Uthukadu Venkatesa Diskhitar in raga Navarasa Kannada, &#8220;Narajanma Bhandaka&#8221; and &#8220;Alaipayuthe&#8221; in Kanada reiterated concept of the soul, jivatma, yearning  to reach Paramatma, the Divine.She took up Shubhapantuvarali raga for elaborate treatment, introducing the raga with a long alapana and concentrating on all aspects of the composition. The niraval (rhythmic improvisation of lyrics) and kalpana swaras (note patterns)  with kuraippu (rhythmic flourishes that bring the patterns to a close) in half avartanas were indeed remarkable.&#8220;Kurai Onrum Illai&#8221; of Rajaji was the finale of the first portion of songs on Lord Vishnu. The later portion of the programme was devoted to songs on  the Goddess and compositions of poets Subramania Bharati and Gopalakrishna Bharati. The ragamalika piece &#8220;Aarabhimanam&#8221; was nicely rendered. &#8220;Chinnanchiru Kiliye&#8221; and &#8220;Eppovaruvaro&#8221; were sung with intense feeling. Mahati is a child prodigy. Her father Thiruvaiyaru P. Sekar is a disciple of the maestro M. Balamuralikrishna. Her mother, Vasanthi, is a flautist and disciple of T.R. Mahalingam and N. Ramani.A few words about the accompanying artistes.  VSK Chakrapani, violinist, is a scion of the great Rajamanickam Pillai. The effect of long bowing technique can be felt in Chakrapani&#8217;s performance.  He is an institution by himself and not an individual. He has  many worthy disciples.Kumbakonam Padmanabhan, disciple of Thiruvarur Bhaktavatsalam, has imbibed the best from his guru. With every performance he is getting chiseled like  a cut diamond. His tani avartanam was unique. Ramamurthy  on the ghatam  gave excellent support to the mridangist.
