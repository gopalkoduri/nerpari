VBangalore School of Music certainly keeps the local music scene alive; if they don&#8217;t have visiting musicians, they call upon local musicians to entertain us. This not only contributes to the organisation&#8217;s coffers, it fulfils the importan\u000at functions of building up amateur musicians&#8217; confidence, simultaneously bringing them to public attention.Young Maestros in Concert was held at the Alliance Francaise recently. Neville Barucha is familiar to Bangalore&#8217;s concert goers: we have seen him grow as a pianist and now at 17, he is a mature young man, no longer the boy who performed a few years ago.He introduced his pieces with nuggets of information that showed his wider interest in music, often demonstrating a point at the keyboard. Starting with four Scalatti Sonatas, his technique was equal to their demands, establishing tone colours with the requisite Spanish dance rhythms that are the foundation of the composer&#8217;s sound.Spanish rhythm, with its strong percussive solo accents also marked Albeniz&#8217; Sevilla in C, but in the other pieces one felt that Neville was a trifle overly ambitious. The overreach was most evident when the pace was frenetic, as in the last Mozart Variation, or the fiendish cross-rhythms in Chopin&#8217;s Fantasie Impromptu. Though Neville&#8217;s mastery is very impressive, showing great improvement and growth as a performer, perhaps he should not tackle such difficulties as yet. What bodes well is that such a young person has such a feel for the romanticism of Chopin or the poetic sweeps of Ponchielli, though his technique could not match their demands. He was therefore best in Scarlatti&#8217;s four sonatas.The other half of the evening&#8217;s Duo was young violinist Jan Brouwer, a new talent to this reviewer, though he is no stranger to the concert platform. His repertoire concentrated on romantic pieces, with strong melody lines, often soulful, such as Schumann&#8217;s first Fantasiestuecke, and short pieces by Faure &amp; Kreisler. They were not among the most technically challenging; even Handel&#8217;s Adagio from Sonata in F, was tuneful rather than taut with baroque contrapuntalism.As he played six such pieces without a break, one felt the need for a change of tempo and mood, though his feeling for the music is not in doubt.His exceptionally long slender fingers are capable of prodigious stretches so that he should tackle more intricate passagework; in future, one hopes he will treat us, for example, to one of Bach&#8217;s solo violin sonatas.Piano accompaniment calls for a similarity of approach to the music, rapport and well-honed execution with the instrument or singer/choir. It is a different experience from solo performance and the interaction is good discipline for both soloist and accompanist.Supporting Jan in the simpler piano accompaniments saw another new talent: Natasha Andrade was quietly competent, letting the violin soar over the gentle flow of the keyboard.Neville tackled the more difficult pieces, where the piano played not merely a supportive role but often took up the musical strains. As an accompanist, Neville needs to tone down his contribution; he often overpowered the violin, particularly in pizzicato passages.Due to its large component of tuneful romantic pieces, the evening proved very popular &#8211; though that is not to take away from the pleasure of seeing young talent burgeon.
