VThe contrast in bowing and fingering techniques adopted for the swara and sahitya passages, in the Gowla composition &#8216;Dudukugala &#8217; stands testimony to this fact.Among the many compositions in Mohanam that the violinist has played, the Misra chapu creation of Tyagaraja &#8216;Mati Matiki,&#8217; seems to be his favourite. Certain ragas in the Carnatic system need to be briefly presented during alapanas, as overdoing the vinyasa for these ragas may fatigue the listeners. The professional, that Lalgudi is, he makes his essay of Natakapriya to the point and he diligently winds up the same with the rasika longing for more.  N.C.Krishnamacharyalu&#8217;s composition &#8216;Marajananim&#8217; with an interesting chittaswara is gripping. Out of the few available compositions in Natakapriya, this song stands out.The majestic portion of this concert is the Bhairavi suite that comprises  Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s magnum opus &#8216;Balagopala,&#8217; preceding which is an exquisite display of Bhairavi on a huge canvas.  &#8216;Balagopala&#8217; is a summary of the Bhagavatham and the manner in which the bowing of the artiste is vigorous while playing for the sahitya portion &#8216;Drona Karna Duryodhanadi Hara&#8217; and mild and gentle for the lyrics &#8216;Draupadi Mana Samrakshana&#8217; speak of his genius and his sincerity in approaching a composition.This album is a must for the numerous fans of Lalgudi Jayaraman.PVK
