VThe ongoing Delhi International Arts Festival (DIAF) presented some of the topmost Hindustani and Carnatic musicians under their segment of Indian Classical Music at the Sai Auditorium.The fare opened with the legends &#8211; Ustad Asad Ali Khan on his rudra veena and Ustad Fahimuddin Dagar with his awesome vocal rendition of dhrupad. N. Rajam and Pandit Rajan-Sajan Mishra were the other attractions of instrumental and vocal Hindustani classical music.N. Rajam has imbibed the spiritual quality of her legendary guru Pandit Omkar Nath Thakur&#8217;s music in full measure. Listening to her sonorous violin one is reminded of the soulful singing of the late Pandit Omkarnath with its characteristic &#8216;pukaar&#8217; and the refined tonal variations. She opened her concert with the sombre evening raga Yaman.The initial aalap and the slow composition set to vilambit ektala, dealt the melodious raga in great detail following the gaayaki ang. The gradual progression of the swaras during the aalap barhat delineated the raga&#8217;s nuances sensitively. The crisp taan patterns were crystal clear where each and every note glowed individually. The tihayees were measured with accurate precision.The medium tempo teentala composition was the popular chhota khayal of Yaman &#8220;Piya ki nazariya jaadu bhari&#8230;&#8221;, played with all its magic.The violin kept singing this bandish with amazing longing until Rajam switched over to tantrakaari ang with a faster composition that culminated in super fast jhaala and showcased her instrumental technique with much aplomb. After the main raga she played a bandishi thumari in raga Des and a Banarasi dadra in raga Khamaj before concluding with Bhairavi.Akram Khan&#8217;s accompanying tabla matched the musicality of the melodious violin. The thunderous applause echoed with requests for more, so she had to play &#8220;Vaishnav Jana&#8230;&#8221; even after the conventional end with Bhairavi.Pandit Rajan-Sajan Mishra gave an impressive vocal recital on the concluding day of the classical music festival. They chose raga Yaman-Kalyan to begin with and presented three compositions in slow, medium and fast tempos respectively. The bara khayal set to slow ektala saw them exploring the raga with detailed aalap and bol-aalap even in the mandra saptak (base octave) around the mandra shadja, at ease. The delicate touches of shuddha madhyam enhanced the beauty of the raga, differentiating it from plain and simple Yaman. The popular chhota khayal &#8220;Aiso sundar sugharawa baalamuva&#8230;&#8221; was adorned with varied aakar and sargam taans.Then they presented a scintillating tappa in raga Khamaj. Even the preceding aalap to create the atmosphere of the raga paved the path of this intricate genre invented by the legendary Shori Miyaan of Punjab. One could guess by merely listening to the intricacies of aalap that they were going to render a tappa. This particular tappa-Khamaj was a composition of Shori Miyaan set to addha theka with a forceful &#8216;sam&#8217; that came with an exciting flourish. The singing duo enjoyed this challenging item as much as the awestruck audience did.Pandit Dharmnath Mishra who had come all the way from Lucknow to accompany them on harmonium did full justice. Sukhmoy Banerjee gave them support on tabla and Ritesh-Rajneesh on taanpura. Pandit Rajan-Sajan Mishra concluded their vocal jugalbandi with a bhajan and complemented each other till the end in the most desired way.
