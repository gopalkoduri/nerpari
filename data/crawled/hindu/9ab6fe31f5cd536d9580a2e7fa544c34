VSursagar, Bangalore, music festival featured two of India&#8217;s most renowned, Calcutta based young maestros sitar virtuoso Purbayan Chatterjee and the young talented vocalist Kaushiki Chakraborthy Desikan. Both the artistes re-established their cr\u000aedentials as performers par excellence amidst thunderous applause from the audience who attended these concerts in large numbers.Purbayan Chatterjee has been hailed as a prodigy and has several prestigious concerts at the national and international circuits to his credit. A practitioner of the Senia &#8211; Maihar Gharana, Purbayan has been groomed by stalwarts like Pt. Nikhil Banerjee and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. He commenced his recital with the beautiful twilight melody raga Purya Dhanashree, a popular raga, often heard in evening mehfils. It was truly a daunting task to present this raga which has almost been exploited to its fullest potential by several luminaries and young Purbayan handled this challenge with relish and felicity. It was a refreshingly different Purya Dhanasree that he attempted to present in his traditional, prefatory alap-jod-jhala in the &#8220;anibaddh&#8221; mode before his rendition in the &#8216;vilambit gat&#8217;. The Drut teental composition, &#8220;Payaliya Jhankar Mori&#8221;, an immensely popular bandish in this raga elicited many an ecstatic &#8216;wah! wah!&#8217; from the listeners.Purbayan also surprised the audience with his impeccable delineation of the chota khayal in Rag Bihag as he chose alternately to sing and play the bandish &#8220;Aliri albeli jiya ko lubhaye&#8221; and demonstrated his vocal talent.Kaushiki Chakraborty Desikan, the daughter and disciple of the illustrious vocalist Pt. Ajay Chakraborty, presented &#8220;thumri Gayan&#8221;. The thumri concert was a testimony to the versatility of young Kaushiki&#8217;s creative genius who is undoubtedly one of the leading practitioners of khyal music.  It was indeed heartening to see a young maestro, adept at khyal gayaki, bravely attempting a full fledged thumri recital without the traditional component of khayal gayan.Kaushiki mesmerised the audience with lilting, intensely romantic thumris of the bygone era popularised by the legendary Bade Ghulam Ali Khan saab such as &#8220;Jiya mora na laage balamava&#8221; in Misra Tilang and &#8220;Yaad Piya Ke Aye hai Ram&#8221;, &#8220;Ye Dukh saha na jaaye&#8221; . Pt. Vyasmurthy Katti on the harmonium imparted a magical dimension to Kaushiki&#8217;s melliflous rendition. Pt Ravindra Yawagal captivated the audience with his gracefully nuanced tabla accompaniment; mellowed and dulcet in the laggi portion portion of the thumri by Kaushiki, vibrant and energetic in the drut compositions played by Purbayan Chatterjee.
