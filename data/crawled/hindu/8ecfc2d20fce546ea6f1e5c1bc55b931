VSanjay&#8217;s creativity came to the fore as he wove singular idioms during the swaraprasthara. While each one was aesthetically rich, it also  heightened the mood of the raga. There was hardly a swara that was not improvised as each one appeared with a volley of microtones.&#8216;Nannuvidiji gathalakura,&#8217; a Tyagaraja composition in Reetigoula, set to Adi tala, highlighted the  musician&#8217;s penchant for melody. This was marked by alluring neravals.Sanjay chose to open Bilahari with an alapana, which again unveiled his proclivity for innovations. The  composition was &#8216;Paridana michite&#8217; of Pattanam Subramania Iyer in ghanta chapu. Shades of Bilahari coloured with unusual strokes of swara combinations added a new dimension to the raga.In between, the sruti note was  sustained for a long time. Although resorted to as a gimmick by some musicians, the feat, in this instance, appeared quite befitting the structure of the alapana.Technical virtuosity was discernible as the aohana and avarohana of the raga appeared among the swaras with syncopations. The number was also an expression of the musician&#8217;s quest for variety.For Abheri, the composition selected was Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8217;Kayarohaneswaram bhajare&#8217; in Roopaka tala. This was on Siva of Nagapattinam. Sanjay tried the earlier feat of sustaining a prolonged sruti note here also, but it could have been avoided. Executed in a slow tempo, the rendition was  sweet and melodious.A welcome change was &#8216;Thiruvadi saranamentrikenan nambi vanthen,&#8217; a Tamil composition of Gopalakrishna Bharati in Kamboji, Adi;  also an invocation of Siva. The mood of supplication was well portrayed in each syllable.The remarkable aspects of Sanjay&#8217;s artistry is that while melody is his forte, he gives equal importance to technical aspects  and never forgets to entertain his listeners so that his performance caters to all sections of the audience. The major raga he chose for the evening was evocative of this.Elaboration of Todi was on an exceptionally large canvas. The composition was Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Jesinadalla marichithimo&#8217; in Adi.The &#8216;tani&#8217; by Kovai Prakasan (mridangam) and Uduppi Sreedhar (ghatom) was in the right proportion.  Edappally Ajitkumar accompanied on the violin. Sanjay&#8217;s concert was organised in connection with the inaugural function of  Sangeetha Sabha Rasikapriya.
