VBefitting the occasion  &#8212; an evening in memory of M.S. Subbulakshmi &#8212; the concert of Bombay Jayashree forSrutimagazine provided remarkable abundance of rakti, a product of the emphatic superiority of her melodic bhan\u000ai. She touched the very soul of tenderness of music that lent an emotive distinction with her ideal fastened to serenity.The satin-finish softness of her voice enabled her to chisel raga passages of delicacy. The appeal of the sanchara lines and subtleties of expression sprang from karvais and silences between the phrasings. Finesse in bringing manodharma and articulation close to each other evoked the characteristic bhava of each raga admirably.Jayashree presented the gentlest image of Kedaragowla (&#8216;Venugana Loluni&#8217;) full of grace and elegance. The sharper picture of the raga  was not weighed by mere scholarly heaviness. In the rendering of kirtanas there was a marvellous blending of the vocal idiom with their classic stature. The arresting aspect was the way she awakened the imbedded sahitya beauty. This distinguishing feature could be sensed in the songs, &#8216;Muruga Muruga&#8217; (Saveri) &#8216;Akhilandeswari&#8217; (Dwijavanti) &#8216;Mayamma&#8217; (Ahiri) and &#8216;Sankaracharyam&#8217; (Sankarabharanam). It was  harmony that she visualised between sound and sahitya.After hearing her interpretation, it was difficult to decide whether Jayashree fondled the kirtanas or the latter fondled her exquisite exposition. In style and substance it epitomised the underlying spiritual basis of real sangita.Madhyamavati (&#8216;Saravanabhava Guhane&#8217;) and Sankarabharanam (&#8216;Sankaracharyam&#8217;) were the two ragas well elaborated. The alapana development of the former had many scintillating variations in the tarasthayi and every such sanchara went her way.With a flow  of natural ease, Sankarabharanam stood for bounteous beauty. The vinyasa represented her inspiring moments perceiving ecstatic possibilities welling within her. The impeccable shape she gave to Sankarabharanam was of intense significance in creative imagery. As the sancharas beckoned her to savour their charm, stunningly set in cadences, each one was more appealing than the previous one.At her best, her singing philosophy seemed to be to make sensitive rasikas anubhava-wise richer and create a desire in them to listen to  her again, because her approach to sangita was rooted in emotion and not dry technique. She gave to the kriti, &#8216;Sankaracharyam,&#8217; a prestigious halo.As her tribute to M.S. Subbulakshmi, her programme included &#8216;Sriman Narayana&#8217; (Bowli). &#8216;Bhavayami Gopala-Balam&#8217; (Yamankalyani) Meera Bhajan, &#8216;Hari Tum Haro,&#8217; &#8216;Kurai Ondrumillai,&#8217; and &#8216;Maithrim Bhajata.&#8217; The accompanists, R.K. Sriramkumar (violin) and Arun Prakash (mridangam) took note of the proper signals of Jayashree&#8217;s music to rise up to the quality.There was compulsive refinement in Sriramkumar&#8217;s violin support which spoke of the strength of his talent base. In the course of his career he seems to have added a new dimension to the accompanying method. As for Arun Prakash, he gave reality to the dictum, &#8216;Sogasuga Mridanga Talamu,&#8217; by putting faith in mellowness.
