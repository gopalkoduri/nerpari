VVasudha Keshav, accompanied by S. Yashasvi (violin), A. Radhesh (mridanga) and R. Ramesh (ghata), presented a vocal concert recently as part of the Sri Sargur Narasimha Murthy Endowment Programme of the MES Kalavedi, Bangalore.The performance began with an emphatic rendering of Veena Venkatagiriappa's varna &#8220;Vanajaksha&#8221;, set to Gambheeranatta raga and adi tala, to which were appended a few avarthanas of kalpana swaras. A brief sketch of Saranga was then followed by &#8220;Gananathane&#8221;, a composition of Periyasami Thooran, also in adi tala. Kalyanavasantham was taken up for a short alapana that highlighted its evocative appeal, notable for the occasional stress on the dhaivatha during the ascent to the thara sthayi, and for the imaginative phrases that ran the entire gamut of the scale. The Deekshithar krithi &#8220;Sree Venkatesham Bhajami Sathatham&#8221; in rupaka tala, sung in a mellow tempo eminently suited to its lilting yet dignified charm, and suffixed with brisk kalpana swaras at the madhyamakala sahithya beginning &#8220;Shankha Chakra Dharam&#8221; completed a well constructed and executed item.The succeeding expansion of Nattakurinji was suffused with raga bhava, replete with key phrases that combined improvisational acumen with strict adherence to the complex structure and weighty classicism of the raga. A full-throated akara at certain junctures would, however, have infused the exercise with greater vitality and revealed more effectively the true range and quality of the voice. Veena Kuppayyar's krithi beginning &#8220;Needu Moorthy&#8221; in adi thala was ornamented with a fairly detailed neraval at &#8220;Indiraramana Gunabharana&#8221;, made especially striking by the thara sthayi positioning of the sahithya. The ensuing kalpana swaras in the second speed were enlivened by a number of single avarthana segments leading to a final focus of diminishing tala cycles ending at the dhaivatha, and including a modicum of rhythmic patterns.A bracing &#8220;Bhogeendrashayinam&#8221; in Kunthalavarali raga prefaced the main raga of the evening, Mohanam. The alapana was both meticulous and elaborate, and infused with the traditional flavour of the Carnatic idiom. Thyagaraja's &#8220;Nannu Palimpa&#8221; in adi tala was presented with a neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Vanaja Nayana&#8221; and followed by a tani avarthana. A number of compositions by a variety of composers included in the well-planned recital were indicative of the lead artiste's wide repertoire and dedication. The concert, which was augmented by competent accompaniment by the violinist and exemplary support and understanding from the percussionists concluded with Purandaradasa's &#8220;Venkatachala Nilayam&#8221; in Sindhubhairavi raga and adi thala.
