The first day events were particularly notable for the way the outstation artistes were featured, while the other two days showcased the college talent in Carnatic and Hindustani music and Kuchipudi dance under the watchful eyes of their gurus.The mandatory Pancharatna ganam by all the students and their gurus together was the opening day&#8217;s remarkable event. On that day Bonala Sankara Prakash of Chennai&#8217;s AIR gave a display of his artistry on veena with B.V.S. Prasad of Vijayawada AIR lending mridangam support. Of the repertoire he chose,Sogasuga Mridanga Talamuin Sriranjani,Manavi Alakimchain Nalina Kanthi andAbhimanamu Kavalein Hamir Kalyani were his numbers.Tulasi Viswanath of Rajamundry gave a pleasing vocal recital. Her main essay of the concert was Thodi and she exploited the large scope of the rich raga. She built it in all the three octaves with ease, maintaining tempo.Raju Vedale, her choice number in this raga, was pleasantly rendered by her.The swarakalpana was quite extensive and carried the melodic line. Saxophone concert by R.M. Krishnamurthy of Ramakuppam was another arresting concertThe popular Pancharatna Kirtana of ThyagarajaEndaro Mahanubhavuluin Sri Ragam was simply lapped up.
