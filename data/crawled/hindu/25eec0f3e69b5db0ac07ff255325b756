VJITENDRA PRATAPMeenaxi Mukherji is a Sangeet Visharad from the Gandharva Mahavidyala Mandal. While the khayal and the tappa are her forte she is equally at ease with the light classical music as well. She has received a number of awards from various cultural organisations. Meenaxi received her earlier training from the Gwalior gharana's leading exponent Laxman Krishnarao Pandit and later on from Pandit Ramesh Nadkarni of the Bhendi Bazar gharana in Mumbai, which received its fame during the time of the legendary Ustad Aman Ali Khan. Pandit Shrikrishna Haldankar alias Babanrao initiated her into the notable nuances of the Agra and the Jaipur idioms in khayals. One did appreciate her choice to commence her recital with the dusk-time melody of raga Puriya Dhanashri known for its serene melodic appeal and its criss-cross format. The well-known khayal composition "Ab to Rutmaan" set to slow tempo Ek tala of 12 beats was given a befitting handling with a highly reposeful alap-badhat.  Itgradually developed with pleasingly improvised  sargams and well-computed taan patterns and few sequences in bole-taans that were well conceived. With yet another equally well-known Teen tala composition "Payaliya Jhankar Suniree Maine" she rounded up her impressively rendered exposition in Puriya Dhanashri with noble effect.Her concept of good concert planning again became evident in her renderings in the colourful melody of raga Kedar with the charmingly rendered madhya Teen tala composition "Kanha re Nand Nandan, param niranjan", a favourite of the Gwalior maestros and followed with a brisk-paced Ek tala composition. A scintillatingly rendered tappa in khamaj and a Meera bhajan in raga Bhairavi "Muraliya Baaje" came in as a fitting finale to her well-planned vocal recital.She had commendable support on the harmonium from Jairam Poddar and on the tabla from Prasun Chatterjee.Bottom Template Starts
