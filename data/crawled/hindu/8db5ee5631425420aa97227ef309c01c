VThe young artiste sings with surging verve, and his concert is dynamic rather than delicious. In his style, one finds a preponderance of fast-attracting brilliant display of virtuosity rather than long-lasting gentle melodic engagement.  Overall approach simulates musical mannerisms of luminaries in the field, more in form than in essence, naturally limiting the scope of whole-hearted appreciation. Moreover, ideas repeat very often. Imposing expressions undermined the appealing import of the compositions.To get into more details consider Kamalamanohari (&#8220;Kanjadalayathakshi&#8221; - Muthuswamy Dikshitar), wherein he exhibited astounding extempore. His shruthi jnaana and swara jnaana commanded all attention. Nevertheless, rhythm-oriented accentuations deprived the succulent Sanskrit lyrics of its sweetness and grandeur. He could have advantageously infused many areas in the sahithya like Kanjadalayathakshi, Kamalamanohari and Kunjaragamane, with majestic airs by employing delicate intonations.The potential young artiste, on similar grounds, as above, was not convincing in Naatakapriya (&#8220;Idhi Samayamu&#8221; - Vasudevacharya) too. The basic pattern of developing the alapana did not differ from that of the previous mentioned raga. Neraval at Paramapurusha, though scholarly, could not evoke divine feeling for want of polished intonations.In &#8220;Swara Raga Sudharasa&#8221; (Shankarabharana - Thyagaraja), klishta sancharas and swarakalpanas never deviating from their designated swaras was clear evidence to the artiste&#8217;s dedicated practice. Yet, spiky and jerky movements affected the sancharas, and therefore, the endeavour did not foster the expected raagabhaava. In addition, frequent rasps (because of hurried and exaggerated expressions mainly in alapanas) were a source of concern and uneasiness.&#8220;Neranammi&#8221; (Varna &#8211; Kaanada - Ramnad Shrinivasa Iyengar), &#8220;Lambodaram Avalambe&#8221; (Kamboji-Mysore Vasudevacharya), &#8220;Emani Pogadudu&#8221; (Veeravasantha - Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Taala Beku&#8221; (Bhairavi - Purandaradasa) were some of the other inclusions.Geetha Murthy sang under the auspices of Shruthimanjari Pratishtana, accompanied by Veena Suresh (violin), H.L. Shivashankaraswamy (mridanga) and H.L. Ananthakrishna Sharma (ghata). The senior singer endowed with a supple voice presented the compositions with commitment, though there appeared a deficiency of catching musical movements. She started with Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer&#8217;s &#8220;Evaribodha&#8221; (Abhogi) in two paces packed with compact and acute akaaras. When she elaborated Dharmavathi (&#8220;Parandhamavathi&#8221; - Muthuswamy Dikshitar), her manodharma started taking definite shape and momentum. Her voice articulated pleasingly in the taara sthayi. A neraval at &#8220;Paramathma&#8221; also had pleasing sentiments the raaga naturally supported.Alapana in Kamboji (&#8220;Shivam Harim Sambam&#8221; - Muthayya Bhagavathar) had all the expected nuances. A slow tempo appreciably favoured the overall lyrics by clearly conveying the import, and a neraval at &#8220;Khagavaahana&#8221; followed by kalpanaswaras flavored the selected passage.Yet, she could have made it attractive had she presented it with more imagination. Just involvement and commitment were not  enough to raise the concert to appreciable heights.&#8220;Krishna Ni Begane Baaro&#8221; (Yamuna Kalyani -Vyaasaraayaru), &#8220;Naanena Maadideno&#8221; (Revathi) and a tillana were the other highlights.
