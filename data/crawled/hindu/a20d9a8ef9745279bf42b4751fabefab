VVeena Kampana by Sudha VadirajSuswaralaya College of Music, Rs. 100The audio CD album &#8220;Veena Kampana&#8221; gives the connoisseurs of Carnatic music a glimpse of  of Sudha Vadiraj&#8217;s artistry on the veena. She had the good fortune of being trained by highly revered teachers like Prof. R.N. Doreswamy, M.J. Srinivasa Iyengar, Padmavathi Ananthagopalan.The guidance she received from in vocal music from eminent gurus like M.A. Narasimhachar and Neela Ramagopal has helped her evolve a distinct style of playing that is very close to vocal music. The number of pluckings she employs to produce a musical phrase is much lesser. Such a style of playing has a rich tradition that needs to be nurtured. Shubha Santosh, a promising young artist, has accompanied her guru in this album with considerable distinction.The album displays diversity in the selection of compositions in terms of ragas and composers. It is indeed praiseworthy that songs by a wide range of composers who represent different styles of composition have been chosen. Though the format of a CD allows for a short duration of playing, the presentation has effectively tried to adhere to the concert pattern.It is refreshing that the song invoking the blessings of Lord Ganesha in raga Kalyani is a rare composition of Muthuswamy Dikshitar.  The rendering is brisk, effective and sets the tempo for the compositions to follow.The limited range and emotional contour of raga Bhouli &#8211; especially as manifested in the krithi &#8220;Srimannaaraayana&#8221; - makes one feel a raga with greater energy and scope for delineation could have been selected.In Kaapi one sees the gamut of possibilities the raga allows. The gradual elaboration and innovative patterns of notes give a wholesome treat of Kaapi.A rare composition in Vijayanagari  by Muttaiah Bhagavathar  Brings out the nuances of the raga, in the alapane as well as the kalpana swaras.The composition &#8220;Palinchu Kamakshi&#8221; is preceded by a leisurely and expansive delineation of Madhyamavathi, especially in the lower octaves. The taana has a rich variety and has been played to various rhythmic schemes.Noted mridangist H.S. Sudhindra has exhibited his vast experience in the conception of the album. The mridangam accompaniment proceeds well with the rendering on the veena in parts. However, on the whole, it seems incongruous with the rhythmic progression of the krithis. Dayananda Mohite has ably supported on the ghatam. The album portends the rich music that is to emerge out of the learned artiste.
