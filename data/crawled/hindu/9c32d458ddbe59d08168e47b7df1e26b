VN. Rajam, the accomplished violin maestro of Hindustani classical music gave a superb performance at the Swathi Thirunal Music College Auditorium, Thiruvananthapuram. An exponent of the Gwalior Gharana, she is an illustrious disciple of Pandit Omkarnath Thakur, who himself was a student of the legendary Vishnu Digambar Paluskar.Dr. Rajam opened her concert with the rag Yaman (Kalyani in the Carnatic style). The alap and boltan in the &#8216;slow and fast&#8217; modes were noteworthy for the skilful bow control and the resultant tonal quality of the instrument. Her explanation of the finer points of the various aspects of the composition was highly appreciated by the audience which had a lion&#8217;s share of music students.Desh is originally a Hindustani rag, but very commonly used by the musicians of Carnatic style also. Intrinsically a captivating rag, the strains of the violin produced a haunting experience of listening to Desh. This piece was in Madhya Laya.The Meera bhajan, &#8216;Payoji Mene Ram Ratan&#8217; was played next. The devotional hymn sung by many an artiste including Paluskar, is one of the all time favourite of music lovers. Bhajans along with thumri, tappa and so on belong to the light classical variety of Hindustani music.&#8216;Vaishnav Janto Tene Kahiye,&#8217; the popular bhajan composed by Narsi Mehta was played with aplomb in the rag Khamaj. Readers will remember with nostalgia the singing of this bhajan by the inimitable M.S. Subbulakshmi.Dr. Rajam brought her concert to a close with  Bhairavi, one of the most popular and pleasant ragas of the Hindustani classical repertoire.  It was a short, memorable concert which was marked by the explanatory comment of the artiste interspersed with the playing of the violin. To an audience which was not well versed with the Hindustani classical music intricacies these comments were very welcome.The concert was jointly organised by &#8216;Swaralaya&#8217; and the Swathi Thirunal College of Music in honour of Dr. Ali Akbar Khan, D.K. Pattammal and Michael Jackson.
