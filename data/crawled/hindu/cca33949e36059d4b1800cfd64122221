VSuswaralaya College of Music, in association with ISKCON Bangalore, conducted Yuva Chetana recently, a three-day music festival with a series of concerts, lecture demonstrations on a variety of topics, and dance performances by young artistes. A flute recital by Ravichandra Kulur, accompanied by H.N. Bhaskar (violin), Neyveli R. Narayanan (mridanga) and S.N. Narayana Murthy was featured on the second day of the festival. A brisk beginning was made with &#8220;Sarasijanabha&#8221;, the ata thala varna in Kamboji, to which the mellow shades of Chandrajyothi in Thyagaraja's &#8220;Bagayanayya&#8221;, suffixed with kalpana swaras, provided a vivid contrast. A succinct alapana of Bilahari that skimmed through the octaves was followed by an effervescent &#8220;Parithanamichithe&#8221;, Patnam Subrahmania Iyer's composition set to khanda chapu thala, also embellished with kalpana swaras.The succeeding elaboration of Ranjini unfolded with mellifluous phrases, many of which were anchored around the rishabha and the dhaivatha, with the gently oscillating gandhara and perfect sruthi aligned shadja serving as adjuncts. The Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Durmargachara&#8221;, rendered with a cascade of kalpana swaras, was followed by Swathi Thirunal's &#8220;Gopalaka Pahimam&#8221; in Revagupthi raga and misra chapu thala, notable for its sedate pace.The main item of the evening was a raga thana pallavi in Vagadheeswari. The detailed raga alapana incorporated many sancharas in the mandra sthayi which were especially attractive. The fairly detailed thana also emphasised the juxtaposition of the shatshruthi rishabha and anthara gandhara in the thara sthayi to great effect. However, the exposition of the pallavi set to aditala was comparatively brief. The kalpana swaras, including some in ragamalika bore testimony to the artiste's technical prowess and formidable laya expertise, supported by outstanding improvisational inputs from the accompanists.&#8220;Tillanas of Mysore Composers&#8221; was one of the topics presented on the last day of the festival. Young violinists Malavika Ramaswamy and Sharada Mohan presented compositions of Veena Sheshanna, Mysore Vasudevacharya, Chowdaiah and Muthaiah Bhagavathar in ragas Kannada, the rare Shuddha Salavi, Hamir Kalyani and Kapi respectively. Vocalist Manasi Prasad spoke and demonstrated, &#8220;Lord Krishna as seen by Different Composers&#8221;, restricting herself mainly to the works of the Trinity and some precursors such as Oothukkadu, given the vastness of the topicViolinist B.K. Raghu touched upon the various aspects of &#8220;Violin as a an Accompanying Instrument&#8221;, including representation of sahithya, panchama varjya ragas and madhyama sruthi compositions, while percussionist B.S. Arun Kumar dealt with the &#8220;Status of South Indian Percussion in Global Music Scene Today&#8221; briefly, alluding to jazz, Latin and African music and linkages with Carnatic rhythm sequences. The highlight of the session was &#8220;Effective rendition of RTP in a Short Duration&#8221; by Chandanabala Kalyan, with a brilliant exposition of a pallavi in Lathangi raga and chathurasra jathi jhampa thala, with the laghu in tishra gathi and the anudrutham and drutham in khanda gathi, incorporating rhythmic variations and ragamalika swaras in Kalyani, Bhairavi, Ranjini and Saveri. Expert comments by senior musicians, on all the topics in seriatim, added lustre to the abundance of young talent on display, and to the highly commendable efforts of the organisers.
