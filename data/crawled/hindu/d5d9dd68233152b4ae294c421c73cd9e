VDespite the sticky weather on a mid April afternoon, the concert at the Astika Samajam at Alwarpet the other day should have ordinarily been enjoyable.But the decibel levels were disproportionate to the audience assembled in the sprawling venue to listen to Jayanthi Sridhar who sang to the accompaniment of Jayanthi Keshav (violin), Kumbakonam Ramakrishnan (mridangam) and Chokkanadhapuram Narasimhan (ghatam).Right through the 90-minute performance, I couldn't shift my focus away from the thought that we paid little attention to acoustics in a venue.When I finally regained composure, Jayanthi was already onto her main piece in Todi and her voice gave away signs of not being in the best of shape. But the audience responded well to her interpretation of G N Balasubramaniam's ``Maramanan" in Hindolam earlier and Purandaradasa's ``Ramaramanamabajisi" in Darbarikanada.So what was all the fuss about sound amplification and acoustics? Simply the rants of an angry scribe you may think. But you can't take the audience for granted.GARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMBottom Template Starts
