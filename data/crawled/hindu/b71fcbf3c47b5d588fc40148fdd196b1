VShe started with Veena Kuppayyar&#8217;s Varna &#8211; &#8220;Karunimpa Idi Manchi&#8221; (Shahana), which exposed her bold voice complemented by assertive intonations - indeed pleasing. The gamut of her voice smoothly encompassing taara sthayi panchama along with the dictions remaining unaffected, her refined imaginations flourished unabated. The voice muffled in mandra sthayi.In spite of imaginative nilugades, admirable sense of Shruthi and fluent progression, &#8220;Theliyaleru Rama&#8221; in Dhenuka (Thyagaraja) wanted an emotion- packed rendition (reason: inadequate mood-appropriate voice modulations).There was a method in building up Kalyani (&#8220;Pankajalochana&#8221; - Swathi Thirunal). All the main phrases constituting the framework of an ideal alapana converged at fortifying the main essence of the raga. In this respect, the violinist too aggrandised the overall mood.The presentation featured a neraval at the charana (&#8220;Brindavanantakritha&#8221;) which emphatically commences at shadja (taara) and the adjacent nishadha. Here the artiste could have advantageously infused more of sweet (kakali) expressions taking cue from the composer&#8217;s vision. The swaraprastara that followed conformed to scholarly standards.Fluency enriched the expatiation of Keeravani (&#8220;Kaligiyunte&#8221; - Thyagaraja), other merits running parallel with those of her performance in Kalyani. A neraval at &#8220;Baguga Shri Raghuramuni&#8221;, a few passages of kalpanaswaras and sprightly thaniyavarthana completed the presentation.Nasal accents, hitherto in traces, became conspicuous in the concluding parts of the concert: &#8220;Chinnam Chiru&#8221; (Tamil composition &#8211; ragamalika - emotively rendered), &#8220;Kande Udupi Krishnana&#8221; (ragamalika &#8211; Purandaradasa) and Tillana (Faraz - Ramnad Shrinivasa Iyengar).Veena Mohan sang under the aegis of Shruthi Manjari Pratishtana accompanied by Veena Suresh (violin) and P. Nataraj.Her melodious and delicate voice spanned over the required sthayis retaining its consistency even in the taara sthayi.The articulations in the mandra were sufficient to present the lyrics satisfactorily. Singing with an open voice would have instilled the necessary vitality and the expected emotional warmth into her presentations.Consider &#8220;Padmanabha Palithebha&#8221; (Malayamarutha &#8211; Swathi Thirunal): she conformed to the shruthi remarkably, and hence the voice was pleasing. Swaraprastara followed a neraval at &#8220;Thaapasa Hridalaya&#8221; - perhaps lengthy at this stage.Articulations, which sounded very similar in many areas, affected the general style of approach to ragas, obviously restricting a wholehearted appreciation. Moreover, some of the tangled akara-phrases executed in fast paces, though reflected her committed practice, made her voice appear unpleasantly tremulous.Lathangi (&#8220;Diname Sudinamu&#8221; - Thyagaraja) too tread a similar path. Akaaras were crisp but not deep. The lyrics were reasonably clear, but not emotive. A neraval at &#8220;Shri Lathangi&#8221; preceded a few passages of sprightly kalpanaswaras, which she could have bettered by enriching them with emotive intonations at both the swara and the swaraguccha levels.Other highlights: &#8220;Gam Ganapathe&#8221; (Hamsadhwani - Muthayya Bhagavathar), &#8220;Brihadamba&#8221; (Bhanumathi - Muthuswamy Dikshitar - alapana was fluent and scholarly), and raga (Thodi) - taana (needed to be deeper) - pallavi (&#8220;Hare Govinda&#8221;).
