VYoung disciples DVLN Sastry, B. Ratna and V. Padmaja, of veena virtuoso D.Srinivas put their learning on display at a programme organised at Shilaparamam last week. P. Mallikarjuna Rao on mridangam and N. Jagannadha Rao on the morsing contributed to \u000athe orchestral effect. The veena trio shared the raga play and swaraprastharam besides other creative contributions, while playing the kirthana part in perfect unison. They made it a point to pack their repertoire with popular compositions, keeping in view the audience at the venue. The major show piece was Hindolam with an oft renderedSamajavaragamana. And the raga presentation by all the three instrumentalists sharing it, pointed out at their laudable talent. The kriti rendition was attractive. The tanam and swaraprastharam parts were again shared and all the three vainikas displaying their inherent skills and imagination.The trio opened their show with a traditional Natakuranji varnam -Chalamela. This was followed byVatapiGanapatimin Hamsadhwani. Both these numbers proved quite exercising and helped the trio to adjust to tune themselves with each other and strike form.Manaviyalakimpain Nalinakanthi andRaghuvamsa Sudhain Kadanakutuhalam ragam, both considered favourites with all instrumentalists, were presented with beauty of melodic expression. The  taniavartanam was compelling too.
