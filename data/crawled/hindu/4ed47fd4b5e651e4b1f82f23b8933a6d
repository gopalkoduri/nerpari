VLALITHA KRISHNANSinging at the Sringeri Bharathi Vidyashram, T. Nagar, S. Sowmya was enthused by the support of Amritha Murali on the violin and Manoj Siva on the mridangam. `Baale Baalendhu Bhooshani, a Tyagaraja kriti in praise of Goddess Dharmasamvardhani, in raga Ritigowla, was a polished rendition wrapped up with sparingly deployed kalpanaswaras that headed for a smooth touchdown with an extended final round.Muthuswami Dikshitar's `Veena Pusthaka Dharinim' followed a leisurely and reverential circumambulation of Vegavahini raga. `Saarasamukhi' in Gowda Malhar, a precious nugget from the Muthiah Bhagavathar treasure chest, was aired, radiating ripples of interest. The Kiravani alapana was well structured with sensitive prayogas. In the upper register, the thinning of the voice attenuated the imprint of the intricate trellis of ornate passages that could otherwise have been thrown into sharper relief. The G. N. Balasubramaniam composition, `Nee Charanaambhuja Munu' trod a path along brisk walkways lined with contemplative niches. The neraval espoused punch without aggression, laced with adventurous flights, while the sarvalaghu swara motifs at two different eduppus rolled out on well-oiled wheels.Neatly braidedMuthuswami Dikshitar's austere, `Sree Kamalambike' in Ghanta, was followed by Muthiah Bhagavathar's effervescent `Bhuvaneshwariya,' in Mohanakalyani. With a start that glowed bright with promise, and without dwelling overlong in the middle register, Saveri swung to the upper octave to find elegant expression in a network of neatly braided passages. The delineation however, stopped short of plumbing the raga's profound emotional wellspring. Swathi Tirunal's `Devi Paavane' with neraval and swaras at `Saamaja' was streamlined and compact. Amritha Murali stayed close to the main artiste's interpretations and Manoj Siva's crisp rhythmic beats were right on track.Bottom Template Starts
