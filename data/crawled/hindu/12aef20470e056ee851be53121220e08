VSri Krishna Gana Sabha had provided three groups of musicians an hour slot each to present the compositions of these musical giants, Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Syama Sastri. Everyone knows the amazing range of Saint Tyagaraja who had blessed us with a host of kritis of a different genre. His &#8216;Divya Nama Sankeertanams&#8217; are simple and soulful. Teacher and musician Prof. B. Krishnamoorthy,  with his disciples, gave the glimpses of Tyagaraja&#8217;s many well-heard and unheard Divyanama kritis starting with &#8216;Namo Namo Raghavaya&#8217; in Thodi and concluding with &#8216;Rama Namam Bhaje&#8217; in Madhyamavati.His schedule carried &#8216;Pahi Pahi Deenabando&#8217; (Sourashtram),  &#8216;Dasaratha Nandana&#8217; (Asaveri), &#8216;Sri Rama&#8217; (Varali) to cite a few. M.A. Sundareswaran on the violin, K.R. Ganesh on the mridangam and Nerukundram Sankar on the kanjira were part of this efficient team.Gayathri Venkataraghavan&#8217;s band created an aura of fine musical reverie with the choicest compositions of Dikshitar. The well orchestrated offering opened with &#8216;Saravanabhava Guruguham&#8217; in Revagupti.The selection of songs was  also demonstrative of the differing rhythmic structures showcasing the composer&#8217;s facility to set the royal gait of his compositions in Durava (&#8216;Sooryamoorthey&#8217; in Sowrashtram), Jampa (&#8216;Sri Kamambaya&#8217; in Bhairavi) and Kanda Ekam (&#8216;Gange Mampahi&#8217; in Chenjurutti) apart from the regular Rupakam and Misrachapu beats.The Navagraha kriti, &#8216;Sooryamoorthey,&#8217; Chidambara Kshetra kriti, &#8216;Govindarajaya Namasthe&#8217; in Surutti, &#8216;Parvathi Kumaram&#8217; in Nattakuranji. The Bhairavi navavarnam and the final &#8216;Mamava Pattabhirama&#8217; in Manirangu turned conspicuous with their towering span and perfect enunciation and articulation. Saritha, Aparana, Senthil, and Gowri accompanied Gayathri in absolute accord. Padma Sankar on the violin, Erode Nagaraj on the mridangam and Chandrasekar on the kanjira complemented with their support.None can gainsay the scholarship and the ability to train the younger generation of veteran vocalist Suguna Purushothaman. Suguna with her students Gayathri, Nandini, Saranya, Iswarya and Mythili explored the limited number of Syama Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Meenakshi Navavarnamalika&#8217;. Yes, the selected compositions were devoted to Meenakshi instead of Syama Sastri&#8217;s usual favourite Kamakshi.The most interesting and absorbing &#8216;Rave Parvatha Raja Kumari&#8217; in Kalyani set to Misra Jampa, &#8216;Devi Meena Netri Brova&#8217; in Sankarabharanam and &#8216;Devi Nee Pada Sarasa&#8217; in Khambodi were precious pieces from the cache of Sastri. These apart, there were popular &#8216;Meena Lochana&#8217; (Dhanyasi), &#8216;Mayamma&#8217; (Ahiri), &#8216;Nannu Brovu&#8217; (Lalitha), &#8216;Marivere&#8217; (Andandabhairavi) and &#8216;Sarojadalanetri&#8217; (Sankarabharanam). Young S. Karthik (violin) and R. Sankaranarayanan (mridangam) offered their part in maintaining the pace of the group.
