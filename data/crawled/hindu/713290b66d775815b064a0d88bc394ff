VSetting the mood with &#8216;Thandi hawa ke jhonke,&#8217; he cast a spell with &#8216;Deewaaron se mil kar rona achcha lagta hai,&#8217; the melancholic lilt from &#8216;Mukarrar,&#8217; one of his early albums.Interspersing the songs were nuggets of information that  he had collected during his 27-year-long ghazal journey. Lacing the chat with  humour, he referred to the pre-conceived notion that prevails around the muse and Bacchus steering the voice of a ghazal singer. What predictably followed was, &#8216;Sabko maloom hai ki main sharabi nahi.&#8217;Choosing the nazm (a verse that tells a story) &#8216;Ikkees-wein sadi&#8217; by Zafar Gorakhpuri, which panned the lived cultures of three generations, it was a telling comment of the changing times. If the earlier generation slept soundly it was because they were guileless &#8211; &#8216;Sote the neend gehri, dil me kapat nahi,&#8217; ours is the age where we belong to none and none belongs to us &#8211; &#8216;Ab mera na koyi, har admi akela,&#8217; but we wish the coming generation all calm, the one thing we crave for &#8211; &#8216;Hamne sukoon ko tarse, tumko sukoon barse.&#8217;Next came two of his early songs for Hindi films &#8211; &#8216;Chitti aayi hai, watan se chitti aayi hai&#8217; and &#8216;Jiye to jiye kaise bin aapki.&#8217; The rendering of &#8216;Chaandi jaisa rang tumhaara&#8217; earned the singer resounding applause.Pressed for time, Udhas resorted to the medley route and the audience had &#8216;Aayiye, Baarishon ka mausam hai,&#8217; &#8216;Nikalo na be-naqaab,&#8217; and  the evergreen &#8216;Ghunghroo &#8211; Main itna zor se naachi ki ghunghroo toot gayee.&#8217;Supported by musicians Rajendra Singh (violin), Nasir Querishi (mandolin), Anupam Chatterji (keyboard) and Rashid Mustafa (tabla), the musical soiree was well packaged.The concert was organised by &#8216;Jalsa,&#8217; an effort launched by the Indian Music Academy to provide a platform for legends and up-and-coming artistes to promote Indian classical music.
