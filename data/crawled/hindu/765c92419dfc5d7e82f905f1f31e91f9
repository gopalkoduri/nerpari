VThe Jayadev Utsav organised annually by the Odissi Akademi, Delhi has created a niche for itself.  On the second evening of the festival L.K. Pandit showcased the khayal style rendering of ashtapadis that the Gwalior gharana is famous for.Panditji informed that it was his great-grandfather Pandit Krishna Chinchwadkar, who selected ashtapadis from Jayadeva&#8217;s &#8220;Geetgovinda&#8221; and requested Ustad Haddu Khan, the founder of Gwalior gharana to compose the music.He presented &#8220;Nath Hare&#8230;&#8221; in raga Bhupali, set to vilambit ada chautala of 14-beat cycle and gave it an elaborate treatment with aalap barhat, boltan et al as a bara khayal. &#8220;Jai Jayadeva Hare&#8230;&#8221; was rendered like a chhota khayal set to teen Tala.The beauty of his exquisite rendition was that the sahitya was treated with great reverence without breaking any word to suit the vocal virtuosity of &#8220;Taan-Tihaayee.&#8221; Asif Ali Khan on sarangi and Faiyaaz Khan on tabla gave him the desired support.Ustad Yunus Hussain Khan Society organised an evening focused on the late Ustad Vilayat Hussain Khan of Agra gharana at the IIC the other day.Senior musicians like Ustad Asad Ali Khan, Ghulam Siddique Khan, L.K. Pandit, Shanno Khurana and Malti Gilani spoke on the music and persona of the late Ustad, who was hailed as &#8220;Laya ka Badshah&#8221; (emperor of rhythm) by none other than Aftab-e-Mausiqui Ustad Faiyaaz Khan.Ustad Vilayat Hussain Khan was one of the star artistes of Agra gharana, a prolific composer who came up with numerous compositions with the pseudnym &#8216;Praan-Piya&#8217;, a revered guru who produced a number of performing artistes under his tutelage, an advisor to All India Radio and a sensitive poet. The spoken words were followed by the vocal recital of one of his renowned disciples Pandit Yashpal, who rendered a few of Ustad Vilayat Hussain Khan compositions in raga Shuddha-Kalyan, Jog, Yaman and Rayasa Kanhara.The VSK Baithak presented an impressive vocal concert by Padma Talvalkar at the Satya Sai Sabhagaar recently. Initiated into music by Pandit Gangadhar Pimpalkhare and further groomed by gurus like Mogubai Kurdikar, Nivrittibua Sarnaik and Gajananbua Joshi, Padma has assimilated the best of Gwalior, Jaipur Atarauli and Kirana gayakis embellishing it more with her own personal touch.That evening she gave an altogether new interpretation to oft-heard bandishes (compositions) like &#8216;Sakhi mori rumjhum&#8230;&#8217; in raga Durga.The imposing oscillation on mandra dhaivat while rendering &#8220;Baadar Garje&#8230;&#8221; and the flourish of the descending lightening Taan in &#8220;Barse&#8230;&#8221; created a visual depiction of the lyric.The Chhayanat, Jog and the concluding thumri Bhairavi &#8220;Aaye na baalam&#8230;&#8221; &#8230; everything that she sang, her vibrant voice lent wings to imagination and virtuosity. She had superb support on sarangi by Sarwar Hussain, harmonium by Paromita Mukherjee and tabla by Vinod Lele.
