VTheir first day concert of the Navaratri festival at Sri Kamakshi Amman Koil, Coimbatore, was enjoyed by all those who sat through and those who stopped for a while during their visit to the temple.There was a shower of the choicest songs on the goddesses  that began with &#8216;Kamalamba Samrakshathu Maam,&#8217; the Navavarana kriti in Anandabhairavi by Dikshitar. &#8216;Durga Devi Duritha Nivaarani&#8217; (Navarasa Kanada), &#8216;Hiranmayeem Lakshmeem&#8217; (Lalitha - Dishitar), &#8216;Devi Brova Samayamidhe&#8217; (Chintamani -Syama Sastri) and &#8216;Paluku Tenela Talli (Abheri - Annamacharya) were some of the kritis they presented.Following Vijayalakshmi&#8217;s lovely alapana in Mohanam, they sang &#8216;Kadambari Priyayai&#8217; which was rare and refreshing.The main piece, &#8216;Kamakshi Gowri, (Saveri - Papanasam Sivan) preceded by Chitra&#8217;s delineation of the raga, was excellent with niraval for the line, &#8216;Sri Varadaraja Sodaree&#8217;.They stole the show with the Neelakanta Sivan composition, &#8216;Nathanai Nambum Bothare Inba Nattai Aalvare&#8217; in 18  ragas, with the names of the ragas incorporated in the sahitya itself. There was total concentration as the audience tried to decipher the names of the ragas.With sister  Hemalatha on the violin, father K. Rangachari on the kanjira and Nellai Balaji on the mridangam, the Mambalam Sisters filled the evening with melody and devotion.Carnatica Brothers K.N.Shashikiran and P.Ganesh presented a rich fare comprising kritis on Devi on the second day. After the varnam in Ranjani, they presented &#8216;Pahimam Sri Rajarajeswari&#8217; (Janaranjani &#8211; Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan).Beautifully embellished &#8216;Ekamresha Naayike&#8217; in Karnataka Suddha Saveri by Dikshitar appeared with a lovely delineation of the raga, niraval for the line, &#8216;Paamara Jana Palini Guruguha Janani&#8217; and kalpanaswaras.The regal swara jathi by Syama Sastri in Yadhukulakhambodi,  &#8216;Kaamaakshi,&#8217; was rendered in all its majesty. &#8216;Arula Vendum Thaye&#8217; (Saramathi Dandapani Desikar), &#8216;Akilandeswari&#8217; (Dwijavanti - Dikshitar), &#8216;Baale, Baalendu Bhushani&#8217; (Ritigowla - Tyagaraja), &#8216;Naanoru Vilayattu Bommaiyaa&#8217; (Navarasa Kanada - Papanasam Sivan) were in place.The Oothukkadu navavaranam, &#8216;Bhajaswa Sri Tripurasundareem&#8217; being the kriti for the second avaranam was  appropriate and  the brothers rendered it majestically, bringing focus to the incredible beauty of the lyrics. The main kriti, &#8216;Sri Kanthimathim&#8217; was the choice of the audience as Shashikiran let them have a say in that. His detailed delineation of Hemavati showed his hard work and imagination.Earlier, Ganesh&#8217;s Dwijawanti explored the myriad possibilities of the moving raga. The brothers concluded their concert with a few more songs on Devi. If Palakkad Swaminathan (violin) admired the talent of the brothers, he also gave them admirable support.Thiruvananthapuram Vaidhyanathan on the mridangam and Kovai Mohan Ram on the ghatam played with great spirit. The concert, however, was one meant for the knowledgeable rasikas.
