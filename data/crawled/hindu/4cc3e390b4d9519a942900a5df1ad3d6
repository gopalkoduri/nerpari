VR. K. Srikantan&#8217;s booming voice and definitive singing defies his age. It is incredible to watch the nonagenarian maintain complete control of his concert at Hamsadhwani, which was a rich tribute to Purandaradasa. He was supported by M. Chandra\u000asekaran on the violin, Umayalpuram Sivaraman on the mridangam, S. Karthick on ghatam. Srikantan was vocally assisted by Ramakant. It is a fact that of the 1,000-odd compositions of Purandaradasa, only a few are popular.The kritis Srikantan chose that day were mostly unfamiliar and it would not be wrong to say that most of them would have been heard for the first time by many.&#8216;Saranu Siddhi Vinayaka&#8217; in Sowrashtram was the well-known opening number. Srikantan preferred to include several compositions on this occasion instead of presenting the ragas and swaras at length. Nevertheless, he essayed the essence of many ragas such as Pantuvarali, Arabi, Vasantha, Ritigowla and Mohanam (by Ramakant) and Suddha Saveri. Most of the time, the senior singer&#8217;s expertise was showcased in bringing out the best of the raga in a few phrases as preface and add a little more appeal with  a few rounds of swarakalpanas in the middle or end of the kriti.Among the host of ragas, Ritigowla (by Srikantan) and Mohanam (by Ramakant) deliberated the exotic shades of the ragas.Ramakant&#8217;s contribution in this concert was substantial, both in raga and swaras, and his voice infused delicacy to the renditions. &#8216;Guruvina Kulamana&#8217; in Pantuvarali, &#8216;Drishti Ninna Pada&#8217; in Arabhi, &#8216;Kodu Bega Divyamati Saraswati&#8217; in Vasantha, &#8216;Harikatha Charana Mado&#8217; in Ritigowla and &#8216;Enu Danyalo&#8217; in Thodi were some significant items presented. The concert turned out to be a fitting tribute to the legendary composer as the focus was more on introducing the lesser heard songs of Dasar.Chandrasekaran, Sivaraman and Karthick backed the main artist with humility. R.K. Srikantan was honoured with &#8216;Hanrag Hamsadhwani Award&#8217; on the occasion for his contribution to Carnatic music.
