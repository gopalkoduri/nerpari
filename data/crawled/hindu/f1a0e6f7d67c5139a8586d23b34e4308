VAs part of its weekly concerts, Nada Bharathi organised Kamalaramani&#8217;s vocal recital recently.Kamalaramani, disciple of Venkata Chary and D.K.Pattammal presented her concert in a very traditional manner in the company of experienced accompanist K.Venkata Krishna on violin.  Ramani opened her recital with Saverivarnamand went on to singVallabha nayakasyain Begada with elegantswaram.Thyagaraja&#8217;sRaramaintidakain Asaveri was the next to follow in a steady way followed a briefalapof Mandari, a rareragamheard these days was bravely attempted andParalokabhayain Adi withswarakalpanawas appreciable. Mohana was taken next forEvararu ra ninnuvinain Misrachapu rendered with less confidence lacked punch.The main attraction was Bhairavi and Ramani did ample justice to theragampart. The DeekshitarkrithiBalagopala was rendered in a mechanical way and she has to work on themanodharamaand the feel of the rendition can be improved. Krishna on violin added lustre to the concert with his apt following.Finally she concluded with a JavaliModijhesevelaand Thillana.
