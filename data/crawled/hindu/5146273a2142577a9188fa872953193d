VThe Erode Tamil Isai Sangam, under the leadership of Chandran, aims to promote Tamil Isai.The Inter Collegiate Classical Music Competition is conducted by the sangam to inculcate in young minds the spirit to push through their career in music as an amateur or professional.This year the Sangam organised the vocal recital of Mahathi.Before the performance began, the anchor, Sakthi Nallasivam, requested the artist to share her bio-data with the audience and recall some of the interesting anecdotes in her career as a musician.When the artist complied with his request, the audience, especially the college students, evinced much interest.Clear renditionMahathi began her concert with Bharatiar's song in Nattai. Muthu Thandavar's &#8216;Adikondar' in Mayamalavagowla and Neelakanta Sivan's &#8216;Enraikku Siva Krupai Varumo' in Mukhari were well rendered and Mahathi sustained the tempo.The artist took up Suddha Hindholam for elaboration. Her approach was direct, simple and unambiguous. Her step by step construction of the entire gamut of the raga revealed her expertise and hard work.Kudos to Swaminathan, the violinist, who brought out the melodious part of the raga within a very short time. His expertise and mastery over the instrument are such that even the intricate sancharas, both in raga and swara rendering, seem to be &#8216;child's play' for him.What applies to Suddha Hindolam, applies to Varali also. The artist gave a systematic and elaborate rendition of Varali sandwiched with bhava and melodius brigas.With his expertise and maturity, Swaminathan (violin) painted a beautiful portrait of Varali.The percussion artists, both mridangam (Koviladi Madhwaprasad) and ghatam kept the audience spellbound by making inroads into the territories of mathematics in Laya Vinyasa.The song, &#8216;Eppo Varuvaro,' enthralled the audience. Madurai Mani Iyer invested this song with grace and colour.It is a timeless creation on a time determined stage. It reminded one of the saying, &#8216;Music is enough for a life time; but a life time is not enough for Music.'
