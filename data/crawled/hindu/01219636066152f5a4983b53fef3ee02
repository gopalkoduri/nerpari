V&#8216;Devadeva&#8217; of Swati Tirunal in Mayamalavagowla is a safe bet at the beginning of a concert to set the momentum and when it is embellished by lively sarvalagu kalpanaswaras the tone and tenor are assured.Anandabhairavi has a timeless allure and Syama Sastri in his kritis  has sensitively portrayed its captivating beauty and splendour to the optimum. The soothing rendering of his &#8216;Marivere Gathi&#8217; in misra chapu by the singer speaks well of her involvement with the emotions of the composer. The athletic swara improvisations for &#8216;Tolianma&#8217; in Bilahari set to Kanda Chapu had total felicity of expression, precision and musical comprehension.The alapana of the 10th Melakartha Natakapriya was a flawless exposition in terms of maintaining the raga swaroopa throughout without nebulousness, despite the compound nature in its structure. The swara passages in the charanam of &#8216;Idhisamayamu Brovaradha&#8217; free of barrage of mathematical calculations, were impressive outputs.Kalyani dealt at length had a rich vein of melody coursing through the vein of the alapana. In Dikshitar&#8217;s Navavarna kriti &#8216;Kamalambam Bhajare,&#8217; the niraval and swaras had a polished finish and dignified bearing.The percussion dialogue had a refined rhythmic consciousness. The Natakapriya and Kalyani raga essays on the violin reflected Murari&#8217;s technique being well organised and his competence in presentation.The concert concluded with a Javali in Kapi and Veena Seshanna&#8217;s Chenchurutti Tillana.
