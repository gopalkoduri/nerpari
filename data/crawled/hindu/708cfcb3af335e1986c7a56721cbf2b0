VDeep classicism and a feel for aesthetics enabled Sankari Krishnan to present a satisfying vocal recital in Palakkad. Well trained by Lalgudi Jayaraman, she revealed the traits of a seasoned artiste. Opening with a Tamil pada varnam &#8216;Devar Muni\u000avar Tozhum&#8217; in Shanmugapriya, composed by Lalgudi Jayaraman, she rendered Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Mahaganapathim manasa smarami&#8217; in Natta, with great bhava.Melodic nuances of Saveri were well brought out in the raga delineation and the interpretation of the Syama Sastri kriti &#8216;Sankari Sankuru Chandramukhi,&#8217; embellished by a sparkling neraval and swaraprastharas at &#8216;Shyamakrishna Sodhari.&#8217; &#8216;Durga Devi durita nivarini,&#8217; a less-heard kriti of Muthiah Bhagavathar in Navarasakannada, was a welcome choice.A brief sketch of Janaranjani followed by a brisk &#8216;Vitajalathura,&#8217; a Tyagaraja composition, was enjoyable. Sankari chose Thodi for detailed elaboration; the analytical development of the raga was enchanting though she did not traverse much in the upper octave. The song was Tyagaraja&#8217;s Lalgudi Pancharatna kriti &#8216;Gathi Neevaninekori,&#8217; in praise of Goddess Srimathi, the deity of the temple at Lalgudi.She did not attempt any neraval, but did full justice to kalpanaswaras. Before taking up ragam, taanam and pallavi, she gracefully rendered &#8216;Adaathu Asangaadhu Vaa Kanna,&#8217; a famous kriti of Uthukkadu Venkata Subba Iyer in Madhyamavathi.Exposition of Kalyani, the raga selected for Pallavi, was on traditional lines. The Pallavi &#8216;Guha va Muruga va Shanmugha Nee va Gurupara Kumara,&#8217; in Kanda jaathi jampai taala-kanda nada was an intelligent exercise.The concluding session proved to be an exhilarating essay of soulful music. The influence of the Lalgudi style was visible in the poignant portrayal of &#8216;Enna tavam seidanai&#8217; in Kaapi, a Papanasam Sivan kriti. Sankari concluded her concert with a Thillana of Lalgudi Jayaraman in Kanada.Accompanists Pudukkottai Ambika Prasad on the violin and Mannarkoil J.Balaji on the mridangam acquitted themselves creditably. The latter&#8217;s taniavarthanam was neat and crisp.The concert was held under the auspices of The Palghat Fine Arts Society.
