VFive years ago Pankaj met a fan of his who had played hisghazalNa Kajre Ki Dhar45,000 times, and of course he was touched. When theghazalsinger recalls such moments of sheer nostalgia and the fan following, he simultaneously moans the lack of such enthusiasm and love forghazalsin the young generation."I don't understand the reason for such an imbalance. Whenever I give a concert, whether in India or abroad, people throng to the auditoriums. But when it comes toghazalsin the music industry, it is regularly witnessing a downslide movement. And piracy has a lot to do with that. And surprisingly, this generation  thinksghazalsare only for sad and drunk people," laments Udhas. But he thanks films in the same breath! Be itChitthi aayi haiinNaam,Jeeyein to Jeeyein KaiseinSajan,orKisi Ne Bhi To Na DekhainDil Aashna Hai, they all earned him much name and fame.Now,  he has come up withHasrat, his new renditions brought out by T-Series, a dedication to his fans.R.S.Bottom Template Starts
