VPercussion support can make or mar a concert. The South-based artiste Neyveli Skanda Subramanian provided mridangam support and the Delhi-based artiste P. Vetriboopathy accompanied Nityasree Mahadevan on the kanjira at a recent concert organised by Dwarkalaya at Delhi Tamil Sangam. Skanda Subramanian seemed to occupy most of the percussion space in this concert. On the other hand, Vetriboopathy,  as the artiste technically referred to as the &#8216;secondary accompaniment&#8217; (upa-pakkavadya) for this concert, and not quite an experienced hand,   vied for an equal amount of percussion space. There was a wide chasm in their standards, too. In addition, they did not seem to have that &#8216;perfect understanding&#8217; during the course of the proceedings. The result &#8212;  concert lost its lustre.As the two-day Chithirai music festival was organised as a tribute to the popular Tamil composer Papanasam Sivan, Nityasree&#8217;s recital centred on Sivan&#8217;s compositions.  From his wide body of works, she selected the necessary musical forms to structure her concert. These included the opening piece, a pada varnam, &#8220;Swami Nada&#8221; in raga Nattaikurunji, and a piece invoking Lord Ganesha, &#8220;Sri Vatapi Ganapatiye&#8221;. Her centrepiece, &#8220;Narayana divya namam&#8221;, and a number of songs she rendered after the percussion duet that marked the concert&#8217;s mid-point, were once again Sivan compositions. Some of these songs, Nityasree mentioned, she learnt from her grandmother, the renowned vocalist D.K. Pattamal, who learnt directly from Sivan.In &#8220;Kumaran taal panindetruve&#8221; in raga Yadukulakamboji,  Nityasree brought  the raga bhava of the composition to the fore. In  &#8220;Narayana divya namam&#8221; in raga Mohanam, which the vocalist chose for elaborate presentation,  various musical aspects came to the fore. Apart from a fine alap to introduce the raga and the composition that was presented with clarity, she launched into creative improvisations with lyrics and melody in the neraval, and with note patterns in the swaraprastaras. M. A. Krishnaswamy provided good support on the violin, and his sketch of raga Mohanam too was very good.In another concert in this series, Ganesh and Kumaresh presented a violin duet, which was characterised by some outstanding presentations but also some gimmicks on the violin.  The melodious sound that emanates from their instruments, the perfect symphony when each one is playing the same note but in two different octaves and the adept handling of the compositions  are all testimony to the hard work done by these siblings over the years.Sadly, all these get eclipsed in the gimmicks  they also resort to. These include kalpana swaras  that sometimes reach breakneck speed, and playing higher and higher notes, beyond the Pancham of the upper octave.While presenting Sivan&#8217;s &#8220;Kapali&#8221; in raga Mohanam, Ganesh and Kumaresh presented crisp and lively swaraprastaras. Before presenting &#8220;Nee Irangavidinil&#8221; in raga Attana (Sivan&#8217;s composition), Ganesh the elder brother brought out the complete essence of the raga even in his brief alapana. They also brought out well the emotive content of the lyrics. Yet another Sivan composition, &#8220;Venkataramana&#8221; in raga Latangi, underwent fine treatment.  Kumaresh&#8217;s alapana served as a fine and detailed sketch of the raga. As the main presentation of their recital, the brothers took up a detailed presentation of Sivan&#8217;s &#8220;Janakipate&#8221; in raga Kharaharapriya. Ganesh delineated this raga in stages and brought out well  its essence.The presentation of the composition as such was good. Parupally Phalgun on the mridangam and S. Krishna on the ghatam provided the violinists understanding support. They were able to rise to the occasion whenever required to join in the super-speed swara passages. Their tani avartanam (percussion duet) in Adi tala was captivating.
