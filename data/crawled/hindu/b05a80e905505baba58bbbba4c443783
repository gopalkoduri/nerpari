VHe, however, does not hide his disappointment at not being able to make it big in Malayalam film music, despite a promising start. &#8220;Maybe because I was shy and didn&#8217;t want to ask for opportunities. That was also the time when our music directors were hesitant to try  new voices, unlike today,&#8221; says Murali, who was chosen recently for the Sangeetha Nataka Akademy award for light music.&#8220;Since I was based in Vatakara and I had a government job, I couldn&#8217;t go to Chennai and stay there hoping to get assignments. During those days only few composers like K. Raghavan were prepared to encourage new singers; he was the one who gave me my first song in &#8216;Thenthulli,&#8217; and I have learnt a lot from him,&#8221; says the singer who himself has turned composer.He brought out his second album of light music recently, titled &#8216;Paduka Nilave,&#8217; in which P. Jayachandarn, G. Venugopal, Srinivas and Sujatha have sung. &#8220;Composing is something I enjoy. I used to compose and sing Malayalam poems several years ago. Recently I  tuned some poems of O.N.V. and Sugatha Kumari for children.&#8221;Another passion for Murali, who has sung over 200 songs in plays, is the Carnatic raga Mohanam. Last year he conceived a stage show featuring songs from Malayalam films and plays based exclusively on Mohanam. &#8220;And the invitations keep coming in.  The show is not just for those who are knowledgeable about music, it can be enjoyed by a lay audience as well,&#8221; says Murali.He chose Mohanam for the programme for obvious reasons: it is one of the most widely used ragas in Malayalam films.Explains Murali, &#8220;I have always been fascinated by the amazing variety of Mohanam; it can portray a wide range of emotions. Devarajan was the one who made the best use of Mohanam, with compositions, like &#8216;Ezhu sundara rathrikal&#8230;&#8217; (&#8216;Aswamedham&#8217;), &#8216;Devaloka rathavumayi&#8230;&#8217; (&#8216;Vivahitha&#8217;) and &#8216;Swargaputhri&#8230;.&#8217; (&#8216;Nizhalattam&#8217;). I was also  impressed by the way Bombay Ravi used the raga, especially in songs like &#8216;Manjal prasadvaum&#8230;&#8217; and &#8216;Aareyum bhavagayakanakkum&#8230;&#8217; (&#8216;Nakhakshthangal&#8217;). &#8221;All those songs have great lyrics too. Says Murali, &#8220;Now, the music directors find it a challenge to compose a song to suit the limitations of most singers.&#8221;
