VIf the recent &#8216;Mile Sur Mera Tumhara' video proved that music is a binding force, so will Aikya India 2010, a musical offering by Global Adjustments.The show that will see the vocal powers of Aruna Sairam blend with the creative eye of Thota Tharrani and the wordplay of Ranjani Manian, will unfold on March 27.The concert is for a cause, and in this case, it's Smrutha Dhvani, an initiative of Interface, an NGO, and Global Adjustments, to care for retiring or retired artists in the field of the performing arts.The format is the brainchild of Aruna Sairam. &#8220;Actually, while in college, we used to host what we called the Magic Carpet show, where songs from various Indian languages would find a place. That theme seemed perfect for Aikya India 2010.&#8221; This also gives Aruna a chance to showcase a wide repertoire of songs that she has learnt over the years travelling the length and breadth of India.She recalls, &#8220;While living in Rajkot, I once heard a Rajasthani musician sing a local folklore with just an ektara to keep beat. The song moved me so much that I decided to learn it at once.&#8221; Similarly, she found herself &#8220;in the midst of thousands of devotees during the magnificent Rath Yatra of Puri Jagannath and heard the Oriya bhajan. I managed to get somebody to write down the lyric and learnt it. The Bengali bhajan I learnt is sung at Kolkata's Mahakali temple at 3.30 a.m. daily.&#8221;Melodies such as these from 12 Indian tongues including Sanskrit, Marathi, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, and of course, Tamil will be presented by Aruna on March 27. As Aruna adds, &#8220;The theme is unity in diversity, but the underlying bhava will be bhakti.&#8221;Setting the stageLending an aesthetic air to the proceedings will be the simple yet striking stage decoration by Thota Tharrani. &#8220;White, the colour of divinity, purity and peace, will envelop the stage. I plan to use letters of the alphabet from various languages to illustrate the theme. And maybe light it from below to create the right atmosphere,&#8221; is how Tharrani chooses to describe his vision of the sets. &#8220;The set should be such that it does not distract . In fact it should complement the music.&#8221;Playing sutradhar will be Ranjani Manian, the moving force behind Global Adjustments. &#8220;We have all along been playing cultural connectors to expats and have helped them see India. To that effect, we plan a multimedia presentation of photographs of India as perceived by expats.&#8221; There will be eight accompanying artists.Ranjani will take the audience through Aruna's songs, and in the process showcase a nation that moves forward in spite of and because of its multi-cultural ethos.[The Aikya India 2010 show, sponsored by The Standard Chartered Bank, will be presented on March 27, 7 p.m., at MVSR Hall, Lady Andal School, Harrington Road, Chetpet. Donor passes (Rs.2,500, Rs.1,000, Rs.500 and Rs.250) are available at Global Adjustments, No.5, 3rd Main Road, R.A. Puram; Landmark (all outlets); Odyssey (Adyar and R. A. Puram); Chamiers; and Amethyst (Gopalapuram). Book online at www.indianstage.in. For details, call 98800 36611.]
