VTrivandrum K. Krishna Kumar has many points in his favour; a soft but solid voice that can traverse a commendable range, the ability to present a raga and a kriti highlighting the finer aspects without resorting to overstatement and a pleasant disposition on the stage. With all these qualifications, Krishna Kumar should be getting more performances.His concert for Shanmukhapriya started with a skilfully composed pada varnam &#8216;Omkara Pranava Nada' in raga Shanmukhapriya by his guru Dr. Balamuralikrishna. The mastery of the guru was evident in the way the swaras and sahitya were set with a smart swarakshara in the charanam. The entire gamut of the raga was showcasedin this fine piece.&#8216;Gananathane' in Saranga (Periaswami Thooran) with a swara string led to the rendition of &#8216;Janani Ninnuvina' in Ritigowla. The Thodi raga treatise began with short phrases but settled into several lengthy attractive motifs. Krishna Kumar's sanguine touches on the mandra and tara sthayi confirmed his profound conception of the classical form.&#8216;Dakshayani Abhayambike,' a rarely heard Dikshitar number came as a pleasant surprise. The kriti was appended with many slices of swaras focussing on panchamam.Nagaswarali, which normally comes in as a filler, took centre stage in Krishna Kumar's concert. He took up this raga for a Ragam Tanam and Pallavi -- the pallavi was set to Tisra Triputa tala. The raga expansion done in two parts.Main pieceA tanam that moved to the beats of the mridangam and ganjira, and the short but sweet pallavi with niraval and trikalam with ragamalika swaras, completed the exercise impressively. Krishna Kumar's raga essays were carefully but cleverly structured, pitching mainly on the melodic strength of the raga. His swarakalpana were never unwieldy ambles or rambles.V. Sanjeev on the violin matched the vision of the main artist and yet at the same time established his individuality. Sanjeev's Thodi exposition and the pallavi sessions were brilliant. Neyveli Skandasubramaniam in the company of K.V. Gopalakrishnan dominated throughout the concert with his extra robust percussion beats. His thani, replete with crisp and sharp exchanges with Gopalakrishnan, was remarkable.&#8216;Edari Sancharinthu' in Sruthiranjani (Tyagaraja), &#8216;Marivere Dikkevvaru' in Latangi (Patnam Subramania Iyer) and &#8216;Yadavaraya' in ragamalika (Kanakadasa) were the other bright items of the concert.(A last word: The perfect balancing of the audio is still a distant dream in many concerts. The over-powering percussion, the shrieking mike or a feeble violin always keep demanding attention through frantic signals from the artists.)
