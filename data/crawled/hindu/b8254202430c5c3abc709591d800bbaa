VThiruveezhimizhalai S. Kanaka made a favourable impression on the listeners at Mahatma Gandhi Mandapam, Pollachi, through her vocal concert under the auspices of Pollachi Tamizhisai Sangam.A well-trained professional dancer, Kanaka evinces equal interest in Carnatic music.Thiruveezhimizhalai Dakshinamurthy Pillai was her first guru. Later, she was trained by V.N. Ramesh Kumar and  now she is under the tutelage of Dr. Sirkazhi Siva Chidambaram.Kanaka began her concert with a rare varnam in Sumanesaranjani by Thiruveezhimizhalai Subramania Pillai. The rich timbre of her voice and her emotional rendering of the compositions enabled her to strike an immediate rapport with the audience.&#8216;Idhu Thaano Thillaisthalam&#8217; in Behag by Gopalakrishna Bharathi, &#8216;Kaarya Kaarana Swaroopane&#8217; in Soorya by Lalitha Sivakumar, &#8216;Kapaali&#8217; in Mohanam by Papanasam Sivan and the &#8216;Sakthikkooththu&#8217; in Sivashakthi by Bharathiar were presented elaborately.&#8216;Paadi Paadi Panivom,&#8217; a composition in ragamalika on the Sirkazhi Moovar (Muthu Thandavar, Arunachala Kavirayar and Marimutha Pillai) by P.S.V. Raja, was enjoyable.She rendered the Tiruppugazh verse, &#8216;Muthaiththaru&#8217; with absolute ease following the sprightly thillana by Lalitha Sivakumar.The team with senior vidwans such as Madurai Meenakshi Sundaram on the violin, Pudukkottai Gopikrishna on the mridangam and Tiruchi Rajaraman on the ghatam  was supportive and encouraging.Kanaka has to work harder in the areas of raga delineation and swarakalpanas to impress the connoisseur.Considering her age (she is a plus two student) and her dedication, she is sure to make a name for herself in the near future.
