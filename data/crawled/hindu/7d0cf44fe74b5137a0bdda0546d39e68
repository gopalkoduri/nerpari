VThe India Habitat Centre presented Sharad Sathe&#8217;s vocal recital recently. It was a rare opportunity to listen to an old timer who had been trained under Pandit D.V. Paluskar &#8212; the son and disciple of the legendary Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar. He also trained under the famous musicologist B.R. Deodhar and the veteran vocalist of the Gwaliar gharana Pandit Sharat Chandra Arolkar, who not only passed on to his disciple the rich repertoire of khayal, tappa and tarana compositions of the gharana but also gave him the insight into the ideological base of the Gwalior gayaki.Sathe opened his vocal recital with raga Shuddha Kalyan. After a brief alap  he rendered a bada khayal &#8220;Sumiran kar&#8221; set to slow Jhumra tala in the typical tempo of Gwalior , which is not too slow as the trend set by Ustad Amir Khan and followed by most of the vocalists today. The development of the raga during the alap-badhat and the bol-alap adhered to the grammar and proceeded gradually towards the upper octave, the taar saptak. He wound off the slow composition with a variety of taan sequences. The chhota khayal &#8220;Anokha laadla&#8221; was set to drut Ek tala which was followed by a crisp tarana in Teen tala.Raga Hameer was an apt choice for the second course after the main raga, in which he presented a composition set to drut Ek tala. His singing style was reminiscent of the old world charm, especially the concluding bhajan &#8220;Jab Janaki Nath sahaay kare&#8221; immortalised by the late D.V. Paluskar. He had commendable accompaniment by Vinay Mishra on the harmonium and Vinod Lele on the tabla while Samir Sathe, his son and disciple, gave him vocal support.Kala Vihar concluded its year long Golden Jubilee Vaarshikotsava dedicated to &#8216;Nritya Samrat&#8217; Guru Shambhu Maharaj on his 37th Punya tithi last week, also at the Habitat Centre. The spirit behind all its cultural endeavours, Manjushri Chatterji, founder-director of Kala Vihar, also paid tributes to &#8216;Sarod Rani&#8217; Sharan Rani who passed away last year. Pandit Birju Maharaj, the chief guest of the evening,  recalled an anecdote of the late Shambhu Maharaj known for his impeccable abhinaya.Asked by the lights man which colour he would need, the stalwart admonished him, &#8220;Who are you to give me colour? My eyes would dictate the bhava and rasa!&#8221;The evening began with a Kathak performance by the senior students of Kala Vihar, showcasing Taalim Natawari Ki, where the crisp padhant by Manjushri  stole the show. But the main artiste of the evening was Gaurav Majumdar, a talented disciple of Pandit Ravi Shankar who played raga Bihag on the sitar. Gaurav&#8217;s alap-jod in the main raga carried the signature of his illustrious guru during the elaborations in the mandra saptak&#8217;slaraj-kharaj ka kaam, but thejawaariof the instrument sounded mute, marring the real effect. The detailed alap-jod was followed by a couple of compositions in Teen tala before he concluded with a lighter piece in raga Pilu. Shaibal Chatterjee, a disciple of an equally renowned guru, Pandit Gyan Prakash Ghosh, accompanied him on the tabla.
