VThe Gandharva Mahavidyalaya  that started by Pandit Vinay Chandra Maudgalya seventy years back with just one student, has come a long way. With twelve hundred students on its rolls and the imposing building with the recently added sprawling new wing,\u000a the GMV is one of the prime musical institutions of the capital today. Rasikas look forward to its annual festivals like the Jayanti Samaroh, which has presented not only the stalwarts, but also the debut of many of today&#8217;s top ranking musicians. It has tirelessly served the cause of classical music like &#8216;an eternal journey&#8217;, remaining &#8220;Sangeet mein Satat Nirat&#8221;, hence the six day festival to celebrate its seventy years, was thoughtfully conceived and named as &#8216;Nirat&#8217;.Nirat&#8217;s first three days were dedicated to  music  of superb quality. The highlight of the inaugural evening was the &#8216;Vasant Stavan&#8217; a theme concert invoking the spirit of spring, by Pandit Madhup Mudgal the present principal of the Vidyalaya. Opening with &#8220;Rasa barsaayo&#8221; a composition in raga Bahar set to slow Teen tala, and a drut Ek tala composition depicting the ambiance of Vasant Ritu, he presented a Dhrupad of Indore&#8217;s Apte gharana in raga Hindol, set to Sul tala. The tempo gradually gathered through the lyrics depicting every hue of the colourful season in ragas like Sohani, Shuddha Desi, Basant, even a tappa in Hori Khamaj, reaching the climax in Rasia dhun with three folk songs before concluding with &#8220;Na maaro bhar pichkaari&#8221; in Bhairavi. The crescendo comprised male, female voices, and a lively instrumental ensemble along with the dholak, jaanjh, manjira, et al, apart from the usual tabla and harmonium.The evening  opened with a sitar recital by Niladri Kumar who played a detailed alap-jod in raga Shri for more than 40 minutes before playing a couple of compositions in raga Jhinjhoti set to Rupak and Teen tala. The selection of Shri was apt for the evening hour, but it is a serene raga and demands lot more maturity. Niladri has good command on meend of five, six notes, but he should remember that the concert platform is not a place forriyaaz. There was a drastic need for editing during his repetitive alap sequences. The compositions in Jhinjhoti had the mature tabla support by Tanmoy Bose who never bothered about showing off unnecessary virtuosity.The next evening belonged to Vasundhara Komkali, who opened her memorable recital with raga Kaunsi which is commonly referred to as Jog-Kauns. Explaining its true nature and origin she rendered two famous compositions of Gunidas, Jagannath Bua Purohit, who  also created this raga. She sang a dhun-umag raga Ahimohini, the dhun (tune) to charm a snake, Komal Bageshri, a dhamar composition of Nayak Gopal, a thumri and a bhajan with the typical flavour of Kumar Gandharva&#8217;s gayaki. Kalapini gave her mother the most tuneful vocal support while Arvind Thatte assisted her on the harmonium and Deepak Garud on the tabla. The evening had opened with a melodious flute recital by Rakesh Chaurasia.Venkatesh Kumar presented a reposeful Marva and a colourful Basant before Purnima Chaudhari took over the concluding musical evening with her charming Banarasi thumri, dadra, Hori, chaiti and Bhairavi. A versatile disciple of Mahadev Prasad Mishra, Purnima presented the typical nuances of Banarasi bol-banaav and bol-baant ki thumri, the bandishi thumri and various kinds of Chaiti and Hori. Her delightfulandaaz(demeanor) was so contagious that it spread around not only to the supporting artistes like Vinay Mishra on the harmonium and Vinod Lele on the tabla but also the hypnotised audience.
