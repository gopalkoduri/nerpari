VUnder the aegis of its chapter at Visakhapatnam, SPIC-MACAY organised three recitals of Hindustani classical music on guitar for school children. Minerva School at Seethammadhara, NSTL Schools at its Manasi Auditorium, and Javahar Navodaya Schoool at Kommadi in the port city witnessed the recitals last week.Kamala Shankar from New Delhi who is hailed as the pioneer of exposition of Hindustani classical on guitar rendered the recitals. Impelled by her innate fascination for the guitar and ability at handling it, she trained to play the Hawaiian guitar under the tutelage of Shivanath Bhattacharya at Varanasi. She also worked to innovatively develop a methodology of exposition of Hindustani classical on the instrument.She successfully obtained postgraduate and doctorate degrees of BHU with specialisation of the study of the instrument's suitable modification. The specially designed and made instrument is called Shankar guitar.She elaborated major compositions set in major thats (ragas) in Ek and Theen Tal (one each) followed by a Bhajan or a Thumri at the different venues. Then she charmingly enthused the children to identify any light or semi-classical song in the ragas she played and sing along with the guitar and come out with questions.A good number of students participated and the interactive session at each school lasted for more than forty minutes. Harjit Singh from Hyderabad accompanied her on tabla.
