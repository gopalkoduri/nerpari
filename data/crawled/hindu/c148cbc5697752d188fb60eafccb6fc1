VTVS, who spoke to this writer on the eve of his concert in the same venue 48 years later, has been performing there uninterruptedly for the last three decades, and feels it is a pleasure and privilege to sing before such a discerning and appreciative audience as this one. In fact, he paused in the middle of a neraval the following day, choking with emotion, to thank the assembled rasikas for whatever he has achieved in his musical career.Sankaranarayanan is not the only musician who looked forward to singing in this sabha. M.S. Subbulakshmi, D.K. Pattamal, Semmangudi Srinivasan, Ramanathan Krishnan, Madurai Mani Iyer and Maharajpuram Santhanam were among some of the great musicians who came to perform here, immaterial of the remuneration they received. They came at a time when this sabha did not boast of an auditorium, but used to conduct music concerts in a nearby temple, playground or even on the adjoining footpath. Those were the days when its founder, who ran a stationary shop in Avenue Road, would go from house to house collecting small donations to conduct these free kutcheris.The efforts of this pioneer, CD Gopal Iyengar, have culminated in the Seshadripuram Rama Seva Samithi, which is celebrating its diamond jubilee this year. Its annual musical extravanganza has become a household word among music buffs in this city. Coinciding with the Rama Navami festival, it showcases the best talent in today&#8217;s music scene year after year.The story of this samithi&#8217;s beginnings is fascinating. A stationer(CD Gopala Iyengar), a hotel proprietor (G. Narasimha Murthy), an industrialist (Narasinga Rao Manay), a school teacher (Sreepada Achar), and a well-known lawyer (V. Krishna Murthi) came together to provide first class music to the citizens living in the northern part of the city. The erudite audience sat in the Gaffar Khan Maidana in Seshadripuram (which later became a park) to listen to sublime music by great artists, until the educational society opposite came to its rescue by providing an open air theatre. Resources were limited, and donations were few in those days. But, the samithi has held on for 60 years after those small beginnings. According to the present organisers, it was the money that came from individuals who gave out of bhakthi for Sree Rama &#8211; &#8220;it may be 100 or 500 rupees&#8221; &#8211; that has sustained this remarkable institution.Oldtimers like 84-year-old Sreedhar Iyengar have many pleasant memories from the Fifties. This octogenarian walked from Gandhinagar every evening and sat in a public park to listen to his favourite musicians and composers at the samithi.&#8220;I was late one day,&#8221; he recalls, &#8220;when I heard GNB already singing the todi alapana. He was accompanied by Palghat Narayanaswami. I still remember his elaborate sangathis&#8230;,&#8221; reminisces this music buff, as he breaks into the lovely strains of that immortal krithi by Thyagaraja:&#8220;Yemi Chesithenemi Sri Raama/ Swami Karunaleni Vaarilalo&#8230;&#8221;After 53 years, there could not be a better tribute. Still other residents of Seshadripuram who were present at the Ramanavami kutcheris in those days remember Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar mention that he had not experienced this kind of audience rapport even in Thiruvayyaru during the Thyagaraja aradhana. Remembering the Alathur brothers singing during the Ramanavami season, Vidya Subramanian (Alathur Sreenivasa Iyer&#8217;s daughter) says her father used to enjoy performing in this particular samithi as he found the audience response here very buoyant.In its diamond jubilee year, the Seshadripuram Rama Seva Samithi has evoked many fond memories among the rasikas of this city. As for those who organise these programmes year after year as a &#8220;seva&#8221; to Rama, they seem to have imbibed the spirit of &#8220;service with detachment and dedication&#8221; taught by the early founders. If those creative thinkers envisaged a musical ambience where rasikas would assemble in large numbers to hear great musicians perform, their successors have realised their expectations in no small measure. The very fact that none of them craves recognition for such outstanding service proves their deep commitment to the cause of music.Sree Seshadripuram Ramseva Samithi is celebrating its diamond jubilee this year with a month-long music festival ending on May 12, 2008.
