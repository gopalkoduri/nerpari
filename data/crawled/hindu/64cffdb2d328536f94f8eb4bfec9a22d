VRadha P. Namboodiri (nee Radha Warrier) offered a wholesome fare in her vocal recital at The Palghat Fine Arts Society on Sunday, despite the constraints posed by a troubled voice.Well-groomed by the doyen Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and T.M.Thyagarajan, she displayed the qualities of a seasoned artiste. She imparted a brisk start to the concert with the popular Ada tala varnam &#8216;Neranemmithinayya&#8217; in Kanada, composed by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar.The subsequent pieces such as  &#8216;Vallabha Nayakasya&#8217; (Begada), &#8216;Kanchadalayadakshi&#8217; (Kamalamanohari), both Dikshitar kritis, and &#8216;Pahimam Sri Rajarajeswari&#8217; in Janaranjani, a Ramaswamy Sivan composition, set a striking pace.The raga vinyasa of Poorvikalyani was rich in classical flavour. Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Kaasi Visalakshim&#8217; was well portrayed, with a sparkling niraval at &#8216;Kaasipuravaasinim.&#8217; The kalpana swaras, with a special accent on the Panchamam, vividly projected the raga lakshanas.Mysore Vasudevachar&#8217;s &#8216;Bhajare re Maanasa&#8217; in Abheri, and Tygaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Teliyaleru Rama&#8217; in Tenuka, which followed, kept up the lively tempo.The beautiful shades of Reethigoula flowed with good manodhrma, with the raga swaroopa coming out splendidly.Radha affirmed the legacy of the Semmangudi baani in her rendering of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Dwaitamu Sukhama.&#8217;&#8216;Ardhanaareeswaram&#8217; in the rare raga Kumudakriya is a marvellous creation of Muthuswamy Dikshitar, noted for its sahitya bhava. Radha&#8217;s interpretation of the kriti, marked by a clear articulation of lyrics, was noteworthy.Sankarabharanam was the main raga of the evening. She developed the melody, interweaving elongated kaarvais with graceful gamakas, providingsowkhyam. She rightly avoided sanchaaras in the upper octave because of her  voice problems.The &#8216;thaanam&#8217; and the simple pallavi &#8216;Mahimateliya Rama&#8217; in Adi tala highlighted the characteristic fragrance of the raga. The swaraprastharas were full of varied permutations.&#8216;Parulannamaata,&#8217; the pleasing jaavali of Dharmapuri Subbaraya Iyer in Kaapi, and &#8216;Saapasya Kousalya&#8217; in Jonpuri evoked  pleasant memories of Semmangudi.Radha&#8217;s yen for aesthetics was noticeable in her moving presentations of two Malayalam songs &#8211; &#8216;Haahantha Santhaapam,&#8217; a Swathi Thirunal padam in Neelaambari, and &#8216;Kandu kandennirikkum,&#8217; from Poonthaanam&#8217;s famous Gnanappanai in Naadanamakriya, Chenchurutti and Punnaagavaraali, rendered in Madhyama sruthi.She rounded off her concert with the Swati thillana in Dhanasri, &#8216;Geetha Dhoniku Takatheem.&#8217;N.V. Babunarayanan (violin) was good in his solo raga versions, but his accompanying the vocalist left much to be desired. Ambattur K. Babu gave adequate support on the mridangam. Kottayam Muralidharan played the morsing.
