VThe curtain came down on the tenth edition of the Swati Sangeetotsavam with a sparking concert by Ranjini-Gayatri. The second half of the fete featured a veena concert by Aswathy Thirunal Rama Varma, and vocal concerts by Amrutha Venkatesh, Kunnakudi\u000a Balamuralikrishna, Thamarakad Govindan Namboothiri and Ranjini-Gayatri.Rama Varma, accompanied by B. Harikumar (mridangam), Manjoor Unnikrishnan (ghatom) and Kottayam Murali (morsing), came up with a scintillating recital that included a vocal rendering of a couple of kritis.A swaram-enriched &#8216;Kripayapalaya&#8217; in Charukeshi was followed by &#8216;Rama rama paahi rama&#8217; in Bhoopalam. Prior to playing it on the veena and simultaneously singing the song, he gave a brief explanation of the raga and its salient features by contrasting it with Revagupti. After &#8216;Palayamamayibho&#8217; in Khamas came &#8216;Bhavayami raghuramam&#8217; and the melodious &#8216;Bhogeendra shyayinam&#8217; in Kunthalavarali.The piece de resistance was &#8216;Smarajanaka&#8217; in Behag. Preceded by a sweet but elaborate ragamalika thanam in Behag, Kapi and Panthuvarali, Rama Varma portrayed the raga in all its melting melody. He wound up the concert with &#8216;Vishweshwar&#8217; in Sindhubhairavi and by singing &#8216;Aaj aaye shyaam&#8217; in Mishr Pahadi.Twenty-year-old Amrutha Venkatesh started her concert with &#8216;Sarasijanabha.&#8217; &#8216;Palayamamayibho&#8217; in Kamas and &#8216;Sreekumara&#8217; in Atana preceded &#8216;Kanjanabha&#8217; in Saranga. Amrutha came good in this kriti. Her deep and pliable voice was in form as she decorated the composition with some interesting swarams. Next came &#8216;Santhatham&#8217; in Bilahari, for which she sang the neraval at &#8216;Shreenidhim ambujanabham.&#8217;Despite her youth, Amrutha&#8217;s poise and traditional mooring were evident as she rendered the main keerthanam &#8211; &#8216;Anjaneya&#8217; in Saveri. The thukkadas were &#8216;Chaliye,&#8217; &#8216;Bhaja Bhaja Manasa,&#8217; &#8216;Raajeevaksha Baro&#8217; and &#8216;Saramaina.&#8217; Here is one singer to watch out for.Kunnakudi Balamuralikrishna is yet another young singer who has made a mark in the festival. He was accompanied by Mahadeva Sharma (violin), Palghat Maheshkumar (mridangam) and Sudhir (ghatom).Balamuralikrishna began with a melodious raga alapana and followed it up with a varnam in Kamas.A bhava-laden Asaveri composition &#8216;Palaya Madhava&#8217; was warmly welcomed by rasikas. &#8216;Ahahanaiva jaaney&#8217; in Amrithavarshini was adorned with a quick alapana and swarams.Mahadeva Sharma&#8217;s artistry came to the fore during the alapana and he made each phrase sparkle. &#8216;Santhatham&#8217; in Bilahari was followed by &#8216;Pahitharakshu&#8217; in Anandabhairavi and &#8216;Mamava Jagadeeshwara&#8217; in Saraswathimanohari.Thamarakad Govindan Namboothiri, an uncompromising stickler for tradition, showcased his virtuosity and classicism. Even his selection of songs highlighted his preference for scholarship.He chose to begin his recital with a stately and dignified &#8216;Vanajaksha,&#8217; a varnam in Saveri. &#8216;Smaramanasa Padmanabha&#8217; in Durbar was followed by &#8216;Paripalaya Sarasiruha&#8217; in Panthuvarali. &#8216;Pankajakshanam rameshan,&#8217; a Malayalam composition in Thodi, was rendered in a slow pace. The popular &#8216;Gopalaka&#8217; was a wise choice after the heavy Thodi kriti.&#8216;Rasavilasa&#8217; in Kamboji was the main piece. The surprise of the evening was ganjira player Udipi Srikanth who came up with a pleasing performance. After the thaniavarthanam Thamarakad sang &#8216;Gopala&#8217; in Bagishri and concluded his recital with &#8216;Kantha thava pizha&#8217; in Atana and &#8216;Kosalendra.&#8217;The last concert of this edition by Ranjini-Gayatri was impressive. They were accompanied by Mysore Srikanth (violin), Arunprakash (mridangam) and Udipi Sridhar (ghatam). The sisters began with the Kamas varnam &#8216;Chalamela.&#8217; The selection of compositions, their clear melodious voices and pleasing style of presentation made it a memorable concert.The remarkable synchronisation between the sisters saved it from becoming a group presentation found in schools.A crisp &#8216;Palayamam&#8217; in Nayaki was followed by a raga alapana of Charukesi by Ranjini. &#8216;Kripayapalaya&#8217; was the kriti. Next came a mellifluous &#8216;Gangeyavasana&#8217; in Hamirkalyani. &#8216;Ramachandra&#8217; in Poornachandrika and &#8216;Saadaramava&#8217; in Suruti were sung by the sisters. The sisters seemed to have their fingers on the pulse of the audience as each piece was welcomed with applause.The main was &#8216;Janani&#8217; in Bhairavi, followed by Thani. The thukkadas were &#8216;Bhaja bhajamanasa,&#8217; &#8216;Kanthanodu&#8217; in Neelambari, &#8216;Smarajanaka&#8217; in Behag and a superb Hindustani composition &#8216;Shankarasrigiri&#8217; in Hamsanandi.Their glittering performance to a packed venue brought the fete to an end. Bathed in moonlight the picturesque Kuthiramalika seemed all set for its next edition of the festival.
