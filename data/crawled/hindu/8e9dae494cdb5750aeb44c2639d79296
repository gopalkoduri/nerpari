VGeetha Bennet&#8217;s veena recital featured under the auspices of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts was balmy, majestic and intense.The sumptuous fare she provided in a three-hour recital displayed her musical sense, penchant for virtuosity and dedicated saadhakam for several decades. Her rendition of the Kalyani varnam in vilamba and durita kaalam followed by &#8216;Sree Maha Ganapatim&#8217; (Gowlai) garnished with swaras commanded attention.Geetha&#8217;s alapana of Valaji for the kriti, &#8216;Jalandara,&#8217; punctuated by telling musical phrases was played with appropriate frills, swirls and glides on the veena.Her simple gamakas flowing from her deft fingering over the ferrets for the Begada raga vinyasam was an effortless essay.The soothing strains of music emanating from the divine instrument coupled with her singing the numbers showed her deep involvement in the kutcheri.Geetha unfolded beautifully the manifold hues of Bhairavi in her alapana for the kriti, &#8216;Balagopala.&#8217; &#8216;Oozhikoothu&#8217; on Kali (Subramania Bharati), a hymn from Thiruppugazh and &#8216;Sambho Siva Sambho&#8217; towards the end were joyous presentations.A lilting thillana by Lalgudi Jayaraman in Bagesree closed her musical agenda. Rajsekhar (mridangam) and Purushothaman (ganjira) actively participated in the proceedings and their thani was a testimony of their laya expertise.
