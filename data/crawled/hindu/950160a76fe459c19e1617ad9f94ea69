VM. BALAGANESSINThere can be no better tribute than a musical homage to the late Semmangudi R. Srinivasa Iyer. to mark his 99th birth anniversary.  The Nadhadweepam Trust,  Tiruchi, recently organised a special two-day event to mark the 99th birth anniversary of the doyen. Maharajapuram S. Srinivasan and Tiruchi K. Ramesh, accompanied by popular artistes, rendered kirtanas, that warmed the hearts of the rasikas.What made the programme ore interesting was the fact that the vocalists chose to render the songs which were dear to Semmangudi. Tiruchi Ramesh rendered about a dozen songs and kirtanas with vocal support by R. Abhinaya. B. Shree Sundarkumar supported them on the kanjira.Rare opportunityThe audience also had the  rare opportunity of listening to  Nagai R. Muralidharan and Umayalpuam K. Sivaraman on the violin and mridangam respectively.  The Tyagaraja kirtana, "Chakkani Raja" in Kharaharapriya  was the main item in Ramesh's recital. which lasted for about an hour.The list of songs included ``Kandajoodumi,"  another kirtana of Tyagaraja, ``Smarasundaranguni'' in Paras and ``Parulanna Maata'' in Kapi."It was Semmangudi who played a key role in popularising the ``Smarasundaranguni''  composed by Dharmapuri Subbaraya Sastri,"  Ramesh observed. Kharaharapriya was one of the many ragas which Semmangudi rendered in different styles, each unique in its own way. Semmangudi was noted for presenting different ragas and kirtans making each concert a different experience. The Tyagaraja  kriti, "Padhavini'' in Chalaka Bairavi was one such which  Ramesh rendered in the beginning.Maharajapuram Srinivasan kept the audience spellbound  with his main song, ``Enduku Petala'' in Sankarabaranam. He was accompanied by M. Dinesh  (vocal support) and Srirangam R. Kannan (morsing).Bottom Template Starts
