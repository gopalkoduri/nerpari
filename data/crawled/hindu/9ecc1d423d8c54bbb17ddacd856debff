VTwo unique Hindustani classical vocal music concerts of Rekha Hegde Aravind and Milind Chittal were organised by Sapthak, a Bangalore-based music organisation that has played a vital role in the promotion of Hindustani classical music performances in the city.Rekha Hegde, a disciple of Pandit Kamalalar Bhat and Pandit Parameshwar Hegde, commenced her recital with the late afternoon melody raga Madhuvanti. The vilambit ektal khayal bandish &#8220;Eri Ali Bin Dekhe Man Mohan Ko&#8221; was delineated through an expansive alap in the rhythmic, cyclical movements of ektal, a cycle of 12 beats. The accentuation on the second note rishabh has an uncommon beauty and allure in the raga Madhuvanti and Rekha captured this effectively in her gayaki. The chota khayal rendition &#8220;Ye He Sakhi Shayama Murari&#8221; in the faster drut teental, a cycle of 16 beats, was ornamented with a range of taans and sargams. Rekha concluded her recital with a hori composition &#8220;Aaj Khelo Shyam Sang Holi&#8221; in raga Kafi. Mihir Kalyanpur, a young tabla prodigy who shared the platform with legends like Ustad Shahid Parvez accompanied her on the tabla. Satish Kolli's harmonium accompaniment was commendable.The second concert was by Milind Chittal from Dubai. The Indian diaspora represents a microcosm of the tremendous diversity of people and the cultural traditions of our subcontinent. Many non-resident Indians have made invaluable contributions in areas as diverse as literature, political life, popular culture, music, dance, cinema and sports. Milind Chittal, an accountant based in Dubai and the younger son of the Kannada literary legend Yashawant Chittal, pleasantly surprised the cognoscenti of Bangalore with his erudition and an exemplary sense of dedication that radiated from his exposition. Milind began his recital with the popular evening melody raga Yaman. Traces of the exquisite sweetness and lyricism of his guru, one of the stalwarts of Kirana gharana, late Pt. Firoze Dastur were discernible in Milind's gayaki. Milind embellished the vilambit khayal bandish &#8220;Sakhi kaise kaho eiso lalan ke sang&#8221; through alap, bol-alap, bol &#8211;taans and sargams. His rendition of the popular drut teental composition &#8220;sakhi eri ali piya bina&#8221; was marked by finely chiselled taans. He was ably supported by Srirang Pai on the tabla. The wholesome presentation of raga Yaman was followed by a vibrant and energetic delineation of the melody raga Abhogi Kanada which revealed another significant aspect of Milind's training in Agra gharana gayaki. Milind began with an impressive nom&#8211;tom alap in Abhogi Kanada in the dhrupad style, thereby showing his adeptness and familiarity with the nuances of this gayaki. The madhya laya composition &#8220;Charan dhar ayori, mo par daya kare&#8221; was noteworthy for its lyrical appeal. This was followed by a lilting drut ektal composition of Sadarang &#8220;Aaj mandir javo sakhi, shubh ghadi shubh din&#8221; was marked by dazzling taankari.Milind's versatility was visible in his rendition of light classical genres like bhajans and thumri. His rendition of the bhajan &#8220;Sabse unchi prem sagayi&#8221; was a delightful and creative melange of several ragas such as khamaj, jhijhoti and kedar in pleasing combinations of avirbhav and tirobhav. He concluded his recital with the thumri &#8220;Baju bande khul khul ja savariya ne jadu dala&#8221; in Bhairavi.
