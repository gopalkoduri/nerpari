VPANDIT PARAMESHWAR Hegde, a leading contemporary vocalist, teacher and organiser's naturally  melodious voice travelled to every nook and corner of the auditorium.  His musical statements were precise and clear with nothing vague or hedged in. It had an easy and affable air.  His voice is  generally unvaryingly bright. Pandit Parameshwar Hegde sang to a full house under the auspices of Sangeet Sankalp, Bangalore Branch. Appropriately backed up by Vyasamurthy Katti (harmonium) and Gurumurthy Vaidya (tabla), Pandit Hegde began with an evening melody Pooriya Kalyan. This resembles Poorvi Kalyani of Carnatic music. "Aaj sawan aaye" in vilambit ektal was moving. He ornamented the composition with bol taans, tans and multi-hued phrases. This was followed by a drut laya composition "Dhan dhan". Kedar was the second raga of the evening. Using both shuddha and teevra madhyamas in enjoyable combinations, he revelled in foisting a number of improvisations from his impeccable manodharma. "Kanha re nanda nandan" (madhyalaya teen tal) and "Naveli naar" (drut ektal) fell pleasantly on the ears.  Sargams  lent much charm and liveliness to his renditions. Hegde rounded off his recital with a heart warming and deeply emotional Kabir bhajan "Beeth gaye din" in Bhairavi. He seems to have enjoyed every bit of the concert.Making a markYoung and seasoned exponent of Hawaiian Guitar Prakash Sontakke regaled the audience at the inaugural concert his vocal-based instrumental play. He began with Charukeshi raga (madhyalaya gat, roopak tal and drut teental). He sang a few phrases and reproduced them on his guitar.He gave both artistic and aesthetic dimensions to the raga. He reached the acme of his talent and expertise in the concluding Bhairavi ("Kya karoon").M. SURYA PRASADBottom Template Starts
