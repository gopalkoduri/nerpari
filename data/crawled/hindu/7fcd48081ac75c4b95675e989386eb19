VOn the occasion of Syama Sastri Day, the Indian Fine Arts Society organised the vocal concert of Ragam Sisters, Sivaranjani and Nalinakanti, to the accompaniment of Srilakshmi Venkataramani on the violin, Thanjavur S. Subramanyam on the mridangam and B. Sai Krishna on the ganjira at the Bala Mandir German Hall.The concert showcased the predilection of the siblings to choose some of the fine compositions of Syama Sastri to  best effect. &#8216;Tarunam Edamma&#8217; in Gowlibandu gave a swift start to the concert. &#8216;Mayamma&#8217; in Nattakurinji with a captivating chittaswaram and sahityam, (a speciality of the composer) was impeccably sung bringing the moving appeal through special touches on interpreting &#8216;Mayamma&#8217; and the swara-sahitya.Is it possible to pay homage to the great composer without the inclusion of swarajati, another forte of his ? &#8216;Kamakshi,&#8217; in Bhairavi, moved slightly on a faster trail yet was impressive in its clarity.Another quick number &#8216;Sankari Sanguru&#8217; in Saveri opened the space for Sivaranjani to detail Kedaragowla. It was mounted in a creditable way by Sivaranjani via relentless akaras and brigas in succession; agreed, the ragas image was visualised expertly but had the missing strength of repose and space for reflection  been integrated, the Kedaragowla would have glowed still brilliant.Ragam Sisters exhibit a slightly high pitched tonal quality that could cruise through the tara sthayi sancharas with certain comfort without much exertion. But frequent jab on the notes and phrases above nishada after a point sound stale and strained. Because of this, Nalinakanti&#8217;s account of raga Lalitha sounded just sonorous without soul. The little more reflective and slow approach the sisters  deliberated on in &#8216;Devi Brova&#8217; earlier in Chintamani and during the rendition of the kriti, &#8216;Nannu Brovu Lalitha&#8217; provided the recompense.Swara session honours were shared equally by the singers, violinist Srilakshmi and the percussionists. However, the sisters could exercise a bit of restraint  over the meandering swaras which  culminated  abruptly in  the final korvai.
