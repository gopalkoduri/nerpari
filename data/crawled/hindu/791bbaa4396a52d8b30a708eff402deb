VSriranjini Santhanagopalan, accompanied by Mathoor Srinidhi (violin), Sudarshan Chakravarthy (mridanga), and G. Omkar (ghata), presented a vocal concert at the Nadaranjani Sangeetha Sabha in Bangalore.The vocalist, still in her teens, began with &#8220;Vanajaksha&#8221; the ata thala varna in Reethigowla and followed it up with a brief alapana of Shahana and the Muthaiah Bhagavathar krithi &#8220;Manamu&#8221; set to rupaka thala, and a spate of rhythm-oriented kalpana swaras.&#8220;Narayana&#8221; in Suddhadhanyasi was succeeded by a fairly detailed alapana of Lathangi, notable for a sustained stress on the nishada, and the panchama and shadja varjya phrases around it, before ascending to the thara shadja.The Patnam Subramania Iyer krithi &#8220;Aparadhamulan&#8221; in adi thala was rendered with an impressive neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Kripajesina&#8221;.&#8220;Daya Juchutakidi Velara&#8221;, the Tyagaraja krithi in the rare vivadi raga Ganavaridhi was indicative of a wide repertoire, and preceded the focal point of the concert, a ragamalika raga thana pallavi.The full range, clarity and flexibility of the artiste&#8217;s voice and remarkable powers of improvisation were evident in the alapana of Shanmukhapriya, Hindolam and Behag, and the ensuing thana in all three ragas. The item, rounded off with a thani avarthana, reaffirmed the vocalist&#8217;s virtuosity, suggestive of greater depth and maturity that will doubtless be acquired in the years to come.***Sri Rama Lalitha Kala Mandira hosted a vocal recital by Ranjani Hebbar, accompanied by Charulatha Ramanujam (violin) and B.C. Manjunath (mridanga).&#8220;Vathapi Ganapathim&#8221; in Hamsadhwani raga and adi thala, sung in a brisk tempo, and supplemented with kalpana swaras that blended melody with pace, provided an ebullient start to the concert. A brief but delectable alapana of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Ide Bhagyamuga&#8221; was followed by a leisurely rendering of Deekshithar&#8217;s &#8220;Thyagaraja Yogavaibhavam&#8221; in Anandabhairavi, and a quick &#8220;Bantureethi&#8221; in Hamsanadam.The alapana of Abheri, suffused with lilting raga bhava, underscored the admirable reach and sweetness of the ariste&#8217;s voice, as well as her aesthetic sensibility.The Mysore Vasudevacharya composition in adi thala, &#8220;Bhajare&#8221;, with neraval and kalpana swaras suffixed to the pallavi sahithya, was followed by a thani avarthana.&#8220;Udupiya Krishnana&#8221; in Arabhi provided a lively interlude before the next item, a raga thana pallavi in Nattakurinji. A relatively brief but well-structured alapana and thana led to the pallavi beginning &#8220;Govinda Krishna&#8221;, set to misra jathi thriputa thala, khanda gathi, a demanding exercise that attested to the vocalist&#8217;s commendable technical expertise, apparent also in the ragamalika swaras in Behag, Kapi and Sindhubhairavi.The concluding items included &#8220;Enna Thavam&#8221; in Kapi and a thillana in Desh. Mellifluous accompaniment within the mandate of the vocalist from the violinist, and skilful support from the mridangist were notable features of the concert.
