VLast week, an 11-year-old boy, Kamal Kiran, mesmerised the audience with his mature display of wizardry on the violin and equal skill on the keyboard and harmonica at a programme organised by Sangeetha Ksheerasagaram at Thyagaraja Gana Sabha. At present, he is with his parents  in Virginia, USA. He has taken part in various competitions held there and one at Chennai and bagged awards. He hails from a musical family of Guntur. His grandfather, Vinjamuri Parthasarathy Iyengar, was a great vocalist-violinist. His father, Subhash, inherited that art and gave initial training to his son.Kamal is under the tutelage of renowned violinist A. Kanyakumari. One can safely  describe his performance for Sangeetha Ksheerasagaram as superb.He mainly performed  on the violin though he displayed his skills on other instruments, playing a composition each on them. He was accompanied by Mullapudi Lakshmana Rao and Bacchu Janardan on ghatam.
