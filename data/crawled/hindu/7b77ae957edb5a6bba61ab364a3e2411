VP. Unnikrishnan knows how to charm the audience with his  mix of classicism and bhava-laden music.  This was evident in his  concert  in Kochi recently.He began his concert  with the Natta varnam &#8216;Sarasijanabha,&#8217; with its unpredictable turns and phrases. He executed this with remarkable ease.With its straight long notes, Chakravakam was safe in the hands of the vocalist who rendered &#8216;Sugunamulejapukonti,&#8217; a Roopaka tala kriti of Tyagaraja.A short raga sketch of Pantuvarali covered the entire raga. The neraval in the kriti &#8216;Vatera daivamu manasa&#8217; was sung within the full scale and was further embellished by short swara phrases.Kalyanavasantham was unfurled without much ambiguity, and that marked the striking feature of Unnikrishnan&#8217;s alaapana. The magnificent glides from dhaivatham to nishadam gave that rich feel to the rendition.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Nadalolodai brahmananda&#8217;  was rendered with  apt kalapramana. The vocalist followed a safe  madhyamakala tempo for most pieces.Charukesi scaled high in Unnikrishnan&#8217;s alaapana. However his voice sounded strained when he touched the upper &#8216;ni&#8217; and  the shadjam in the third octave.T.H Subramaniam on the violin complemented the vocalist by painting the essence of the raga in his own contemplative style of bowing. Trichur Narendran excelled on the mridangam as did Thrikkakkara Shantaram on the ganjira. Their thaniyavarthanam was a 15-minute package of discerning rhythmic movements.Unnikrishnan&#8217;s regular numbers such as the ashtapadi &#8216;Pashyati dishi dishi&#8217; (Madhuvanti), &#8216;Pibare Ramarasam&#8217; (Ahir Bhairav), &#8216;Jagadodharana&#8217; (Hindustani Kapi) and &#8216;Brahma okate&#8217; (Bowli) completed the concert. The programme was organised by Bank Employees&#8217; Arts Movement.
