VAmrita Venkatesh sang\u000aunder the auspices of\u000aSushira, V. Deshikachar's\u000aAcademy of Music.\u000aB.K. Raghu (violin), G.S.\u000aRamanujam (mridanga) and\u000aRamesh (ghata) accompanied\u000athe young and tastefully\u000amoulded singer. The role of\u000aall the accompanists was immense\u000ain accomplishing a\u000asuccess.Her voice is not only consistent\u000ain pitch, volume and\u000atimbre, but is equally expressive.\u000aA systematically cultured\u000apractice had yielded its\u000afruits - sweet, divine and\u000amesmerising, as was evident\u000ain all the presentations, direct\u000afrom her memory. Thorough\u000aexpatiation of the ragas,\u000aShriranjani ("Maarubalka" -\u000aThyagaraja), Surati ("Angarakam\u000aAshrayami" - Dikshithar)\u000aand\u000aSimhendramadhyama\u000a("Ninne Nammithinayya" -\u000aVasudevacharya) revealed\u000amany features very much exclusive\u000ato her style. She would\u000aspontaneously strike a proportionate\u000abalance, in length\u000aand intonations, between relevant\u000aindividual swaras and\u000abetween the swara-clusters\u000awhile building up the alapana,\u000aand instantly give a clear picture\u000aof the personality of the\u000araga on hand.Variety of gamakas, in every\u000apossible permutations\u000aand combinations embellished\u000athe sancharas, the patterns\u000aof which would not\u000arepeat: variety of graces\u000asprouted out fluently and\u000agently. Moreover, a clear diction\u000aconveyed the entire import\u000aof the compositions, and\u000athe elegant ease with which\u000ashe narrated them enhanced\u000atheir dignity.Scholarly neraval at "Pannagendrashayana"\u000a("Ninne\u000aNammithinayya"), followed\u000aby elaborate swarakalpana,\u000aaptly focussed on the jiva and\u000anyaasa swaras for the desired\u000aimpact. Other notable compositions\u000awere "Manasu Karugadhemi"\u000a(Hamsadhwani -\u000aPatnam Subrahmanya Iyer),\u000a"Narasimhudu" (Kamalamanohari\u000a- Mysore Sadashivarayaru)\u000aand "Vagalaadi"\u000a(Jaavali - Behag - Tirupati\u000aNarayana Swami).***Another equally interesting\u000aand absorbing concert\u000a(flute) was by Pandit Nityanand\u000aHaldipur (Swarasankula\u000aSangeetha Sabha): verily, a\u000amemorable experience wherein\u000amajesty and melody\u000aprevailed over any unnecessary\u000asuperficial manoeuvrings.The veteran artiste's\u000astage-presence equated with\u000athe maturity of his baaj; and\u000atranscending wafts incessantly\u000aemanating from the\u000ainstrument paralleled with\u000ahis riyaz and sadhana.Set with absolute involvement,\u000aevery presentation\u000aserved as an epitome of\u000agrandeur and beauty.Rag Shri irrefragably trod\u000aa desirable vocal style. The\u000aseries of swaras blending\u000aamong themselves formatting\u000ainto tuneful phrases\u000akept on assuming new dimensions\u000aas he instantaneously\u000acreated new passages.Further, in the vilambit\u000asections he would judiciously\u000ainsert faster ones with\u000asuch imagination and creativity\u000athat the overall mood\u000aalways rested on the slower\u000atempo thus working as firm\u000afoundation on which peaceful\u000aexperience dawned with\u000aresplendent glory.Another absorbing feature\u000awas the pre-eminence of a\u000asentimental similitude suggestive\u000aof the moods of submission\u000aand devotion, as one\u000amay find embedded in the\u000acheez, "Kaha Mai Guru" at\u000aonce transporting the audience\u000abeyond the abstract\u000ainto the realms of concrete\u000asublime emotions.In similar admirable fashion,\u000ahe developed Jhinjoti,\u000aimpressively exposing a deep\u000acontemplative mood of delight\u000aand contentment, indeed\u000aa remarkable piece of\u000areverie, supported by inspiring\u000acadential intricacies by\u000athe veteran percussionist,\u000aRavindra Yavagal.Purya too, passing through\u000athe major movements, occupied\u000aa prominent place in\u000athe minds of the listeners.
