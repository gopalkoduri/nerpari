VG. JAYAKUMARCarnatic vocalist Neyveli R. Santhanagopalan's superb delineation sparkled like dewdrops at sunrise as he immersed himself in Neelakanta Sivan's `Ananda nadamaduvathille... ' in Poorvikalyani (set to Chappu tala) withswaraprastharas.It was the sixth and concluding day of the 30th annual Neelakanta Sivan Sangeetha Aradhana at the Sree Vageeswara Swami Japa Dhyana Bhajana Mandapam, Karamana.Earlier, Neyveli Santhanagopalan began his vocal recital with the familiar varnam `Viriboni' in Bhairavi, a composition of Pachimiriyum Adiyappa Iyer. He followed it up with Muthuswami Dikshitar's `Vathapi' in Hamsadwani.Shades of Anandabhairavi, Sarangam and Surutti showed up in the form of a ragamalika as the vocalist presented the Thyagaraja kriti `Swararaga sudha' in Shankarabharanam set to Adi talam. The kriti conveys the message that theamruthofswarasand ragas ofbhaktiis akin to the attainment of heavenly bliss. The thaniavarthanam was in keeping with the intricacies of the raga, in no way being neither too loud nor stooping to the levels of a `kasarthu ' commonly seen these days.Enthused by the overwhelming response of the audience, Santhanagopalan rendered `Marukelara O Raghava' in Jayanthisree set to Adi talam. He evoked the feeling ofbhakti, which was the dominant theme in his rendition. The other compositions rendered included `Ora jupudu chedi' (Kannadagoula), `Bhajare ethunaatham, Venkitachala nilayam' (Shanmukhapriya), and Mangalam (Sourashtra).All throughout the concert Santhanagopalan maintained a serene atmosphere mesmerising the audience with brilliantalapana, swara sancharamand short brigas.Bottom Template Starts
