VHis inward energy seemed unstoppable. Nature may have been indifferent to him yet S.R. Krishnamurthy Bhagavathar showed that he never lacked in application, commitment or resolve.His concert opened with the Ata Tala varnam in Bhairavi, followed by two viruthams &#8211; &#8216;Vaakkundaam' and &#8216;Paalum Theli Thenum' - to signal the song, &#8216;Sri Ganesha Saranam' (Thillang, Sivan). His alapanas for Hindolam (&#8216;Samajavaragamana,' Tyagaraja) and Khambodi (&#8216;Evarimata' Tyagaraja) had the touch of lucidity in them - being less complex and more direct in its imagination.His voice had the gift-of-briga associated with it which was used with a sense of proportion and caution.He made an adventurous alapana of Janasammodhini too, for the song &#8216;Govindamiha Gopika' (Narayana Tirtha) and even studded it with kalpanaswaras. The niraval at &#8216;Bhaktha Paradhinudanuchu' in &#8216;Evarimata,' had an orderly approach which was also visible in the manner in which he built his swara designs.The other songs rendered in a principled manner were &#8216;Ranganathude' (Sourashtram, Ponniah Pillai), &#8216;Bantureethi Kolu' (Hamsanadham, Tyagaraja) and Patnam's Javali in Paras.Admirable playSriram Parasuram on the violin oriented himself admirably to the level of the artist and showed his competence by playing a free-flowing Janasammodhini and an exalted version of Khambodi during his raga explorations. His rich techniques were in full play for the raga and swara rounds.Tiruvarur Bhaktavatsalam on the mridangam and T.V. Vasan on the ghatam gave a thani that had a long final korvai with laya patterns woven in with command and grace. They tried to exercise discretion while playing.The goodwill this singer has already earned (he has made 1700 concerts, we were told) was amply evident in the sizeable attendance at the concert and the emotional response it invoked. Still, the inordinate delay in commencing the concert and some ceremonies that interrupted the flow only served to reduce the effective duration of the performance. This concert held at Dakshinamurthy Auditorium was in memory of Doraisamy Iyengar and Janaki Ammal. Raga Tarangini Trust had organised this concert and The Rotary Club of Chennai Mambalam had co-sponsored the event.
