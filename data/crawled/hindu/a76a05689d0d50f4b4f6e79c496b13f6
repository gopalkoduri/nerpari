VHow many people  have the good fortune to speak on the same topic at the same venue after 30  years?Madurai G. S. Mani was recently blessed with this rare honour at the Harvey Kumaraswamy Kalyana Mandapam, Tirupur, under the auspices of the 40-year-old Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha that was resurrected last year.At the recently organised `Isai Amudham-2005,'  veteran vocalist and musicologist G. S. Mani  spoke on `the influence of Carnatic music in film songs.' He first sang the alapana or the swaras of the ragas and then presented the relevant film songs.He demonstrated that the famous `Mannavan Vandanadi' was a slightly varied version of `Vasudevayeni' in Kalyani.The audience was enlightened on the fact that `Allahu Akbar,' the clarion call from mosques, was set in Mayamalavagowla.Mani said Carnatic ragas like Mohanam have been used by musicians in China and Thailand while Kiravani is used in Scandinavian music.The popular numbers, `Mullai Malar Mele' and `Pon Enben Siru Poo Enben,' set in Kanada, `Manmadhaleelaiyai Vendrar' and `Vasantha Mullai Pole' in Charukesi, `Sundari Soundari Nirandhariye' in Kurinji, `Paattuppaada Vaa' in Kiravani, `Unnaikkandu Mayangadha Pergalundo' in Bhairavi, `Ennai Yaar Enru Enni Enni' and `Vaazhnthalum Esum' in Sindhu Bhairavi took the audience on a nostalgic trip.Lively fareOn the second day, Ganesh and Kumaresh presented a lively fare on the violin with Tiruchi B. Harikumar on the mridangam and S. Karthik on the ghatam. Commencing with the Shanmugapriya varnam by Lalgudi Jayaraman, they presented `Enna Saami, Neer Enna Seigireer' in Suddha Saveri by Gopalakrishna Bharati. After an impressive alapana of Poorvi Kalyani, they played Neelakanta Sivan's `Anandha Nadamaaduvaar.'During the neraval and swaraprastharas, the melody flowed swiftly through their deft fingers. `Nadamadithirindha Unakku' in Kambhoji, `Yaaro Ivar Yaaro' (Bhairavi)  and `Eppo Varuvaaro' (Jonpuri) were some of the songs they rendered.Their Mohana alapana was  traditional and "Kapali" by Papanasam Sivan was heart-warming.The concert concluded with  the famous `Madurai Mani Note' and a lilting tillana. Hari kumar and Karthik were as dazzling as the main artistes.Promising young talentShanmukhananda Sabha honoured local veteran musicians   and provided special slots for the up and coming artistes &#151;   5 p.m. daily.  Padmavathi Ramachandran's performance was pleasing.Palladam Sisters, Jayalakshmi and Gayathri, sang a few popular songs.  Ambika Suresh gave a neat performance on the concluding  day. L. Vaidhyanathan showed great promise.B. RAMADEVIBottom Template Starts
