VSri Jagadguru Sankaracharya MahasamastanamSri Dakshinamnaya Sri Sharada Peetam CD MP3 Format - DevotionalHomage to Sri Sadashiva Brahmendral Price not mentioned.Sri Sadasiva Brahmendral was a great saint composer, who lived about 250 years ago between the 17th and 18th centuries.  He emphasised the Bhajana Sampradaya and the Nama Siddhanta traditions. His compositions all in Sanskrit are very few, but they are the epitome of Bhakti. The songs in this album have been rendered by T.M.Krishna and Sangeetha Sivakumar.Auspicious beginningThe album is off to an auspicious beginning with the benediction by Sri Bharati Theertha Maha Swamigal in Telugu, Tamil and Kannada. The Sadasiva Pancharatna Stotram in the five ghana ragas  is a pleasant rendition by both singers. "Bruhi Mukundeti" in Kurinji and "Sarvam Brahmamayam" beautifully tuned in Madhuvanti in the madhyama sruti, have been rendered with considerable musical intensity. "Tungatarange gange" in Kuntavarali  receives a fresh  lease of life while "Bhajare Gopalam" in Hindolam by Sangeetha is underlined with melody.Yamuna Kalyani is a quintessential charmer and "Pibare Rama rasan" has an exclusive appeal. "Nahire Nahi Sanka" in Mohanam and "Manasa Sancharare" in Sama, provide music of riveting quality."Smaravaram" in Behag is sung in a crystal clear voice, "Chintanastikila" in Vakulabharanam truly targets one's musical sensitivities and "Gayati Vanamali" in Hamsadhwani and "Bhajare Yadunatham" in Peelu are top class.  A very positive feature of this album is the apt kalapramanam &#151;  so vital to devotional music.The accompanists are R.K. Shriramkumar (violin), Mala Chandrasekhar (flute), N. Manoj Siva (mridangam) and B.S. Purushotham (kanjira).S.P.Bottom Template Starts
