VMizhavu is regarded as one of the oldest percussion instruments. It is believed that the  mizhavu  originated 3,000  years ago at  Mazhakunnu, near Thalaserry. Till recently, the mizhavu was used as a percussion instrument to support  actors of Koodiyattam,  Chakyarkoothu and Nangiarkoothu.It is largely thorough the efforts of P.K. Narayanan Nambiar, son of the legendary thespian Mani Madhava Chakyar, that the mizhavu came to the forefront and caught the attention of the world as a solo percussion instrument. &#8216;Mizhavu thamyambaka,&#8217; devised by Nambiar, was further popularised by exponents like Kalamandalam Eswaranunni, Kalamandalam V. K. K. Hariharan and Kalamandalam Rajeev.The &#8216;mizhavu thayambaka&#8217; by Kalamandalam K. P. Narayanan Nambiar enthused the audience  at Bharatheeya Vidhya Bhavan Auditorium, Ernakulam.The mizhavu thayambaka was in the same pattern that is followed in the chenda thayambaka. Narayanan Nambiar began the recital  in the &#8216;Pathikalam&#8217; (slow tempo), in which he displayed his proficiency over the instrument. Through various combinations and permutations of perfect strokes played over the small surface of the instrument, Nambiar transported the listeners to new levels of rhythmic excellence.Nambiar changed the rhythm to &#8216;Atandha Koor&#8217; (14 beats) in the second part. The skill and virtuosity of the drummer was displayed more in this part.  His concentration was remarkable throughout the recital.After accelerating to &#8216;Kalasam&#8217;(climax), the drummer came back to Ekathalam. He overcame the limitations of the instrument by displaying resonating strokes of a variety of frequencies, using his left and right palms and fingers. The tempo was accelerated gradually and he skilfully took it to the  crescendo.Kalamandalam K. P. Narayanan Nambiar was well supported by Kalamandalam Ravikumar (chenda) and Kalamandalam Vineesh (elathalam). The programme was organised under the aegis of Bank Employees&#8217; Arts Movement, Ernakulam.
