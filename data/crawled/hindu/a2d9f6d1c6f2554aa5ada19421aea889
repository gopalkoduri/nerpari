VMANJARI SINHAHe concluded the recital with a melodious Bhathiali dhun.The Poorva Sanskritik Kendra (PSK) has taken care of the music lovers who reside in East Delhi and cannot attend the cultural programmes organised at the India International Centre, the Habitat World or at the various Mandi House auditoriums. . Recen\u000atly Sunil Kant Saxena regaled the audience with his impressive sitar recital at the PSK.Initiated into classical music by Professor B.N. Dutta at the early age of  nine years, Sunil has been further groomed by Pandit Uma Shankar Mishra and Ustad Amjad Ali Khan. Having done his Visharad in vocal and sitar, he was also awarded the National Scholarship. He has played sitar both at home and abroad and performs regularly on All India Radio. This evening he opened his recital with raga Rageshri.Having learnt with Pandit Uma Shankar Mishra, his alap had the signature of Pandit Ravi Shankar&#8217;s style in the lower octave&#8217;slaraj-kharaj ka kaam. Although it was just a glimpse, Sunil did prove his training in this sty\u000ale.After the detailed alap-jod-jhala, he played the slow composition in Jhap tala of 10 beats instead of the usual Masitkhani gat normally set to Teen tala. This again was a trait of Pandit Ravi Shankar&#8217;s style. The drut gat (faster tempo composition) that followed was of course in Teen tala. Sunil has got a good command on both sur and laya, along with the technique, but what impresses the most is his own aesthetic sense.He concluded his recital with a melodious Bhathiali dhun that also included towards the end, the famous song by Tagore &#8220;Jodi tor dak sune keu na tobe ekla chalo re.&#8221;This was rendered in the lilting Dadra of six beats. Deepak Mehta gave him commendable support on the tabla.Bottom Template Starts
