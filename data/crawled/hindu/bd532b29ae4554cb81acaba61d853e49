VIt was a performance with the unmistakeable mark of genius as veteran Carnatic musician O.S. Tyagarajan regaled the audience with a consummate  vocal recital.  Both the distinctive timbre of his voice and the width of his range were equally remarkable.With the opening Sree varnam in Adi tala,  he   set the tone for a memorable evening.  The pleasant Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Seethamma Mayamma&#8217; in Vasantham, Roopaka tala, was presented in an easy flow. The niraval was at &#8216;Dhara Nija Bhagavatagrey.&#8217; Mohanam, the next raga, was introduced with a fair amount of elaboration.The composition was also a Tyagaraja kriti, &#8216;Evarura Ninu Vina,&#8217; set to Chapu, which is essentially a plea to Lord Rama, &#8216;Who is there besides you, for my refuge?&#8217; All the characteristics of this mesmerising raga were subtly revealed. The artiste began with the base notes and meticulously built up the fabric of Mohanam.The violin pieces were brilliant for their innovation. &#8216;Anuraga Muleni,&#8217; composed by Tyagaraja in Saraswathi, Roopaka tala,  was a quick and refreshing piece on the worship of the divine, personified.Then the artiste  progressed to the major raga Varali. The progression  was grand and befitting the solemn Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Eti Janmamidi,&#8217; set to Chapu tala, where the devotee complains about his life without the Lord. The niraval and ingenious manodharma swaras took off from the line &#8216;Sagara Shayanuni.&#8217; Once again the violin dominated, taking on the feature of vocals.&#8216;Manasuloni Marmamunu&#8217; was sung in Shudha Hindolam and sounded and felt different from its more popular version in Hindolam. The artiste  sang a scholarly ragam-thanam-pallavi in Karaharapriya. His deep and rich voice did full justice to the lower sthayi alapanam.The tanam was rhythmic and had variety. The pallavi was the single line, &#8216;Rama Nee Samana Evaru&#8217; taken from the Tyagaraja kirtanam. It was sung at prescribed speeds and was adequately elaborate.  However, the taniavartanam was far from remarkable  with the violin outweighing the vocal at times.Towards the end of the concert, Tygarajan sang a soothing Lali (lullaby) in Neelambari, an appropriate choice, since the raga has an undulating motion. The recital concluded with &#8216;Vinayakuni&#8217; in Madhyamavathi, set to Adi tala.Tyagarajan is a worthy successor of his legendary namesake, both in terms of knowledge and execution. He said that he had been inspired by the pancharatna kirtanas,  sung during  the Guruvayur Chembai Festival to select only Tyagaraja compositions for this concert.The accompanying artistes were Mahadeva Sharma (violin), K.V.Prasad (mridangam) and Vaikom Gopalakrishnan (ghatam). This concert was held in Thrissur under the aegis of  Rasikapriya. The &#8216;singing priest,&#8217;  Paul Poovathingal was also felicitated
