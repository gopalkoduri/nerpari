VB. RamadeviThe centuries old `dasara padagalu' wore modern attire as 13-year-old Master Anirudh presented them on the keyboard, set to lively tunes at Sri Raghavendraswamy Mrithika Brindavan, Nitya Nagar, Salem. With the child-like smile typical of his age, he enjoyed the music that came out of his keyboard as much as the audience did. Anirudh began impressively with "Vaathaapi ganapathim bhajeham." "Ganapathi enna paaliso," "Raama raama endhare," "Madhwaraaya manayolu" and "Kaiya thoro, karunigalarase" were some of the lively numbers he presented vocally along with his mother Jamuna, who also happens to be his first guru.He played many songs but set to different tunes, the audience could not identify.  An announcement of details would have enhanced the enjoyment. Bharat on the flute and Sandeep on the tabla were very confident and extended great support.With his chaste Kannada, impeccable stage manners and superbly modulated voice, Raichur Seshagiri Das won the hearts of the audience on the last day of the programme.After paying his obeisance to the Pitamaha of Carnatic music with "Guru Purandara daasare," Seshagiri proceeded to present "Endhu kaambeno Pandurangana" (Jagannaatha dasa).Jubilant vein"Teraneri meradhu baruva" on Raghavendra Swamy was in a jubilant vein. He  sang a Tamil song "Thunga nadhi theera guru raja" (of course with a Kannada accent) to the delight of the audience. "Enaiyaaro ninage Hanumantharaaya" listed out the devout exploits of Lord Hanuman. The song was a thing of beauty and was a pleasure to listen to.Purandara Dasa's "Budhi maathu helidhare kela bekamma" was enjoyed by the young and old.The judicious blend of Carnatic and Hindustani made Seshagiri Das's music programme very lively and enjoyable.He was ably assisted on the tabla by Gopala Hande and on the harmonium by Prahalada.Bottom Template Starts
