VM. BALAGANESSINMUSICAL HOMAGE: Bombay Jayashri Ramnath.   Photo: R. Ashok.The Sheik Chinna Moulana Memorial Trust in Tiruchi City, in collaboration with the Rasika Ranjana Sabha, recently organised a vocal concert in memory of the late Moulana, noted nagaswaram maestro.`Bombay' Jayashri Ramnath presented the concert to the accompaniment of V.V.S.Murari on the violin, Manoj Siva on the mridangam and Rajagopalan on the morsing.Judicious choiceNo tribute to the late Moulana would have paralleled  Jayashri's performance, as she meticulously chose some of the kirtanas and songs which were popularised by him. Her style of handling ragas kept the audience charged with awe and interest all through. But, more interesting was her main piece, `Dasaradhi' in Todi, which reminded the music lovers of the late Moulana's hard efforts for the realisation of this raga, dear to his heart and soul. Equally impressive was Muthuswami Dikshitar's kirtana in Neelambari (`Amba Neelayadakshi'), another favourite of the late Moulana.The other important songs  were:  `Karunanidhiyae Thayae' in Bowli by Papanasam Sivan, Dikshitar's `Mamava Meenakshi' in Varali, a Meera bhajan in memory of the late M.S.Subbulakshmi and a tillana in Desh.Trustee Kasim, a grandson of the late Moulana said the memorial concert was one of the annual programmes organised to pay homage to his grandfather. The other activities of the trust include identifying talented  up and coming musicians and honouring senior artistes living in penury.Bottom Template Starts
