VThat virutham (singing devotional verses or shlokas in one or more ragas with spontaneous improvisations without a set tala pattern) effectively serves as a powerful tool to convey strong messages was proved by two highly talented Chennai-based sisters the other day during their concert at Sree Swaminatha Swami Seva Samaj, popularly known as the Malai Mandir. Ranjani and Gayathri, who gave a concert during the Sree Skanda Shasthi celebrations, presented two verses from the Kandar Alankaram and one from the Kandan Anuboothi composed by Saint Arunagirinathar. While Gayathri presented the alankarams in ragas Kamboji and Behag, Ranjani presented the anuboothi in the raga Brindavana Saranga. They interwove their manodharma skills and brought both the powerful messages contained in these devotional verses and the features of these ragas to the fore.Flight delay coupled with traffic restrictions due to US President Obama's arrival in the Capital led to the delayed start of the concert. Ranjani and Gayathri dashed off to present Dikshitar's &#8220;Swaminatha&#8221; in raga Nattai culminating with crisp swaraprastaras. However, they could have waited for their violin accompanist to tune his instrument. As a result, he could join in only after they had completed the pallavi and moved on to the anupallavi portion of the composition. While presenting Tyagaraja's &#8220;Gnanamosagarada&#8221; in raga Poorvikalyani the duo's creative talents came to the fore once again. Ranjani in her delineation brought out the features of this raga in stages. Subsequent neraval and swaraprastaras by the duo were delightful.Though their concert was not a thematic one, the sisters constantly presented songs composed in praise of Lord Muruga or Kartikeya . While presenting Periyasami Tooran's &#8220;Orarumugane&#8221; in raga Reeti Gowla and Papanasam Sivan's &#8220;Chittam irangada&#8221; in Sahana, Ranjani and Gayathri brought out the emotive contents of these lyrics. The fast paced composition of Harikesanallur Muthaiah Baghavatar &#8220;Saravana bhava&#8221; in raga Pasupatipriya was lively.As their central piece the siblings once again chose a composition of Papanasam Sivan but a very rarely heard &#8220;Kundramkudikonda Velava&#8221; in raga Todi. This time it was Gayathri who sang a fine alap, bringing out the features of the raga. The neraval of the phrase &#8220;Undhan pugzhal kanavilum oru ganamum marandirunariyene&#8221; and the subsequent swaraprastaras received adequate treatment.Ranjani and Gayathri were ably assisted by Mysore Srikanth on the violin, Neyveli Skanda Subramanian on the mridangam and K.G. Gopalakrishnan on the kanjira. Srikanth's takes on ragas Poorvikalyani and Todi. The tani avartanam (percussion solo) by Subramanian and Gopalakrishnan in Adi tala was captivating.S. Sowmya's performance during this festival was lacklustre, partly due to the not-so-pleasing audio system in the initial phases. Sowmya's central item was Tyagaraja's &#8220;O Rangasayee&#8221; in raga Kamboji. Earlier, she also presented Tyagaraja's &#8220;Brovabharama&#8221; in raga Bahudari in a somewhat detailed manner. Though she presented a fine alap of this raga and swara formats rich in creativity, the presentation of the composition as such was uninspiring. While R.K. Shreeramkumar on the violin provided good support, Neyveli Narayanan on the mridangam and K.G. Gopalakrishnan played a riveting tani avartanam in Adi tala.
