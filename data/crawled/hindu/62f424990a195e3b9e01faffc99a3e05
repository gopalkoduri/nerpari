VThe Surutti edifice was built with madhyamakala passages. Akara as the predominant form of expression lent impetus to lengthy interlinked chains of prayogas encircling the panchama. These were punctuated by concise observations and supple jarus that lent contrast.The violinist, M.A. Sundareswaran chose to open his alapana innings with a phrase echoing the commencing line of &#8216;Sri Venkatagirisam,&#8217; thus ensuring a definitive statement of Surutti and second-guessing the main artist, whose choice of kriti indeed turned out to be this Muthuswami Dikshitar masterpiece.The kalapramana adopted was particularly effective - a wonderfully relaxed pace carried forward into the niraval at &#8216;Alamelu Manga Sametham&#8217; where kizhkala niraval perceptively made the most of karvai opportunities that soothed.The prolonged melkala niraval and the rousing melkala kalpanaswaras sustained pace and interest without resorting to overtly spectacular special effects.The vocalist&#8217;s penchant for weighty kritis again manifested in his choice of Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Ranganayakam&#8217; (Nayaki), the flowing rendition firmly anchored by Mannargudi N. Subramanian&#8217;s precise time-keeping on the mridangam. The vocalist displayed outstanding resonance in the mandrasthayi elaboration of Varali raga.A continual rain of untiring medium-fast passages issued from the panchama and the tara sthayi shadja, slowing to a drizzle in the concluding phase.Another Muthuswami Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Seshachala Nayakam&#8217; took centrestage, with niraval at &#8216;Aravindapatra Nayanam.&#8217;The kuraippu centred at the shadja took on the eduppu of &#8216;Aravinda,&#8217; which was also the idam for the thani.M.A.Sundareswaran, very much in sync with the vocalist, came up with spontaneous repartees in Surutti and Varali.A visibly enthused Mannargudi N. Subramanian&#8217;s mridangam and H. Sivaramakrishnan&#8217;s ghatam combined to produce a fine tani avartanam marked by clarity of sollus.A Vadiraja composition in Yamuna Kalyani and a tillana in Sindhu Bhairavi preceded by a pleasing line-up of ragas in the sloka &#8216;Sri Ramam&#8217;- Sindhu Bhairavi, Kaapi, Ranjani, Sahana, Hindolam, Shanmukhapriya, Begada and Hamsanandi - tapped into melodic wellsprings.Earlier items included &#8216;Subramanyena&#8217; (Suddha Dhanyasi, Muthuswami Dikshitar) and &#8216;Narayana Enniro&#8217; (Hamsadhwani).
