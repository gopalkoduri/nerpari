VS.S. SAMBASIVAMC.N.K. Murthy, a promising flautist, performed recently for Rasikapriya at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Hall in Kochi. Murthy started the concert with the  popular Bhairavi Ata tala varnam `Viribhoni' by Pachimiriam Adiappa. The piece highlighted the flautist's  mastery over the instrument.  The second piece was Muthuswamy Dikshitar's `Vathapi Ganapathim Bhaje,' in Hamsasdhwani set to Adi tala. The selection and order of songs rendered helped maintain the concert's tempo. Swati Tirunal's `Sri Rajarajeshwari' in Janaranjani followed the piece `Entaro Mahanubhavulu' of Tyagaraja.The next piece was Swati Tirunal's `Pahimam Sri Rajarajeshwari' in Janaranjani, played in the medium tempo. This was well received by the audience.In harmonyThe harmony between the vocalist and accompanying artistes such as Edapally Ajithkumar (violin), Balakrishna Kamath (flute), Venugopal (ghatom) and Madhusoodanan (morsing) enhanced the aesthetic appeal of the concert.  `Sobillu Sapthaswara' of Tyagaraja in Jaganmohini raga highlighted the acumen of the accompanists.Simendramadhyamam needs the touch of an expert  since it is very close to Keeravani. Justice was done to the raga with a brief exploration followed by the kriti `Ninne nammithinayya' by Mysore Vasudevacharya. It was ornamented by an interesting  pattern of kalpanaswaras.Tyagaraja's `Nenarunchinanu' in Malavi  added spice to the concert with its fast beat. The main piece for the evening was Tyagaraja's `Chakkani Raja' in Karaharapriya, set to Adi tala.The percussionist performed a brief but soothing thaniavarthanam with well-constructed muthaippus. It was followed by Thudukas.Purandaradasa's `Venkatachala Nilayam' in Sindhu Bhairavi was rendered with bhakti bhava. The other concluding pieces were Dhanashree raga thillana of Swati Tirunal and Purandaradasa's `Sri Raga devarnama Baghyada lakshmi baramma.'A little more intricacy in raga exploration and the right opportunities, should see C.N.K. Murthy going places.Bottom Template Starts
