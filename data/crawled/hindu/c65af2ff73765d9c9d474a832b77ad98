VHARISH BALThis was Madurai T.N. Seshagopalan's first concert in Kochi after being awarded the Sangeeta Kalanidhi.  The concert's highlight was some select ragas and compositions that were enriched by his majestic voice  and singing of virutham.TNS has a penchant for starting his concerts with Ada tala varnams in his own stately inimitable style. He did the same here with a short slokam in Kanada raga followed by `Neranammi,' which had detailedkalpanaswaras.Clear and preciseThis was followed by `Raramainti' in Asaveri. With no ambiguity, he brought out the swaroopa of Poorvikalyani right from the first phrase. His briga shareeram started unfurling numerous phrases with great clarity.`Sarasasamadana' in Kapinarayani, which is often rendered as an interim piece,  was embellished by TNS with his own sangatis and swaras. His Varali rendition and virutham showed shades of the Harikatha performer in him. The passion and long sustenance at the dramatic points in the high notes is quite characteristic of this style. His brigas that came in long intervals were sung with marvellous breath control. The Papanasam Sivan composition `Ka va va' in this raga was received well.Tanjavur Murugabhoopathi's resonant  mridangam was tuned to the lively rhythm of the concert.  The vocalist started from the mantra sthayi for his Kambhoji alaapana and even touched the `nishadam' of the atimantra sthayi. He went for a structured elaborate  exposition of the raga.  Dikshitar's `Subramanyaya Namaste,' opulent with raga bhava, was rendered at a languid pace. Same swaras were treated to different rhythmic patterns, which gave a new feel to the singing of swaras at that point.Kottayam Unnikrishnan (ghatom) and Trivandrum Rajagopal (kanjeera) were the other percussionists who kept the short but vigorous thani spontaneous and lively. `Chediyai vinai theerthu' was a virutham that combined Reethigowla, Saveri, Darbari Kanada and Hamsanandi. The concert was organised by Mali Foundation and Rasikapriya at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Kochi.Bottom Template Starts
