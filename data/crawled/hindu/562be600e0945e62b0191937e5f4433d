VIf GNB&#8217;s music was light-years ahead of its time, Sriram&#8217;s music, by reason of his chosen style, is in the process of emerging from a time warp, caught between idealism and nostalgia on the one hand, and the demands of current trends in musical expression on the other. Today, it is for both listeners and the artiste to look beyond stylistic manifestations to the degree of the artiste&#8217;s emerging self-expression.In his vocal recital under the auspices of Shanmukhapriya, there was sufficient individuality of concept to personalise a concise essay of Shama which took its cue from the serenity inherent in Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Shantamulekha.&#8217; The subtle approach and nuanced handling of the rishabha afforded a glimpse into the natural instincts of the artiste behind the performer. As well, the kizhkala swaraprasthara came alive with meaningful phrasing.The Pantuvarali alapana relied on panchama-varja passages and an extended sojourn at the tara sthayi shadja suite to create interest. The Bhadrachala Ramadas composition &#8216;Ennagaanu Rama Bhajana&#8217; was followed up with kalpanaswara, the culminating round structured for highly dramatic effect.The main piece was a ragam-tanam-pallavi in Shanmukhapriya, a raga which holds untold possibilities for exploring bhava. Though passages graced by jarus did surface occasionally, the artiste&#8217;s leaning towards a predominantly scalar delineation detracted from melodic content and smooth continuity of narrative. The violinist endeavoured to shift the focus to melody and his version would have made a better mark had it been more compact. The robust tanam was succeeded by a neatly executed pallavi &#8216;Neeraja dala netra maara komalagaatra&#8217; (Misra chapu) rounded off with ragamalika swaras.  Tonal vigour was in evidence from the start, with &#8216;Sri Padmanabham&#8217; (Nattai) and attendant kalpanaswaras making an appreciable impact.Fluidity and grace marked V. Sanjeev&#8217;s expositions on the violin. Kalpanaswara exchanges were handled with aplomb. With veteran vidwan Mannargudi Easwaran&#8217;s soft sure touch on the mridangam leading the way, what more could the main artiste ask for? His keen sense of aesthetics and uncanny anticipation paired with E.M. Subramaniam&#8217;s expertise on the ghatam ensured a powerful percussive base that supported the concert and a tani avartanam that held rasikas in rapt attention.
