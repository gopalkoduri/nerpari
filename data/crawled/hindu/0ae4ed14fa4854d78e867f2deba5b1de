VWhat can be said  about  Tyagaraja that has not already been said? Thiruvali-Thirunagari Embar Chinthamani Kasturi seemed to have realised it  and hence  adopted a novel  approach to narrate the saga of the saint. Surely it was one of the most moving discourses, which exhorted  the next generation singers to follow the ideals of Tyagaraja. The musical narrative  was organised by the Sadguru Gana Nilayam, at Sri Tyagaraja Hall, West Mambalam, recently.The quality performance gave  rise to the hope that &#8216;Bhakthi&#8217; music propounded by Tyagaraja could once again reach the standard of the late 1940s and 50s, when pure devotion, not pomp,  dominates the music stage.No matter which way one looks at it &#8212; Harikatha or music concert &#8212; the discourse worked  beautifully. Embar Kasturi warned of the dangers of separating  devotion from music and sent out the  message  that Tyagaraja kritis sung without devotion will be meaningless. &#8220;It is the saint&#8217;s devotion to Lord Rama that has, over the years, attracted even people who do not know Telugu to sing his kritis,&#8221; he said. What is important  is Tyagaraja&#8217;s devotion to Lord Rama and what it means to the world. &#8220;Sainthood has been conferred on Tyagaraja only for his devotion to Lord Rama,&#8221; he said.Tyagaraja&#8217;s birth, marriage,  induction into the Rama Taraka Mantra and the first song composed by him on Lord Rama (&#8216;Namo Namo Raghavya&#8217;) were events  Kasturi touched upon. But  the  focus was on the saint&#8217;s kritis.Embar Kasturi followed Tyagaraja&#8217;s tradition meticulously and blended with it the Srivaishnavite sampradaya. He was supported by Anaiyampatti G. Venkatasubramanian (violin) and Sethalapatti B. Ganapathyraman (mridangam).
