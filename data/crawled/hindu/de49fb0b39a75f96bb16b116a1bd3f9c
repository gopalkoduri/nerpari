VMala Chandrashekhar played flute under the auspices of Ramabhyudaya Sabha as part of Ramanavami celebrations in Mysore. Nalina Mohan (violin), Jayachandra Rao (mridanga) and M.R. Manjunath accompanied.She started with Dikshitar's &#8220;Mahaganapathim&#8221; (Naata) followed by Thyagaraja's &#8220;Banturithikolu&#8221; (Hamsanadha), embellishing both with a few strains of kalpanaswaras, more as a formality than as a gesture of intuitive creativity. Both these numbers gave tenable indications as to her ability in melodically blowing the instrument rather than infusing into it inspiring artistry.In spite of further progressions, there was no sign of alapana or such things: four more followed one after another: &#8220;Endaro Mahanubhavulu&#8221; (Shri-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Bhaavayaami&#8221; (Ragamalika-Swathi Thirunal), &#8220;Naatimaata&#8221; (Devakriya-Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Ramachandram Bhaavayaami&#8221; (Vasantha-Dikshithar).With the inclusion of two lengthy compositions (bland narration) rendered in succession, the concert naturally turned dreary running without any charm for favourable attention; of course, an indication of perfunctory planning.Further, it was hard to decipher what advantage the accomplished flautist was deriving by frequently referring to notes. Was it not hindering her imaginative extempore, may be, with every probability of a substitution? Such observations may appear as unfounded conjectures; yet, natural under the present circumstance.&#8220;Dayarani&#8221; (Mohana-Thyagaraja) was simply plain and &#8220;Rama Rama Gunaseema&#8221; (Simhendramadhyama -Swathi Thirunal) tread more or less the same track though appended with a few airs of alapana and swarakalpana sections. Alapana sections were more like overtures than any that projected personalities of those ragas.As if to substantiate the above remarks, followed four more in quick succession: &#8220;Krishna Ni Begane&#8221; (Yaman-Vyasarayaru), &#8220;Bhavayeham Raghuveeram&#8221; (Behag-Vasudevacharya), &#8220;Tamburi Meetidava&#8221; (Sindhubhairavi-Purandaradasa) and &#8220;Laliyugave&#8221; (Nilambari-Thyagaraja).Malladi Brothers sang under the auspices of Shri Prasanna Sitharama Mandira as part of Ramanavami Music Festival. Ramanujacharya (violin), K.V. Prasad (mridanga) and Phanindra (ghata) accompanied.By virtue of rich resonating and consistent voices, the concert was melodious, and scholarly progressions rendered it attractive.The singers elaborated Chakravaka (&#8220;Etula Brothuvo Theliya&#8221;-Thyagaraja) systematically, and the very tranquilising mood of the raga, which also has in it an element of pathos, added emotive shades to the section.Measured articulations with appropriate pauses spanned over the necessary three octaves defining the finer features with exactitude. Such a melodic air rightly prepared the audience to enjoy the composition of humble admission and submission.However, the swarakalpana section could not complement this general mood.The development took a different path, wherein the singer's brilliant display of scholarship took precedence over the composer's humility ingrained in the composition.Raga (Gamanashrama)-tana-pallavi (&#8220;Rama Raghukulasoma&#8221;) as is usual, spoke more of proficiency than of pleasing experience: more of a metrical intricacy than of an analytical exposition of the import. Ragalapana by both the lead artistes and the violinist made great impact. The swarakalpana was in ragamalika.&#8220;Kamadhenukam Ashraye&#8221; (Dhenuka &#8212; in praise of Kamadhenu for a divine cause, music composed by Malladi Suri Babu), &#8220;Kamalapthakula&#8221; (Brindavani-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Shri Ramam&#8221; (Narayanagaula - Dikshithar) and &#8220;Raavayya Bhadrachala&#8221; (Anandabhairavi-Bhadrachala Ramadas) were other highlights sung admirably and emotively.
