VCarnatica BrothersSrishti.s carnatica P Ltd.Devotional CD (Price: Rs. 125)It is heartening that the music of the young vocal duo,  K.N.Sashikiran and P.Ganesh, reflects their having absorbed many finer aspects of great vidwans. Their robust and strong voices mix well and yet provide a refreshing contrast.In this compact disc the brothers have chosen the Andolika varnam (&#8216;Needayarada&#8217;) of the legendary G.N.Balasubramanian as the opening number. This varnam is an apt curtain raiser to the fare which follows. One of the most moving compositions of Tyagaraja, &#8216;Teliyaleru Rama&#8217; in Dhenuka with a spate of kalpanaswaras is rendered with the contours of the melody not being trespassed with. The Bowli creation of Uthukadu Venkata Kavi &#8216;Kshanameva&#8217; is not often heard and is sung with an appropriate lilt by the vocalists and is a refreshing number.Amongst the various compositions of Tyagaraja in Sriranjani, &#8216;Brochevarevare&#8217; stands out due to its different structure which amply reflects the musical genius of the bard. This rendition is vigorous and the solfa passages for the opening lyric as well as for &#8216;Raghupathe&#8217; stand testimony to the innovative bent of mind of the artists.Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s Kannada masterpiece &#8216;Sri Mathrubhutham&#8217; in praise of Thayumanaswamy of the Rockfort temple at Tiruchirapalli, is sung true to the patanthara of T.Brinda. The brief raga alapana of Kannada which precedes the song rendition is in accordance with the largely accepted grammar of the melody. The solfa passages are rendered at &#8216;Suvasitha Nava Javanthi,&#8217; which is an Adhitha eduppu and falls at one mathra before samam. These are presented with a great degree of confidence and arrive with pin point precision.The brothers do well to present one of M. M. Dandapani Desigar&#8217;s compositions, &#8216;Ennai Nee Maravade&#8217; in a captivating Amrithavarshini, which in recent times has been presented as captivatingly by their sibling N.Ravikiran on the Chitra veena. This song comes as a refreshing breeze to the generally overworked &#8216;Sudhamayi&#8217; of Muthaiah Bagavathar in the current concert scenario.Thepiece de resistanceof this disc is Tyagaraja&#8217;s Saramathi krithi &#8216;Mokshamugaladha.&#8217; The vinyasa of Saramathi by Sashikiran is a careful one without deviating from the raga lakshana and is praiseworthy. The sarvalaghu swaras are competently rendered for the pallavi. The violinist V.V.Ravi&#8217;s portrayal of Saramathi has a silken finish and falls very pleasantly on the ear. Percussive accompaniment provided on the mridangam by Thiruvarur Vaidyanathan reflects his sangeetha gnanam and his familiarity with the compositions that have been sung. Vaidhyanathan offers a crisp Mohra Korvai at the conclusion of &#8216;Mokshamugaladha.&#8217;A beautiful Thamizh padam of Vaithiswarankovil Subbarama Iyer in Sahana &#8216;Ini Enna,&#8217; portraying the feelings of a Kanditha nayika is a raga bhava-laden rendition. The concluding Javali in Behag &#8216;Samayamidhe&#8217; is soothing and the voice modulation of the artists reminds one of John Higgins&#8217; presentation of this javali. While singing words like &#8216;Mathrubhutham,&#8217; &#8216;Sametham,&#8217; etc., in the Kannada song it is essential that the lips of the singer meet, as otherwise the vocalisation sounds like &#8216;Mathrubhuthau&#8217; and &#8216;Samethau.&#8217; This point could be given a thought to by the talented duo.
