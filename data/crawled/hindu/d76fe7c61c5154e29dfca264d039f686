VBhramara Trust of Y.T. and Madhuri Thathachari, Mysore, bestowed Bharatha Rathna M.S. Subbulakshmi Award on two young classical singers, H.K. Tanmayi and A.K. Jagadish, who later presented recitals proving their competence.On this occasion, the Trust presented Prof. Y.T. Thathachari Prestigious Research Award for Science to Prof. Bishnu Pada Pal (Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi) and Prof. Sambasivarao Kotha (Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai), for their outstanding contribution in the field of Science. Jagadguru Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Mahaswamiji of Suttur Math graced the occasion.A.K. Jagadish sings with verve and vitality, his voice easily spanning the octaves. Nevertheless, it was evident that had he improved the chest register, the chords would have gained better resonance and the expressions pleasing and impressive.Moreover, attention given to the lyrical aspects was inadequate, and this was noticed in both &#8220;Raara Maayintidaaka&#8221; (Asaveri &#8211; Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Marakatalingam&#8221; (Vasantha-Dikshithar). An introductory alapana in Asaveri and a few strains of kalpanaswaras featured Thyagaraja's composition.The focus of the concert was raga (Hemavathi), taana and pallavi (&#8220;Jagannatha Sahithe&#8221;). More than import of the lyrics the technical aspects received more attention.With such an approach, the expatiation of the lyrical sections suffered jerky progressions, which even gave a jolt to the flow. The young, dedicated singer could have avoided such trips, had he followed a simpler and majestic path with care and composure. swaraprastara was in ragamalika &#8212; Lathangi and Begade.***Tanmayee's approach was more or less similar. This young vocalist started her concert with &#8220;Paalinchu Kamakshi&#8221; (Madhyamavati - Shyamashastri). Her voice is bold and is capable of infusing the necessary life into the compositions; nevertheless, it sounds harsh which is perhaps the result of unnecessary exertion.It is painful to see such young talented artistes singing without any heed to the general diction, meaning and melody.They are under the illusion that complicated articulation is strength and demonstration of rhythm proficiency is a mark of competency &#8211; a tendency that mars the tonal quality, mauls the lyrical grandeur, finally spoiling both tuneful flow and absorbing expressions.Observe how this potentially good and innocent singer, not being amply corrected and meticulously shaped, distorted the lyrics by accentuating on &#8216;vi' syllable of the text &#8220;Ponditivi Kaarunyamuthivai&#8221;, which now sounded as &#8220;Ponditi Vikarunyamurthivai&#8221;, while expatiating (neraval) the charana, &#8220;Kanthamagu Peru&#8221; ( in Paalinchu Kamakshi).Focus of the concert was raga (Bhairavi), taana and pallavi (&#8220;Sari Evaramma&#8221; in Bhairavi). Swaraprastara passed through Saama and Purvikalyani. H.N. Smitha (violin) and Radhesh (mridanga) accompanied.
