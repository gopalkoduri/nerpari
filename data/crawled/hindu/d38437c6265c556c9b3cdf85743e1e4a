VIt is  ironical that while the ageing process confers refined richness of maturity on a musician, expression wise the artist, often, is unable to live up to it.   Bombay Sisters, Saroja and Lalitha, however, overcame  this dichotomy to present a plea\u000asant picture in their concert for Sri Krishna Gana Sabha&#8217;s  Purandara Dasa Day celebrations.The great composer has outlined the bedrock of our Vedic culture in every sahitya with angelic strength. But rasikas in Chennai could hardly be inspired by them because of the barrier in the language &#8212; only the raga alapana could be enjoyed.In this context, how have Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, with their songs in Telugu and Sanskrit stolen the hearts of listeners? It is mainly because the Trinity&#8217;s compositions over the decades were sung again and again in concerts, thus endearing themselves to the  listeners.To cite a few instances, Ariyakkudi Ramanuja Iyengar included in many of his kutcheries &#8216;Seshachalanayakam&#8217; (Varali), &#8216;Sri Subramanyaya Namasthe,&#8217;(Khambodi), &#8216;Dasarathe&#8217; (Thodi) and others.  Semmangudi Sinivasa Iyer &#8216;Ksheenamai&#8217; (Mukhari) &#8216;Pankajalochana&#8217; (Kalyani) of Swati Tirunal and M.S. Subbulakshmi &#8216;Akhilandeswari&#8217; (Dwijavanti) &#8216;Mayamma&#8217; (Ahiri) &#8216;Sri Sankaracharyam&#8217; (Sankarabharanam). D.K. Jayaraman and Seshagopalan have sung &#8216;Ranganayakam&#8217; (Nayaki) and Alathur Brothers &#8216;Endundi Vedali Tivo&#8217; (Durbar) and &#8216;Mari Mari Ninne&#8217; (Khambodi). The disciples are following the tradition.In contrast, Purandara Dasa is less familiar  for two reasons. One, Kannada is not widely spoken in Chennai as Telugu or Sanskrit through slokas, ashtotrams, etc. Secondly, there is no well established  song structure. Some sing them as light music and some other musicians choose their own raga and kirtana patantara for the same song.One aspect deserves notice. Ariyakkudi used to sing the Kannada songs &#8216;Nambikkettavar Illalo&#8217; (Kalyani) and &#8216;Kandu Danyana&#8217; (Behag). These have now gone out of vogue, whereas &#8216;Jagaddo Darana&#8217; (Kapi) with its fixed kirtana structure is still enjoyed by rasikas. For a song in a different language, familiarity can be achieved only by musicians including it in their concerts frequently with a fixed raga and kirtana patantara.Bombay Sisters sang &#8216;Palita Ninava Sri Mahalakshmi&#8217; in Khamas, &#8216;Hanumanta Deva Namo&#8217; (Purivikalyani) &#8216;Naanenu Madideno&#8217; (Mohanam) and &#8216;Ninne Nodi Dhanyanadeno&#8217; (Thodi). As said earlier, the kirtana passed over rasikas&#8217; heads.  Only the alapana of Purvikalyani by Lalita, and Thodi by Saroja elaborated methodically and in great detail appealed. So, the  divinity of Purandaradasa and the sangita of the Bombay Sisters stood out.Violinist Usha Rajagopalan and  percussion artists B. Ganapatiram (mridangam) and H. Sivaramakrishnan (ghatam)  made up an enlivening team.
