VLALITHAA KRISHNANAmritha Venkatesh has a well-equipped arsenal that she exploited to the hilt in her concert for the Sarvani Sangeetha Sabha. A sturdy, malleable voice, open-throated singing and a firm grip on the essentials were all pressed into service for optimum results. If the number of items chosen was limited, it was a deliberate move that left her free to explore the ebb and flow of the energies of two ragas &#151;  Kalyani and Saveri &#151;  at leisure.A steady pace and orderly progress marked the course of the Kalyani alapana. While there was no dearth of emphatic pidis, the accent was more on azhuttam than free-flowing melody. The middle register abounded with a series of long-winded phrases in quick succession. The principle of highlighting by contrast would have worked very well here &#151;  the longer phrases would have gained in value if they had been juxtaposed with shorter, more concise statements. Syama Sastri's ``Biraana Varaalichi" (Adi, tisra nadai) was elaborated with swaraprasthara and neraval at Shamakrishna sodari. A spirited ``Bhogindra saayinam" (Swathi Tirunal) in Kuntalavarali, followed.Armed with convictionIt was in the central piece, Saveri, that the artiste struck gold. Armed with conviction and confidence, she chose to take a road less travelled. Fired with the resolve to bring her considerable efforts to fruition, she infused her sancharas with a rare passion. Intention translated into lofty expression. Unity of concept linked ideas in a continuous stream. Passages pulsating with energy were underlaid with a fine tracery of subtle detailing.Muthuswami Dikshitar's heavyweight composition, ``Sri Rajagopalam" resonated with bhava, with the neraval at Dhiraagraganya doing ample justice to the kizhkalam. Again, in the kalpanaswaras, the emphasis was on bhava, the permutations and kuraippu exploring variegated shades alternating between pa and ma.A rivulet of melody coursed through the Behaag-Kapi-Hamsanandi ragamalika prelude to the Purandasa composition in Hamsanandi. ``Muddugare Yashoda" (Kurinji) and tillana in Khamas were the concluding pieces.In Amritha Murali (violin) and Ganapathy Raman (mridangam), the young artiste had enthusiastic peer support. Amritha presented a graceful Kalyani and a dignified Saveri. Ganapathy Raman played with keen anticipation and his tani avartanam was enlivened by sparkling nadais.Bottom Template Starts
