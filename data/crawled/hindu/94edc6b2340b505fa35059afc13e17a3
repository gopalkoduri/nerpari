VThe Hindi term &#8216;Gharana' can be split into &#8220;Ghar &#8220;(home) and &#8220;aana&#8221; (to come). The Gharanas have been passed from home to home and generation to generation. While this is true of Hindustani Music (HM), Carnatic Music's (CM) gurukula system of learning needs no special introduction as the handing over of knowledge and its communication have been done by living gurus and not through manuscripts.Making such constructive comparisons between the two thoughts of music, violinist Dr. Narmadha stressed (initially and finally) that Hindustani and Carnatic music are like &#8220;the two eyes of Bharatha Matha and belonged to a vibrant single tree which has these as its branches&#8221;.As a preparatory exercise to better understand her hour-long presentation, &#8216;Comparative Study of Indian Music,' Narmadha traced the elements of Carnatic and Hindustani music: Their origin and evolution, the raga-groups and set patterns (Paddhathi) in existence, intervals between swaras, the Melakartha system (CM), the Ten Dhat system (HM), the kritis (CM) that format the raga's beauty, the nomenclatures and how the method of teaching in Hindustani music is like a sancharam - to cite a few.She also quoted from Professor Sambamurthi and Dilip Chandra to substantiate and support her narrations.She said that Carnatic music compositions are bhakti-based (with some exceptions), whereas Hindustani music has adopted amorous themes too.Multi-lingual lyricsCarnatic music's lyrics are also multi-lingual with Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and even Sanskrit. A musician makes a representative inclusion of these compositions in a single concert.In Hindustani music there is a different charm, where the performers sing the same line repeatedly and the tabla player provides the zestfully paced nadais and tekas with their gentle nuances.Carnatic music has its established characteristic gamakas in the same swarasthana; playing pure notes is restricted to a few compositions only. Hindustani music's alap, jod and jhala are meant for and used by instrumentalists, not vocalists, she added.Javali and ThumriThumri (HM) travels in a different trajectory and Carnatic music's dance-based padams and javalis could be seen as its counterpart. Thumri presents a visual where the &#8220;thumaku thumaku&#8221; (and hence thumri!) that is heard belongs to the gopis dancing around Krishna, their hero. The Dhrupad, larger in length shed some of its traits, to become the Khyal with its sthayi and antara, she noted. There is then the obvious variation of the laya accompaniment - the tabla (HM) or the mridangam (CM). Each is played in its own way to mesh with the music that is rendered. Hindustani music's talam is exclusively in the &#8220;hands&#8221; of the tabla player; and the main artist in Carnatic music plays his part by maintaining the &#8220;hand-talam.&#8221; (Instrumentalists use their feet).This lec-dem was part of the Music Festival of Chennai Fine Arts (8th year), &#8216;Vaggeyakara Vaibhavam and Vishesha Vadyanubhava,' held at Gokhale Sastri Institute, Chennai, and was dedicated to the memory of the late S. Rajam. These sessions need a period of two hours for a semblance of justice to be done to the subject and for the benefit of those avid learners who had assembled there.
