Rajamani (mridangam) and Vazhappally Krishnakumar (ghatam).The opening Bhairavi Adi tala varnam &#8216;Viriboni' in two speeds displayed the Dasavidha gamakas. Dikshitar's &#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam' in Shanmukhapriya, set to Roopaka tala, had lilting swarasancharas. A succinct and unhurried alapana of the vivadhi raga Ganamurthi preceded Tyagaraja's &#8216;Ganamurthe.' Exposition of Lathangi was classical and mellifluous.Judicious selectionSubramanian's judicious selection of compositions, ragas, talas and composers was evident in the concert. &#8216;Marivere,' of Patnam Subramania Iyer, set to Khandha chappu tala, had cascading manodharmaswara. Dikshitar's &#8216;Sri Venkata girishamasraye' in Adi tala led to a ragam-tanam-pallavi in Thodi. The pallavi &#8216;Hare Rama Govindar Murare' was preceded by a neatly woven, rhythmic tanam.Rajamani's deft touches and intricate combinations made the tani a delight to listen to. Krishankumar also rose to the occasion. Rajamani's playing and virtuosity were demonstrative of the unique style of his father, the legendary Palghat Mani Iyer's.Next, came a ragamalika comprising Ananthabhairavi, Saveri, Varali, Sahana, Adhana Behag and Neelambari for Annamachariyar's &#8216;Madhavamamava.'
