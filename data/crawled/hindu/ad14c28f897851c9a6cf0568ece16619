VSVKWhen a judicious selection of songs is rendered with good patanthara, the concert provides satisfaction. Combined with delicate musical instincts and refined expression, it guides an artiste to excellence. Kirtanas are basic building blocks of a perf\u000aormance. The latter demands from a musician conscious striving to achieve the goal. Normally many aspiring young vocalists stop with the first and therefore remain stagnant. It is only when both these features are fused music gains in depth.The recital of Anusha Pradeep for the TTD Information Centre moved on the strength of select songs. In her interpretation she gave importance to authentic sangatis without a trace of casualness.In particular, the presentation of &#8220;Nagumomu&#8221; (Abheri) and &#8220;Evarani&#8221; (Devamritavarshini) were precise compelling attention without any affected vocal modulation. At no time did she aim at the spectacular or demonstrative ingredients but stuck to restraint.There was warmth and sincerity in the way she sang &#8216;Sri-Venkatagirisam&#8217; (Suruti) and &#8216;Paruram-Paarka&#8217; (Dhanyasi with an alapana).The main raga and song effort was Bhairavi &#8216;Upachaaramu&#8217; which brought out her musical resources to the full. At this stage her voice too gained sufficient mobility.The raga alapanas of Dhanyasi, Latangi (Aparaadamula) were correct, but experience has to give her an insight into their subtle graces.In Neela Jayakumar, the vocalist had a good accompanist. Her raga sketches were clean, sharp and smooth. But she had to bow to the erratic behaviour of amplification. V.R.Jayakumar on the mridangam gave the amount of percussive help the vocalist required.Bottom Template Starts
