VSriram Parasuram spoke on the subject, &#8216;The singing violin &#8212; Principles and techniques towards Geethavidhanam or Gayaki on the Violin&#8217; and enlightened listeners as he demonstrated from the Hindustani and the Carnatic school various \u000amethods of singing and employed the violin, as the expert would, to grasp the same tone and tenor.He himself admitted that a one hundred per cent capture of the human voice on the violin would be a dream, a dream worth realising. The voice box has about 30,000 reeds vibrating together whereas the violin has just four.He also showed how different positions of the bow on the violin produce different sounds, and hence the term bow-choreography.There is a high contrast in nadha when the left hand is placed low down on the violin and slightly above. He also showed concepts about bowing that come naturally and forcibly.He also said that due consideration should be given to the many Western concepts relating to the violin while learning and playing.  After all,  violin itself came to us from the Western world.Concepts and styles of playing such as legato, accent, staccato and detache were actually being applied by our musicians and Sriram gave clear examples from our tanam to prove his point. Playing swaras on the same string and using the adjacent string makes so much difference in the quality of the note.The violinist should always bear in mind (or sing within himself) the sahitya of a kriti and the bowing should shadow the breaks that would have been present while rendering the sahitya vocally, he noted.Sriram exquisitely sang and then mirrored the sahitya bhava on the violin, in respect of songs such as &#8216;Veena Pusthaka&#8217; (Vegavahini), &#8216;Mayamma&#8217; (Ahiri) and &#8216;Theliyaleru Rama&#8217; (Dhenuka).He mentioned the vocalists such as Viswa, (T. Viswanathan), MDR, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Parassala Ponnammal, and mentioned how they were engaged in pulling out or drawing out the note and this, he said, makes them ideal musicians.The human voice, he reminded, has been accorded  primacy in our culture, which always looked at things in a holistic way. Music itself is essentially an extension of ourselves not something that is external to us.
