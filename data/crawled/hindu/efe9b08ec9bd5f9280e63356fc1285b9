VThe range of his heavy vocal chords was his additional advantage. While Hindolam essay came as a colourful collage of long and short phrases, Kalyani alapana augmented the traditional raga format with many fine touches, tantalising trajectory and adequate repose. &#8216;Ramanukku Mannan Mudi&#8217; of Arunachala Kavi in Hindolam had the necessary dash with rounds of kalpanaswaras.Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Bhajare rechitha&#8217; was Manimaran&#8217;s pick in Kalyani with extended niraval and swaras centered on &#8216;Devim Sakthi Beejodbhava.&#8217; There was lot of soul and stir that filled the niraval before the follow up of neatly etched kalpanaswaras.Maran has become adept in providing deluges of swaras. Nevertheless,  a little more discretion will be better for him otherwise the long winding final korvais will become flat as empty syllables. This concert at &#8216;Amarabharati&#8217; for Asthika Samajam, Thiruvanmiyur, was quite agile and energetic right from the start.The opening &#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam&#8217; (Chamaram) and &#8216;Orukkal Siva Chidamabaram&#8217; (Arabhi) were steamed up further with speedy &#8216;Tulasi Dala&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla), &#8216;Thaye Tripurasundari&#8217; (Suddha Saveri) and &#8216;Himachala Tanaya&#8217; (Anandabhairavi) preceding and following Hindolam.Sathish Kumar played his role efficiently on the violin but his raga essays could have been a little more elaborate.The percussionists Kudanthai Saravanan (mridangam) and Adambakkam Shankar (ghatam) were injoie de vivrethroughout the concert. The tani avartanam in misrachapu by both Saravanan and Shankar were excellent.
