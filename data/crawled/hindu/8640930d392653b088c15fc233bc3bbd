VSriranjani Santhanagopalan shows promise, and  a  penchant for a cascade of swaras.  In addition, the voice and the rendition  spell the freshness and feisty of youth. Sriranjani&#8217;s mellifluous vocal chords  travel in all the three registers wit\u000ah ease, bringing forth catchy phrases, impressive nuances and a broad picture of the ragas.Nattakurinji varnam, Devamanohari, (&#8216;Kulabirudunu Brochu&#8217; of Tyagaraja), Poorvikalyani (&#8216;Maru Kulaviya&#8217; by Arunagirinathar) heralded a quick build-up  of  tempo in Sriranjani&#8217;s concert at the Raga Sudha Hall for Nada Inbam.The line &#8216;Thirukuravadi Nizhalthanil Uraivonae&#8217; from the  &#8216;Thiruppugazh&#8217; expanded with a stylish niraval backed by swift sets of swaras.The elucidation of Dhanyasi followed with more repose and profundity to suit the Syama Sastri composition, &#8216;Meena Lochana Brova.&#8217; The kriti was sung with piety sans frills, with emphasis on sentiment, which was indeed pleasing. Kanada is melodious, fits into a concert at any point and  and can be qualified with elaboration or brevity. Sriranjani allowed her raga vinyasa to grow  and glow.It became a perfect preface for Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Sri Narada,&#8217; which also followed a serene mode. The conspicuous parts of this kriti were Sriranjani&#8217;s soft framing of swaras with the ascending notes of the arohanam and a winsome wrap up towards the end with intelligent blend of Kanada&#8217;s jeeva swaras.Vachaspati was  the main piece. Here the raga expose went slightly on a faster track but  did not sacrifice  quality. Sriranjani&#8217;s understanding was flawless; but a little more weight on raga delineation and a  check on rapid-fire swara chains can make her music even more valuable. Swati Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Pahi Jaga Janani&#8217; with the niraval at &#8216;Mohana Daragatri Muni Sa Muda Geye&#8217; had  well knit swaras focusing on dhaivatam.  Rahul, another up and coming youngster on the violin followed Sriranjani like a shadow. It is also an art to  match  the style of the main singer and at the same time not lose one&#8217;s  identity and Rahul proved it. His  raga essays and swara exchanges in Dhanyasi, Kanada and Vachaspati showed that he is a mature and dependable supporting artiste.The brigade on the whole was young and vibrant, with Arjun Ganesh on the mridangam and N. Rajaram on the ghatam providing picture-perfect rhythmic inputs.
