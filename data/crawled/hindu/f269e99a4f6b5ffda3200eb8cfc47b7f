VThe Shriram Shankarlal Music Festival kept up  its tradition of incorporating a fine blend of maestros with talented young artistes at the Kamani auditorium this past week. &#8220;The USP of this year&#8217;s festival,&#8221; said the festival director Shobha Deepak Singh, &#8220;is maestros on each day&#8221;.  The festival  opened with a scintillating sitar recital by Ustad Shahid Parvez, besides Pandit Jasraj on the inaugural evening, Pandit Rajan-Sajan Mishra on the second evening and Ustad Rashid Khan on the concluding evening. There was also a morning session of vocal  by Veena Sahasrabuddhe.Veena opened the morning  with raga Shuddha Sarang, and went on to sing a trivat in the same raga after presenting the bada and chhota khayals set to Vilambit Ek tala and Teen tala respectively. The next raga was Hindol with the traditional composition &#8220;Chalat boond pari&#8230;&#8221; in slow Roopak tala, followed by a ragamala (garland of ragas) starting with Hindol itself, which incorporated nearly 18 ragas  including Bhoopali, Chhayanat, Bilawal, Shankara, Desh, Tilak Kamod, etc. It was followed by a Hori in the same raga before she concluded with a couple of nirgun bhajans by Kabirdas. The Shirodkars accompanied her ably on the tabla and harmonium.Rajan-Sajan Mishra opened their vocal recital with raga Jaijaivanti. The tonal variations of their swaras had myriad shades to suit the lyrics of the bara and chhota khayal &#8220;Aiso naval laadali Raadhaa&#8230;&#8221;. Jugalbandi became meaningful when this versatile duo shared their creativity on the same wavelength. Right from the &#8216;sur-dar-sur raga vistaar&#8217; to the torrents of variegated taan patterns, they  complemented each other in a fascinating way. Basant Bahaar was the next raga rendered, before they concluded with a bhajan. Akram Khan took turns of his crisp &#8216;karaamaat&#8217; on the tabla, while Dharmanath showcased his musical imagery on the harmonium. The evening opened with a mesmerising flute recital by Ronu Majumdar accompanied by Ram Kumar Mishra on the tabla.On the concluding day, young Ayaan Ali Khan, the gifted son and disciple of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, opened his sarod recital with raga Jhinjhoti. The slow and systematic unfolding of the raga during the alap vouched for both his taalim and mijaaz. The jod-jhala sequence was accompanied by  pakhawaj played by Fateh Singh Gangani, in the taar-paran style, which is not heard very often these days. The medium tempo composition that followed was set to a challenging rhythmic cycle of nine-and-a-half beats, composed by Ayaan himself. Sandip Das accompanied him on the tabla with exactly the same phrasing of tala as demanded by the composition. Ayaan went on to play a traditional composition in raga Darbari Kanhara which was accompanied by both tabla and pakhawaj, before concluding his recital with a Pahadi dhun.The festival concluded with a breathtaking Sohni tarana by Ustad Rashid Khan, who opened his recital with a reposeful Bageshri bada khayal &#8220;Pyaari piya sang&#8230;&#8221; set to slow Ek tala. Groomed by none other than Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan, Rashid has imbibed the authentic technique and characteristic features of the Rampur Saheswan style. Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan was noted for his taranas and so is Rashid. He also sang raga Kaushik Dhwani and a dadra. Anand Gopal Bandopadhyaya on the tabla, Jayram Poddar on the harmonium and Murad Ali on the sarangi were apt choices for accompaniment, but while the sarangi was too loud, the harmonium was inaudible for quite some time.
