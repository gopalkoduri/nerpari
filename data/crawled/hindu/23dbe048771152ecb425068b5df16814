VSwarasankula Hindustani Sangeetha Sabha, Mysore, celebrated its annual day conducting series of cultural programmes including concerts by Nitin Rajaram Shastri and senior artiste, Shantaram Hegde. The evening session displayed young tabala player Trilochan Kampli's dexterity over his instrument.In his solo rhythm concert, Kampli admirably devoted himself to demonstrate every possible combination and permutation in dovetailing varieties of rhythm patterns set to teentaal, and won the hearts of both the laymen and scholars alike.Reputed singer Shantaram Hegde sang with a virile voice charging the compositions with the required verve. Yet, in the higher octaves, though it could be termed as an example of khula avaaz, the chords tended to be rough. The badhat in all the numbers he selected had method in them, and incorporated the necessary elements of embellishments. An overview still pointed at a predominance of vigorous taans as the main attractive phases in the vistar-s. When such taans in various frequencies and amplitudes were arriving at precise final down beats (sams) of those evolved imaginative and emphatic passages, the feats sent signals of his astounding competence in the art form and remarkable control over the expanding progressions.In spite of these exemplary merits there appeared shortcomings in matters of gentle vocal inflections to convincingly convey the lyrical imports. Observe his first cheez, &#8220;Banara Mora&#8221; in Kalyani. The introductory phases of rag expansion (ochchar and chalan) could have been more lucid and pleasing.With the gradual changes in the tempo, the fervour, different lyrical sections had to convey, started taking different scholarly impacts; bol alaaps, bol taans unfurled incessantly, with sargams attractively interspersed.However, for lack of gentleness and subtleties the text lost its melodic impact and full import. Consider in this context, the lyrics, &#8220;Gaavo Hari Naam Madhura&#8221; and &#8220;Kamala Nayana&#8221;. There were movements aggressive not conducive to convey the expected emotive content impregnated in those lyrics to the full satisfaction: the reason was a dearth of soft accentuations and pleasing vocal modulations.Hegde concluded the above major khyal with the cheez, &#8220;Eri Ali&#8221; followed by a tarana - these areas thoroughly vouching for the artiste's in-depth imagination in framing the musical phrases and astounding mastery in easily evolving the rhythm patterns.&#8220;Kanganva Mora&#8221; (Kedar) thrived on his extempore flowing incessantly in its both sthayi and antara (&#8220;Jo Tum&#8221;) sections. The singer was at his best in the tarana section &#8212; sprightly and masterly. &#8220;Ram Hi Ram Rahe&#8221; of Meera was the concluding number that had finer elements of both Bhakti and music.Shri Ram Bhat (harmonium) and Trilochan Kampli (tabala) meticulously followed the learned singer and complemented him in all his endeavours in presenting before the audience a good concert, whatever may be the passing shortcomings. Nitin Rajaram Shastri lent vocal support.
