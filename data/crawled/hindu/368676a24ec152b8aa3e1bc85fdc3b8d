VWell begun is half-done. M.K. Sankaran Namboothiri commenced his evening concert with Swarna Venkatesa Dikshitar's &#8216;Sivathraya Maha Ganapathim' in Nattai. It has an unusual Pallavi, having all the three kaalaas and eduppu as in Desaadhi. Its chittaiswaram is gracefully symmetrical. Namboothiri added a few apt kalpanaswaras and Mysore V Srikanth on the violin just excelled in this.GNB's &#8216;Nee Paadhame Gathi,' which is the very definition of Nalinakanthi was rendered in all its beauty. &#8216;Sri Parvathi Sankari' provided the suitable place to generate some lilting kalpanaswaras. After a relaxed Arabhi alapana which included a few fast raga sancharas, Namboothiri presented &#8216; Naadhasudhaarasa' of Tyagaraja in Rupakam.Oothukkadu is a vaagyeyakaara from whom you can expect varied kriti formats. His Gati Bheda sequences are as charismatic as they are spontaneous. The Hamir Kalyani piece, &#8216; Naadha Murali Gaanaviloala' is one such. It begins in Thisra nadai and its Chathusra nadai charanam is a creation of melodic beauty. Sankaran Namboothiri brought out its full charm. Dikshitar's &#8216; Sriguruguhathaarayaasumaam' came out in a powerful Suddha Saveri.Showing expertiseNevertheless, his Mohanam alapana overshadowed all earlier efforts. It was a unique interpretation pointing to the artist's expertise. Srikanth's delineation was equally bright and tuneful. &#8216;Maati Maatiki' of Tyagaraja in Misra Chapu was the kriti. The niraval and kalpanaswaras were at &#8216;Mangalakararoopa.' The Thani offered by the veteran Guruvayur Dorai (mridangam) and Pudukkottai Ramachandran (ghatam) was one of the best among those this critic had a chance to listen to this season. Dorai's ultra soft touch and superfast patterns were bewitching.The Vaasanthi Ragam Thanam and Pallavi, &#8216;Velava, Vadivelava, Manavaalava' in Khandajaathi Triputai was outstanding. It had Trikalam, Thisram and Ragamalika Swaras in Revati, Hindolam and Valaji. The rhythm section offered a mini-thani. Gopalakrishna Bharati's Behag piece, &#8216; Irakkam Varaamal' created a different mood. Narayana Thirthar's Tharangam, &#8216;Jaya Jaya Durge' in Durga, Sri Vadi Raja's &#8216; Baaro Murare' in Desh and the Yamuna kalyani javali were well presented.Sankaran Namboothiri concluded his concert with Lalgudi's Pahadi Thillana, Purandara Dasar's &#8216;Nanda Thanaya' in Abheri and a delightfully charming Ayyappan Song in Malayalam &#8211; a listener's request.
