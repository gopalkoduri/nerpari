VSANKAR NIt was a memorable experience for members of `Chitsabha.' Chengelpet Ranganathan treated this group of traditional music lovers to some rare pieces composed by Thyagaraja. The chamber concert at Kottakal began with `Entharo Mahanubhavulu,' the last Pancharatna kriti of Thyagaraja in Shri ragam. It was followed by `Etla Dorakitivo', a chowka kala kriti of Thyagaraja in Vasantha. Analapanaof Kalyanavasantham followed. `Kanulu takani' of Thyagaraja in Rupakam, sung at a slow pace, had an excellent 15-minute neraval at `Manamohanaanda Madachakora Nayana.'Next was a fast rendition of `Bhavaye Parama Gurum' of Sadashiva Brahmendra in Poorvi. `Mari mari ninne' of Thyagaraja in Kambhoji, was the main piece.The thrilling ragam thanam pallavi in raga Sripadam (a janya of Kharaharapriya) was set to Khanda Triputa (six beats offset). Other ragas dealt within the pallavi were Begada, Sahana, and Ranjani. The concert ended with a virutham in Kedaragowla, Atana, Madhyamavathi and Suruti.Unique experienceThe three-hour concert was a unique experience.  The knowledge of the audience in Carnatic music these days are sadly limited. Songs like `Etla Dorakitivo,' `Kanulu takani' and `Mari mari ninne' are rarely heard in contemporary concert platforms. But through the tireless efforts by the likes of Ranganathan, these valuable kritis and their grandeur will not be lost.The slowkalapramanamofalapanaand kriti singing and the elongated gamakams were the characteristic features of his music.Edappali Ajith on the violin and Trivandrum Vaidyanathan on the mridangam provided brilliant accompaniment.Chengelpet Ranganathan had his training under the famous harmonist Alathur Venkateshwara Iyer, who belonged to the Thyagaraja Shishyaparampara. He was later trained by Alathur brothers. He had his arangetram in 1955 and served All India Radio for 20 years.Bottom Template Starts
