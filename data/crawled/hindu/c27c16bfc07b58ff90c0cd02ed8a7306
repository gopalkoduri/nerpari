VO.S. Thiagarajan, known for his technical competence has been groomed by his father in the core of Carnatic Music.Strictly adhering to tradition, his vocal recital at the &#8216;Enlightening Music Utsav&#8217; held under the aegis of Arsha Kalarangam displayed stately virtuosity in all the numbers he handled.Thiagarajan&#8217;s effervescent opening of &#8216;Guruleka&#8217; (Gowrimanohari) with niraval and chittaswarams followed by &#8216;Ramanannubrovara&#8217; set the tone for a lively musical session.&#8216;Nadathanumanisam&#8217; (Chittaranjani) and &#8216;Enraikku Siva Kripai&#8217; (Mukhari) were rendered with aesthetic flourish. His alapana for  Mohanam, the main piece of the recital,  brought out the various shades of the raga  for the kriti, &#8216;Nannupaalimpa.&#8217;&#8216;Vande Matharam&#8217; (Ragamalika) and &#8216;Naanoru Vilayaattu Bommaiya&#8217; (Navarasakannada) were the other items on the agenda.Balasubramaniam&#8217;s (violin) responses in the ragas and swaras were  spontaneous.The laya wing in the hands of Prakash (mridangam) proved its mettle adding pep to the recital.Earlier,  Swami Dayananda Saraswathi honoured senior vidwans such as T.V. Sankaranarayanan, N.Ramani (flute).M.S. Gopalakrishnan (violin), Umayalpuram Sivaraman (mridangam) and A.K.C. Natarajan (clarionet) with  the Arsha Kala Bhushanam awards.Sowmya  displayed her exquisite manodharma to taper the raga phrases with gana-naya through the entire session. Her insouciant opening varnam in Naatakurinji and &#8216;Ekambaresa Naayike&#8217; were sung with effortless  ease. There was an aromatic tenderness in her mapping the contours of Shanmukhapriya for the kriti, &#8216;Parvathi Nayakane.&#8217; The felicity of the sancharas in her exposition of Ritigowlai for &#8216;Nannuvidachi&#8217; revealed the lilting grace of the raga. The Thodi raga vinyasam built with madhyakaala passages with akara as the predominant form of expression was song soporific to the listeners. The song &#8216;Kartikeya Gaangeya&#8217; rendered with a pleasing niraval and swaras was followed by &#8216;Sree Sankara Guruvaram&#8217; (Nagaswarali). Embar Kannan followed the vocalist with perfect comprehension giving impressive replies in the raga exposition and swaras. Narayanan&#8217;s (mridangam) rhythmic support enhanced the kutcheri&#8217;s value.In his vocal concert on the concluding day of the fest  one could see T.M. Krishna&#8217;s  heightened ability to harness his obedient voice exploring new vistas of creativity.  His niraval and cascade of swaras for the opening &#8216;Seethapathi Naamanasuna&#8217; (Khamas)  was a tasteful interpretation of the sahitya.After an exuberant rendition of Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Sree Varalakshmi Namasthubhyam,&#8217; his alapana of Mohanam was built  with perceptive vigour for the kriti, &#8216;Bhavanutha.&#8217; His sangatis,  while delving deep to explore the nuggets of Khambodi, were scholarly in exposition and weighty in manodharma.The kriti &#8216;Sree Sunrahmanyaya Namasthe&#8217; was  a blissful presentation. Chandramouli (violin) revealed his class in the richness of sancharas in ragas and swara sallies. Balaji (mridangam) and Anirudh Athreya (ganjira) accompanied the recital with deft fingers in their laya exercise.
