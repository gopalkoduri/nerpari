VAs the curtains went up for the concert, K.P. Nandini greeted with the traditional Namaste.Undeterred by the near empty hall Nandini commenced her concert with the beautiful Charukesi varnam of Lalgudi.Nandini, who is also a well known violinist, has a unique timbre, despite her pitch at four and a half.The cadence with which she executed Mee Su Krishnan's &#8216;Dayapayonidhe' (Jaganmohini-Adi) inspired her into short kalpanaswaras.Bharadwaj (mridangam) played in this phase with the maturity of a veteran.Raga Saramathi was the sub-main that found Nandini essaying a well structured raga alapana. Passionate phrases interspersed with brigas in a limited fashion were proof enough of the grooming by her mother, Uma, of the famed Mayavaram sisters duo.Her brother K.P. Haricharan (violin), in a more relaxed manner gave a fitting reply.Contrasting speedA slow paced rendition of Tyagaraja's &#8216;Mokshamu' was appealing. &#8216;Seethamma Mayamma' (Vasantha - Rupakam-Tyagaraja) at a contrasting speed paved way for the afternoon's main ragam. In Kalyani, Nandini sketched a picture of flowers, all richly coloured. Haricharan's counter was a vintage treat. Niraval and swaras for &#8216;Pankajalochana' (Swati Tirunal) were completed with ease while Bharadwaj played an exceptionally well conceived thani.
