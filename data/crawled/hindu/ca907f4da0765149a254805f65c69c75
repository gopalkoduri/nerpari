VFull fledged rehearsals were not MLV&#8217;s cup of tea. She believed in manodharma.The   Asura Sadhakam that she did in  her earlier years stood MLV in good stead making her concerts charming.Full fledged rehearsals were not MLV&#8217;s cup of tea. She believed in manodharma.  New additions &#8212; regular in her concerts &#8212; to her repertoire were, however,  polished to a certain degree before presenting them to the audiences. The already polished songs, &#8216;Unnaiandri&#8217; in Bhavani for instance, gained sheen with new hues every time MLV presented them.  There was  a new flourish or a raga embellishment between sangatis heard for the first time.  So fertile was her  imagination.MLV&#8217;s kalpanaswara rendering was something phenomenal.  She blended  her kizhkala swara singing technique with the bhava rich style of Semmangudi. In fact, her  appreciation of Semmangudi&#8217;s music was evident from her swaras in  Sankarabharanam, Nattakurinji, etc in the slow tempo.The bhakti aspect  came to the forefront in MLV&#8217;s ragamalika virutham renderings of Kandar Anuboodhi, Krishna Karnamritham, Abirami Andadi and so on. Of course her soulful versions of the Dasakuta Ugabhogas are unforgettable.One instance of her confidence in her musical capabilities was at one of her concerts in the U.S. in the Eighties. As is the custom abroad where musicians announce details of the song they are going to sing,  MLV, before embarking on an Abhogi alapana informed the audience that a composition of Gopalakrishna Bharati would follow the raga essay. The audience naturally expected &#8216;Sabapathikku&#8217; to follow.MLV&#8217;s manodharma reached dizzy heights on that day, her Abogi vinyasa spanning nearly half-an-hour.  Realising that a small composition like &#8216;Sabapathiku&#8217; would not do justice to  her alapana, MLV launched into a brilliant tanam exposition and made it known to the gathering that she would render a Pallavi instead. It is needless to say that the pallavi and her ragamalika swara outpourings on that occasion were an aural feast!
