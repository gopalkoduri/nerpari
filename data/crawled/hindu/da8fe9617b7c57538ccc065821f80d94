VMozart meets IndiaSa re ga ma - FusionVarious artistes (Rs.199)\u000aSa re ga ma has released a CD album based on Indian ragas that blends with harmony to accompaniment of Western instruments. The first number, `Adieu autumn' in Sindhubhairavi, sung in a clear, ringing tone by the dulcet-voiced Bombay Jayashri Ramnath is swara and jati based.The Sankarabharanam varnam with instrumental innovations is an interesting exercise by Embar Kannan on the violin.Brief excursion into tanam`Mystic meanderings' sung in Pantuvarali by O.S.Arun with a pleasant orchestral backdrop is also more swara and raga oriented, with a brief excursion into Tanam by female singers. The raga spelling would be more correct if spelt Pantuvarali, instead of Banduvarali.Punya Srinivas is a very accomplished veena artiste whose playing is marked by pleasing nada and laya control. Her `Smile of the lotus' in raga Kapi is as refreshing as a sunflower blooming to the rays of the Sun. `The hymn of silence' is a melodic piece in Hamsanandi on the sitar by Kishore Kumar with the `Noopur' and tabla included in the orchestra.`Yaadhum Oore Yaavarum Kelir' is a line in the song of Kanian Poonkunranar and this concept has been elaborated with zest by Kadri Gopalnath in Bilahari on the saxophone. The album is named appropriately "Mozart meets India."S.P.Bottom Template Starts
