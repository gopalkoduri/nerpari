VVedavyasa Vignana Varadhi, a non-governmental organisation, organised the concert of renowned duo, Kumaresh and Ganesh at Ravindra Bharati recently as part of its objective of giving financial aid particularly to the student community.On this occasion ten students &#8212; nine girls and one boy &#8212; from various institutions were given scholarships to pursue education. Brothers Kumaresh and Ganesh began their concert with Mohana varnam, Ninnu Kori in two speeds and followed it with a Thyagaraja kriti Nadopasanache in Begada. Entha Vedukondu O Raghava in Saraswathi Manohari was also presented as a concert piece, sharing some creative nuances.Later they descended on Dharmavati for their presentation of raga and swaras as a flow, sans any sahitya. This was in Khandachapu t alam. The beauty of sound was more important for the artistes. The violinists moving from anumandra to tarasthayi in a whiff creating wave like images was amazing. Later they took up another raga Janaranjani and executed it in the same mode.They presented some traditional compositions in the concert style. Okaparikokapari Vayyarame, a composition of Annamacharya in Kharaharapriya and then Shankarabharanam as their main concert piece. The raga was evolved choosing beautiful structures, followed by swaraprasthara, where they came out with impressive spells. Another significant feature of the concert was the role played by percussionists Parupalli S. Phalgun on mridangam and B.S. Arunkumar on morsing and electronic rhythm pads as well, alternating between them in amazing exercises.We never heard such a brilliant play on morsing that even dominated the main percussion mridangam at one stage. In their Tani avartanam, the three instruments came to the fore and it was an enthralling show that tied the audience to their seats, applauding each of the brilliant spell.They followed each of the violin wizards in the kirtana part, like we watch in a jugalbandi. At the end Kumaresh rendered a Ramadasu kirtana O Rama Nee Namamentho Ruchira in Nadanamakriya with perfect expression.
