VThe highlight of the birth centenary of Dwaram Narasingarao Naidu lay in the recital by the vocal wizard Padma Vibhushan Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna last week at the Port Kalavani Auditorium.Presenting an effulgent picture of an empathetic embodiment of sublime Naada and an epitome of an erudite musicianship from the word go starting withPanchamaatangamukha Ganapathiof Dixitar (Malhari) preluded with a brief but beautiful aalapana, literally he kept all in the auditorium (more than 2000 capacity) and almost an equal number in the lawns around it entranced for two hours till he concluded his concert with his own thillana in Brindavani.He exquisitely sang theSriraga Pancharatnakriti of Thyagaraja &#8212;Endaro Mahanubhavulu&#8212; again adorned with a similar aalapana,Dandamupettarugaof the same Vaggeyakara (Balahamsa),Akhilandeswariof Syamasastri (Karnataka Kapi) andDevaadi Devaof Mysore Vasudevachar (Sunadavinodini) prefixed with absorbing aalapana elaborately and concluded with enticing swaram.He then chose the rarely heard compositions of ThyagarajaSree Ramya Chittalankaara Chitta(Jayamanohari), composition of Annamayya (Sanskrit) in Hindolam with aalapana, his ownAnnee neevein Mohana with an eruditely expounded aalapana, Sitaramaswamy andPaluke Bangarumayaraof Ramdas in Naadanaamakriya and Anandabhairavi also adorned with aalapana andNaarayanathe Namonamo(Behag) in between. Thus, he made it a delightful treat of haunting melody, but not without a little disappointment in sincere connoisseurs of Carnatic music because of the conspicuous absence of any expansive expatiation of any major composition in any major raga.Warmly enthused by him from time to time, the young accompanists, Dwaram Satyanarayanarao on violin, D.S.R. Murty on mridangam, K. Shyamkumar on kanjeera, morsing by Ghantasala S. Sai and the whistle wizard Siva Prasad occasionally lent commensurably good support. His disciple Saraswathi (noted danseuse) gave bits of information about her guru&#8217;s achievements from his childhood days.
