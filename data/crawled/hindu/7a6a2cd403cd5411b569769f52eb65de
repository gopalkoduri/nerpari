VA pleasing tone marked all the evening when young flautist L.V. Mukund presented a lively flute recital at Sri Shankara Math, Shankarapuram. He was performing in a series of music programmes held at the Math in connection with its centenary celebrations.  It is noteworthy that a software engineer Mukund had left his lucrative job to dedicate himself fully to music. He performed with conviction. Strong sense of laya contributed to the tautness of his interpretations. His &#\u000a8220;Vatapi Ganapathim bhaje&#8221;, &#8220;Endaro Mahanubhavulu&#8221; (Sri) was interesting.  The pleasing performance was enriched by the virtuoso support of Natajaramurthy (violin) and V.S. Rajagopal (mridanga). The swara-sahitya-shuddhi was something remarkable.There was total involvement of the instrumentalist. The audience instantly warmed up to the impact of Mukund&#8217;s rendition of Simhendramadhyama (&#8220;Kamakshi&#8221;), Mohana (&#8220;Kadambari priyayai&#8221;) and Shubhapantuvarali and the general air of being tuned to concert pitch. &#8220;Himadrisute paahi mam&#8221; was presented with well balanced parts, the alapana and kalpanaswaras were well executed, the trills precise, the tone clear and pleasing. It was an aptly chosen composition for delineation.  He holds much promise.M. SURYA PRASADBottom Template Starts
