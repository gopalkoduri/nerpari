VJAYARAMAN VThe Poornathrayeesa Sangeethotsavam  at Sree Poornathrayeesa Temple, Thripunithura, went on from morning till late into the night. Many maestros and up-and-coming  vocalists and instrumentalists participated. Pancharathnam,  (featuring mostly the lyrics penned by Tripunithura Jayaprakash), held at the `Aanappanthal,' was a pulsating event in which many stalwarts in Kerala participated.Pancharathnam had Seethalakshmi in the lead and after `Sree Ganapthinee' (Saurashtram) from `Prahlathabhakthivijayam,' she went on to `Guruleka' (jhampa) in Gowrimanohari.Quiet startSree Poornathrayeesa Sangeethotsavam, which started on March 5, 1988, with a single concert by Perumbavur G. Ravindranath,  has, over the years, become a leading music festival in  Thripunithura.  Many prominent musicians including T.S. Radhakrishnaji have been honoured with the title of `Sangeetha Poornasree' and this year it went to Madras G.N. Deshikan.It was P. Unnikrishnan who flagged off the major section of the concerts in his customary fluent style with a varnam (`Saami Ninne' by Shatkaala Narasayya) in Panthuvarali. His endeavour to bring forth the `rakthi' factor in Sarasangi bore fruit through Swati Tirunal's `Jaya jaya Padmanabha.'  Hamsanaadam was captivating with `Bandurithi'. Ashtapadi in Madhuvanthi and `Paarilenkum' in Sindhubhairavi  were rendered sensitively  by his disciple.T.V Ramanujacharyalu (violin), B. Harikuamar (mridangam) and Kovai Suresh (ghatom) proved to be an excellent combination.G.N. Deshikan, who sings with vivid flashes of Madurai Mani Iyer, is a  favourite with young music lovers who have not had an opportunity  to listen to Mani Iyer's concerts.After `Bhrovabharama,' Deshikan chose to sing `Bhavanutha' (Mohanam). `Abhivaadayasree'  in Vaachaspathi was the pick of the concert. Chembai Rajendran (violin), A.S. Subbaraman (mridangam) and Tripunithura Kannan (ghatom) did their job well.Whenever Sankaran Nambuthiri is on the stage, music lovers are transported to the mystical realms of Carnatic music.  In keeping with the spirit of the festival, he confined himself to  kritis by Jayaprakash.  Nedumangadu Sivanandan was on the violin and Palakkad Jayakrishnan was on the mridangam.Wide knowledgeN.P. Ramaswamy with his wide knowledge and experience gave a comprehensive description of Thodi, along with `Avathumaam' by Jayaprakash.He was accompanied by Nellai Viswanathan on the violin and Kangazha Vasudevan Nambuthiri on the  mridangam.T.N. Krishnan and  his daughter Viji Krishnan played `Gajjaananayutham' (Chakravaakam), `Saarasaaksha' (Panthuvarali), `Krishnaa ni begane' (Yaman kalyan) and `Saapashia' (Jonpuri) in that typical alluring TNK bani. T.R. Rajamani was on the  mridangam  and Thripunithura Radhakrishnan accompanied on the  ghatom.Downpour of melodyWhen Trichy Ganeshan sings,  there is a downpour of melody. The first part of his concert was dedicated  to Jayaprakash's compositions in Sanskrit and Tamil. `Kalitha Kuvalaya' (Lalith) had a skilfully woven tapestry of Pallavi. `Aadi Bhagavanin' (Khamas) was in Tamil.He concluded the Sangeethotsavam with `Vaancha Thonu' in Karnaranjini by Muthayya Bhagavathar.The accompanists were T.H. Subrahmaniam on the violin, Palladam Ravi on the mridangam and Radhakrishnan on the ghatom. The music festival was organised by Jayaprakasha Sangeetha Parishath and Kshethrakshema Samithy.Bottom Template Starts
