VPure music combined with a balanced approach towards kalpitha (rendering compositions as learnt) and manodharma (improvisation techniques like raga alapana, niraval and swaraprastara) aspects  gets translated into great concert outcomes. This is what  happened the other day in the concert of Sreeram Prasad and Ravikumar, popularly called the Malladi Brothers. Their concert was held on the opening day of the four-day Tyagaraja Music Festival, 2008, organised by Sree Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha in the Capital recently.The duo began impressively with &#8220;Ninne bhajana&#8221;, a composition of Tyagaraja in raga Nattai. The presentation of this composition  and the subsequent lively swaraprastaras  provided an indication of their musical talents at the very beginning. Yet another of Tyagaraja&#8217;s compositions, &#8220;Endundi vedalitivo&#8221; in raga Darbar including the swarasprastaras towards the end underwent fine treatment.The  brothers&#8217; recital was dominated  by Tyagaraja&#8217;s compositions. Hailing from Andhra Pradesh  and being of Telugu mother tongue, the duo had a natural edge in bringing out the sahitya bhava of these compositions.The hallmarks of &#8220;Nammi vachchina&#8221;, yet another composition of Tyagaraja, in raga Kalyani, were a fine alap  by the younger sibling Ravikumar, niraval of the phrase &#8220;Nada Rupa Sri Soundarya Nayakipate&#8221; and swaraprastaras flowing with rich creativity. Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Maanasa Guruguha&#8221; in raga Ananda Bhairavi and Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Padavi ni&#8221; in raga Salaga Bhairavi were emotive. As the main item, the duo took up Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Sri Raghuvara premeya&#8221; in raga Kamboji. Earlier, the duo, in turns, presented a fine sketch of this raga. The swaraprastaras including the korvai finish towards the end were full of creative formats. However, they need to tone down their aggressiveness.After the taniavartanam session, the duo took care to include a variety of emotive compositions including those of Bhadrachala Ramadasa, Purandaradasa and Annamacharya which had a telling effect in the auditorium of Andhra Pradesh Bhavan.M.S.N. Murthy on the violin, Poongulam Subramaniam on the mridangam and H. Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam ably assisted the Malladi Brothers and contributed significantly. In sum, this concert will linger long in the memories of Delhi rasikas.Elsewhere, at the Festival of Bhakti Songs organised by the Vadakku Vaasal Trust, the performance of Pithukuli Murugadas  and group enlivened the hearts of listeners. Despite his  85-plus years, Murugadas presented a mesmerising performance for more than two hours on the last day of this festival.The other two &#8216;big ticket&#8217; artistes, Nithyashree Mahadevan and Sudha Raghunathan, sadly, did not create a lasting impression. Improvisation techniques in the form of raga alapana and swaraprastaras were  conspicuous by their absence. Plausibly, the Trust thought that the essence of bhakti would be lost if these techniques were used. But then, it was akin to a situation of serving sugarless coffee even to those who were not diabetics. The saving grace was that these two artistes tactfully preceded some of their songs with slokas and verses in the form of viruttams, in which a brief sketch of some of the ragas could be brought to the fore. Ultimately, rasikas had to settle with half-a-spoon of sugar.
