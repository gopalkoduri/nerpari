VVisakhapatnam witnessed a series of  Annamayya Jayanti celebrations last week. The most prominent among them was the marathon session of recital of thesankeertanas of the 15th century Telugu Pada Kavitha Pithamaha. It was fervently organised with Suhasini Anand in the lead in VUDA Children Theatre under the aegis of Silicon Andhra and Department of Culture.The prelude -nagarasankeertana -constituted a wide range of artistes in different age groups.The recitals were of 10, 15, 20 and 30 minute durations and went on through the day.Vocal recitals were rendered by the music students and staff of the A.U. Department of Music and its members.Veterans like S. Vasundhara Devi,  Anuradha,  Dwaram Thyagaraju and others interspersed with veena, violin and even dance recitals by up and coming and well accomplished artistes individually and in groups provided an absorbing mood.The entire show was  compered by Pemmaraju Purnachandra Rao of Hyderabad.A similar commemoration that was held under the auspices of Nada Sudha Tarangini Trust of Sangeetha Kalaanidhi Nedunuri Krishna Murty and Sri Shirdi Sai Baba Spiritual Centre on the same day, though only in the evening in the premises of the centre in Seethammadhara, left almost a similar impact.Recitals of Annamayya&#8217;s compositions by Chaitanya Brothers (Varanasi Venkateswara Sarma and Bukkapatnam Krishnamachari) followed by a discursive talk on Annamayya&#8217;s poesy by  Garikipati Narasimha Rao marked the evening.A.R.SBottom Template Starts
