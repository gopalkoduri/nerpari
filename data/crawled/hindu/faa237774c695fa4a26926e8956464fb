VA series of Carnatic concerts of varying calibre had music buffs at their discerning best as stalwart T.V. Sankaranarayanan and up-and-coming singers took to the stage at the annual music fete of the Edapally Sangeeta Sadas.Gayathri Venkataraghavan's voice appeared to have the verve and weightiness that is particular to male singers; perhaps owing to her training under veteran Carnatic musicians A. Sundaresan and V. Subramaniam.Her concert, which started with the varnam &#8216;Karunimpa' in Sahana raga, proceeded to a sloka rendition in Todi followed by &#8216;Pankajakshanam Ramesan,' a Malayalam kriti of Swati Tirunal. She took up a stirring niraval in &#8216;Padmanabha pahi pahi ennu loka sanchayam'; lines which carry deep spiritual import.Detailed sketch of VasanthaThe vocalist gave a comprehensive sketch of Vasantha raga followed by &#8216;Hariharaputhram Sastaram.' This was ably supported by Nanjil Arul on the mridangam.A dynamic raga alaapana of Kamboji and a sloka rendition unfurled the nuances of the raga. She went for the popular kriti &#8216;O Rangasayee.' The highpoint was the niraval on &#8216;Bhooloka vaikuntam,' especially in the second speed, which was marked by interesting variations. The vocalist was at her expressive best in her niraval expositions. However she tripped in her rendition of the Mukthaippu. Adding to her woes Manjil Unnikrishnan failed to get the beat at many points, even in the taniavartanam.The vocalist put up a decent ragam tanam pallavi in Ananda Bhairavi. Avaneeswaram Vinu supported well on the violin. The tanam exposition, sung along with the mridangam, an exercise rarely done these days, was amusing. Eleven-year-old flautist B.S. Hariprasad performed on the second day.T.V. Sankaranarayanan (TVS) did not fail to leave his mark with his delectable sloka renditions and distinctive style of swara singing. The elaboration of Vasanta brimmed with raga bhava, and the swara passages for &#8216;Paramapurusha jagadeeswara' had korvai phrases sung with spontaneous verve and effortless ease.Well-timed phrasesWhen the concert started to sound routine and bland, TVS came up with uniquely packed, well-timed phrases to close each swara essay. Long sustained notes and endings made the alaapana of Shanmukhapriya quite delightful. TVS sang Muthaiah Bhagavathar's &#8216;Vallinayakane.' He presented a detailed niraval and swaras for the rarely-heard raga Kapinarayani for the song &#8216;Sarasasamadana.' A rather majestic elaboration of Sankarabharanam was followed by &#8216;Sarojadalanetri,' a Syama Sastri composition. He was supported well by Edapally Ajith on the violin.&#8216;Amba Neelayathakshi,' sung in Vilamba kala (slow pace) in Neelambari, stood out in T.N.S. Krishna's concert on the final day. His kalpanaswaras for &#8216;Samajavaragamana' in Hindolam displayed the working of a quick, creative mind. However, his Saveri alaapana failed to impress. Lack of melody and feel prevailed throughout the concert.Ragam tanam pallavi performed in more than one raga has become almost a regular feature in Krishna's concerts. Such an exercise was admirably executed in Shanmukhapriya and Abhogi. The tanam was well expressed. Intermixing of ragas in quick , short phrases was cleverly done, considering the difficulty involved. Dr. Babu on the mridangam and Trivandrum Sampath on the violin performed with finesse.
