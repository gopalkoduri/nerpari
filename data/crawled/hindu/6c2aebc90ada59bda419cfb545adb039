VPure music reigned when veteran flautist K.S. Gopalakrishnan performed to a packed hall in Kochi in connection with a concert series by Rasikapriya to mark its 34th anniversary. The hallmark of his recital was the purity of his bani and aesthetic improvisations that never strayed from Carnatic music. His brief alapana of Nattakurinji was followed by the varnam &#8216;Chalamela.'As Rasikapriya is is also celebrating GNB's centenary year, Gopalakrishnan performed a rare composition of the late maestro in Natta. T.H. Subramaniam unfurled the beauty of the raga on his violin. This was followed by &#8216;Karimukha varada maam paalaya.'Emotive fervourThe kuraippu swaras in the swara phase were exciting. Surprisingly, the composition &#8216;Theliyaleru rama' was played at a slow pace. The flautist brought out the emotive fervour of Ranjani in a progressive alapana.&#8216;Durmargachara dhamulanu' in Roopaka tala was the chosen Tyagaraja composition. The korvai swaras ended in a coordinated mukhthaippu that was dainty and crisp. This was ably supported by Nanjil Arul on the mridangam. Perukavu Sudheer too showed commendable mastery on the ghatam. &#8216;Enthamuddo entha sogaso' in Bindumalini was followed by a detailed elaboration of Kharaharapriya.The alapana progressed through systematic stages and it attained its admirable form in the middle register. The majestic kriti &#8216;Chakkani raja' was sung with due reverence to the numerous sangatis in the composition. The taniavarthanam by Arul and Sudheer was comprehensive and explorative.After a brisk rendition of &#8216;Bhogeendrashaayinam' in Kuntalavarali, Gopalakrishnan presented &#8216;Narayana the namo,' a composition of Purandara Dasa in Behag. He wound up the concert with &#8216;Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma' in Madhyamavati.
