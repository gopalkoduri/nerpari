VHe had already tried his expertise in Tyagaraja Ramayanam (where he was very much at ease) and Kamba Ramayanam (where he proved that he was more comfortable with Tyagaraja) and this time round he chose Valmiki proving in the bargain that  that Kambar is closer to him  and that Tyagaraja is his best companion.On his opening day elucidation at Hamsadhwani,  one had to  wait for 45 long minutes for the first reference to Valmiki. Till then he was entertaining the bemused audience with a heavy dose of &#8216;Rama Nama&#8217; tuned to various ragas and songs followed by an explanation on the significance of Rama&#8217;s birth. Slokas did not fall behind. Seshagopalan&#8217;s robust voice was in full force and therefore, Kalyani, Shanmukhapriya, Bhairavi, Madhuvanti, Atana and Ritigowla were flowing like refreshing streams making the listeners almost forget that they were sitting to hear Valmiki&#8217;s verses.Seshagopalan&#8217;s strength and weakness are one and the same. He can wax eloquent on any subject  with digression aplenty, information abundant slipping from one to another through a feeble link of a small word.Understandably, a task to compress and give the essence of 24,000 verses of Valmiki in just five days is no easy job.But TNS is a multifaceted person who accepts challenges. The problem is he touches the main point after a lot of  meandering.For instance,  in Seetha Swaymvaram, Seshagopalan lost himself in the commendable qualities of Rama, as described by Kamban,  Azhwar and his favourite Tyagaraja,  almost relegating to the background the   principal elements of the series &#8212; Valmiki and his poetry. He delved  deep into the single phrase, &#8216;Vatsa Rama Dhanuh Pashya&#8217; of Valmiki,  where Viswamithra tells Rama just to have a look at the Shiva Dhanush in Janaka&#8217;s palace; he came up with  innumerable interpretations finally landing on Tyagaraja with &#8216;Alaga Lalla Lada&#8217; in Madhyamavati only  to quickly  jump for the Thiru-arutpa stanza, &#8216;Petra Thai Thanai.&#8217;True, this reveals amazing memory and the capacity to recall but it also leads to wandering that is not quite relevant.  Are so many references and off-tangent analogies necessary?If the audience  had come to hear Seshagopalan&#8217;s delicious explanations and cross-references highlighting the beauty of  Valmiki&#8217;s poetry that was not what it got.Even early on the fourth day, Ayodhya Kandam had not been crossed. Seshagopalan was still admiring Valmiki&#8217;s description of Rama&#8217;s conversational and interpersonal skills through &#8216;Buddhimaan Madhuraabhaashhii Purvabhaashhii Priyamvadah&#8217; and immediately resorting to &#8216;Emani Matladivo&#8217; of Tyagaraja.If  Bala and Ayodhya Kandas could not be traversed in three days how would he cover  the remaining four &#8212; Aaranya, Kishkinda, Sundara and Yuddha &#8212; comprising 341 chapters in the  next two days?TNS is a skilful raconteur, well-read and a genius in music but conspicuous by absence was  time management, so vital for a discourse of this nature.And it reiterated the fact that  Seshagopalan&#8217;s forte is  music and  Harikatha just provides the platform  for him to demonstrate that talent.
