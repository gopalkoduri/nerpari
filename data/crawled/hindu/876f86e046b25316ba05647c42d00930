VOrganised in the traditional &#8216;Baithak&#8217; format, two artistes &#8211; Sandipan Samajpati and Shruti Sadolikar &#8211; both with unique and intense styles regaled the audience. The programme was sponsored by Indovax of Keggfarms Group, and noted connoisseur of music from Delhi, Vinod S. Kapur played a key role in organising the baithak.In front of a full house, Sandipan cast a spell of magic on the audience with his classical vocal recital. The young vocalist from Kolkata has won several laurels, including the prestigious Aditya Vikram Birla Kalakiran Award in 2005. Although not too well known in Delhi circles he is bound to go back with a fairly large number of fans after his virtuoso performance which gave a glimpse of his repertoire (he is trained in the Kirana Gharana tradition).This was followed by the recital of Shruti Sadolikar, who represents the orthodox Jaipur Atrauli Gharana, having trained under her guru and father Wamanrao Sadolikar and Gullu Jasdanwala. Braving the chilly winds that lashed the Capital on the Lohri day, the audience, including a fair sprinkling of foreigners, sat in rapt attention enjoying Shruti&#8217;s thumris and dadras.
