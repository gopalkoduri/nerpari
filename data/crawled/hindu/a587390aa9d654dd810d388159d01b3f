VSivaprasad made a serious attempt to present the concert in the traditional way and saw to it that he could scale through at least a couple of octaves. He had a company of talented musicians &#8211; Dinkar on the violin, D.S.R. Murthy (mridangam), P.V.Ramanamurthy (ghatam) and Shyamkumar (kanjira). Siva Prasad has already given a number of programs in India and outside entertaining the listeners with this curious &#8216;lip music&#8217;. He was able to reproduce what Hindustani musicians like Shahanai maestro late Bismillah and others did.  This time his repertoire was purely a carnatic fare opening with a traditional natakuranji raga varnam and then followed by invocationVatapi..in Hamsadhwani. He did swarakalpana carefully and effectively too, with good gamakas. Then there was another composition of Dikshitar&#8217;sSarasijanabha Sodariin Nagagandhaari. He then whistled outSarasamukhiin raga Malhar and also another rare pieceVaralandukoniin Ghurjari. Ranjani was his main melody of the evening and spread over a couple of octaves neatly.
