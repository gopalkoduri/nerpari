VSubrata De, a sitar exponent and the man behind the concert,  came up with a performance of his own that lit up the proceedings. De&#8217;s music reflected spontaneous expression of powerful emotions and his mastery with the sitar.A number of aspiring artistes took the stage. The young star of the evening was 17-year-old Ankita Dash. Her solo  presentation of Sufiana Kalam, &#8220;Damadum Mast Kalandar&#8221;,  came in for lavish praise from the audience.Ankita, trained by Thumri exponent Vidya Rao, the well-known Khayal singer Subhadra Desai and Anshu Thapliyal, a noted classical singer,  captivated the packed hall with her melodious voice.  A part of the music choir of her school, Ankita has received a number of scholarships in music. She has also performed at the Prime Minister&#8217;s Residence, the Human Rights Commission and  Gandhi Smriti.Ankita  was spotted by  De in a school qawwali competition.The concert also presented Odissi vocal, Odissi chhanda, Odissi champu and Saraswati vandana by disciples of Guru Saroj Kumar Mohanty, an eminent composer and expert in Odissi and Hindustani classical music. His disciples, mostly non-Oriyas, managed the nuances of the songs as well as the correct pronunciation.Mohanty said fondly, &#8220;My students sing these Odissi songs with greater ease than even Kavita Krishnamurthy or Udit Narayan.&#8221;Mohanty has done some popular albums in Oriya with these noted playback singers.The concert also showcased a young tabla player, Shubham Sarkar, who impressed the audience with his skilful solo performance.
