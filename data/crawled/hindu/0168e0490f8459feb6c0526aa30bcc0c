VBellari M. Raghavendra\u000aand Shripada Heggade\u000apresented a jugalbandi\u000aunder the auspices of\u000aNadabrahma Sangeetha\u000aSabha. H.M. Smitha (violin),\u000aB. Ravishankar (mridanga),\u000aRavindra Kakoti (harmonium)\u000aand Udayaraj Karpur\u000a(tabla) accompanied the accomplished\u000asingers who\u000arepresented Carnatic and\u000aHindustani styles.This inspiring and invigorating\u000aconcert, creaming\u000aoff all the salient features,\u000adistantly upheld the forms\u000aof both the schools. For this\u000apurpose Rag Puryadhanashri\u000a(equivalent to Panthuvarali)\u000aprovided an excellent\u000afoundation on which the\u000arest of the artistry and extempore\u000aflourished.Observe the alapana section\u000afor example. Unhurried\u000abeginning passed through\u000athe various phases of badhath\u000afinely meshed through\u000amelodic patterns. In every\u000astep, they ideally selected\u000ashort phrases for extensive\u000ainterpretations and worked\u000amethodically to place before\u000athe audience every intricacy\u000athat could possibly be imagined;\u000athe vistar assumed\u000agreater dimensions proportionate\u000awith the extent of\u000afurther progressions.It was only after thoroughly\u000atreating the lower\u000aoctaves the expressions rose\u000ato higher ones. Whereas\u000agandhara, panchama and\u000anishadha acted as pivotal areas\u000afacilitating the developments\u000ain the madhya sthayi,\u000athe delineations freely unfurled\u000aeven to surpass pancham\u000ain the taara sapthak.In the above feats, Raghavendra's\u000arobust vocal chords\u000amajestically reverberated\u000aand Heggade's resilient\u000avoice softly resonated. Nevertheless,\u000athere were instances\u000awhere the tonal\u000aqualities tended to be stentorian,\u000amay be, influenced\u000aby the unbounded climactic\u000afervours.Another special feature\u000awas - "Payaliya Jhankar", a\u000apopular cheez that Raghavendra\u000atranslated into Kannada\u000aadapting it for\u000arendering in the Carnatic\u000astyle.\u000aThough this proved to be\u000aa novel idea, the style he followed\u000abore more resemblances\u000ato that of his\u000acounterpart's Hindustani\u000ashades: appearing more like\u000aan extension of Heggade's\u000aideas and approach.On the other hand, in the\u000aswaraprastara section, he\u000aexceptionally framed the\u000apassages very typical of the\u000aart form he represented,\u000adrawing wide appreciation\u000aand applauses.A thani avartana\u000athat followed exhibited\u000aboth the percussionists'\u000amastery over various pattern-\u000aconfigurations and\u000atheir on-the-stage spontaneity.The last two presentations\u000aMahipathi Dasa's\u000a"Shri Ranganatha" and Basavanna's\u000a"Chakorange\u000aChandramana" (Sindhubhairavi),\u000aelicited a mixed response.\u000aThough there was perfect\u000asynchronisation and understanding\u000abetween the singers,\u000aone wished for a\u000asmoother climax for both\u000athese compositions.Was it an accidental slip\u000aor an intended effort, it was\u000ahard to decipher. When Rag\u000aThodi (similar to Shubhapanthuvarali)\u000aunexpectedly\u000aentered into the picture as\u000aHeggade rendered an emotive\u000aBasavanna's vachana. It\u000acould not be passed of as\u000ashruthibheda , as the\u000aswitchover to Thodi was not\u000asmooth; it suffered from an\u000auneasy momentary confusion.
