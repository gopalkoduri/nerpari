VShrishti&#8217;s Carnatica P LtdV. SanjeevCarnatic Instrumental-ViolinCD &#8211; Price - Rs. 125There has been a steady increase in the number of talented violinists over the past decade, in the Carnatic music arena. Many established violin exponents have successfully groomed their wards, who have by their hard work and innate gnana made their presence felt in the kutcheri circuit and have become sought after accompanists.V. Sanjeev, one amongst A.Kanyakumari&#8217;s numerous disciples, is a talented player whose tonal quality and bowing technique are very similar to that of his mentor. Sanjeev has also had the benefit of tutelage under Tanjore S. Kalyanaraman and his mother V. Brinda. The audio compact disc under review has a good selection of songs which are mostly popular ones.Sanjeev&#8217;s opening phrases of all the ragas played establishes their identity giving no room for ambiguity. The commencement of this recording is with Patnam Subramania Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;Ninnujoochi&#8217; in Sourashtram. This kriti is played in the right tempo and makes for a good and vibrant beginning.A brief vinyasa of Saramathi follows which leads on to Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Mokshamugaladha.&#8217;The raga and kriti bhava are amply reflected in the artist&#8217;s playing. The solfa passages in two kalams are played to perfection for the opening line of the song without the slightest deviation from the raga structure.The alapana of Arabhi is exuberant. It could have had more of lingering karvais (pauses) for better effect. &#8216;Nadasudarasam&#8217; of Tyagaraja in rupaka tala with kalpanaswaras played at the charanam offers music of a professional quality.Amruthabehag is a captivating and tricky raga which was conceived by the legendary G.N.Balasubramaniam. The arohanam reads as &#8216;SMGPNDS&#8217;, while &#8216;SNDMGS&#8217; forms the avarohanam. This raga can be technically termed as a janya of Gamanasrama the 53rd Melakarta.The composition &#8216;Kamalacharane&#8217; penned by G.N. Balasubramaniam is a favourite with musicians following his style. This number is played with confidence by Sanjeev.Tyagaraja&#8217;s monumental &#8216;Chakkaniraja&#8217; forms the core of this recording. The raga essay is a meaningful exercise with apt sancharas and pidis. Guru Kanyakumari&#8217;s approach is mirrored a lot in Sanjeev&#8217;s raga essay. The kriti and swarams are firmly played though a brief niraval would have made the fare more wholesome.The seasoned percussionists Mannargudi Eswaran (mridangam) and T.V.Vasan (ghatam ) churn out a good tani avarthanam in Adi tala (2 kalais ) for the Kharaharapriya composition. Their accompaniment for the rest of the songs is highly anticipatory and speaks of  their rapport with the violinist.Subramania Bharathi&#8217;s evergreen &#8216;Chinnanchirukiliye&#8217; in ragamalika, a Yamunakalyani Tamizh composition of Tanjore S. Kalyanaraman and N.S. Chidambaram&#8217;s &#8216;Kandanaalmudalai&#8217; in haunting Madhuvanti serve as desserts.Sanjeev&#8217;s playing is free from gimmicks and adheres to classical values. This disc offers aesthetic listening pleasure.
