VFans of Hindustani music in Kerala do not often get the chance to listen to live concerts of Hindustani maestros. As such the vocal concert by Ustad Faiyaz Khan, held at the IMA House, Kochi, was an excellent treat.Ustad Faiyaz hails from a family of Hindustani musicians from Dharwar in Karnataka and took his first lessons in Hindustani from his father, Ustad Abdul Khader Khan, himself an acclaimed sarangi player.Having also learnt the tabla from the age of 13, Ustad Faiyaz was the favoured percussionist for senior vocalists such as Bale Khan, Pandit Basavaraj Rajguru and Pandkit Rasiklal Andhariya.He learnt the sarangi from both his father and Pandit Ramnarayan and had his vocal training under stalwarts such as Pandit Ranganath Joshi and Ustad Altaf Hussain Khan. A versatile musician, indeed.Ustad Faiyaz started the recital with raag Pooriya Dhanaashree. The vocalist instantly struck a chord with the audience with the alap of this popular evening raag.After a brief exposition in Vilambit, he moved to the khayal in Vilambit Ek taal. Bearing testimony to his rich calibre and mastery over laya and sur, the rendition enthralled the packed gathering; more so when his pliant voice ran over the middle and upper octaves with ease. The next one in the repertoire was &#8216;Ab huva lalen mein to,' a chota khayal in raag Behag. The the spiritual message of the song was melodiously rendered.His next song, a thumri in the raag Mishra Peelu, was beautifully sung. Next on the agenda was a mellifluous chota khayal in the raag Malcauns. The Ustad's &#8216;bol-thaans' and &#8216;sur-thaans' were fully decorated with subtle nuances and rich gamaks.Own compositionThe versatile musician then surprised the listeners with his own composition set to Druth Ek taal in the raag Jaijaiwanti. The concert concluded with an enchanting bhajan in the raag Bhairavi. Ustad Faiyaz was well supported by ace percussionist Raghunath Nakod on the tabla, who embedded his drumming with colourful tonal variations.Ravindra Kattotti accompanied the vocalist on the harmonium. He had a perfect rapport with the singer and could reproduce all the nuances excellently.The concert was organised by the Fine Arts Society of the Bhrateey Sangeet Vidalay, Thripunithura.
