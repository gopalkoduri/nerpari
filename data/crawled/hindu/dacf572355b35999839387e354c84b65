VShantanu Bhattacharya's concert captured moments, where one could savour his guru. His performance included the repertoire of his first guru Prasun Bannerji, and had the makings of a scintillating session with Pt. Ajoy Chakraborty , in the great style of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Sahib. Shantanu performed with exuberance the challenging intricacies of the Patiala Gharana.The morning at the Little Play Coop began with the melodic strains of &#8216;Gunkali' in vilambit, madhya and dhrut laya, where the last piece , &#8220;Gao Gunkali Gunijan Mein Gao&#8221; showcased a wide variety in expression and technique.Distinctive alapsMiyan ki Todi was full of distinctive alaps, which spilled into three-four avartans in full meend and uchhals.He touched the higher notes, lacing them with bol-alaps and created a melody substantiating the raga in a great tradition. The taan patterns were varied and spectacular, restating and redefining the heights that an Ustad usually reaches. In short, Shantanu's performance was a picture-perfect recital reminiscent of his great musical lineage.The second half of the concert was an interactive session, during which Shantanu took ragas with similar swaras but with varying moods such as Jaunpuri and Darbari; Bihag and Maru Bihag; Multani and Miyan ki Todi and Bhopali and Deshkar. He spoke about the strong correlation between the time of the enunciation of the raga and its swaras- a correlation, he pointed out, that actually helped to unfurl a particular raga.For example in the raga Miyan ki Malhar, the combination of &#8216;ni dha ni sa' dramatises and denotes the coming of clouds. He also felt that Bahar cannot be sung, unless it is Spring and that Bhairav can never be performed in the evening. He also pointed out that occasionally, the composition hailed the ragas. Finally with the coming of Bhairavi, Shantanu demonstrated how all the thaats with their scales can be derived by shifting scales by one note.The two beautiful compositions from Bhairavi finally established that Shantanu had scaled great heights and finally would cement his place among India's top singers. On the tabla was Debashish, a prolific master of his genre and the two complimented each other perfectly.
