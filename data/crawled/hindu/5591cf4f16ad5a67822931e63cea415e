VThis album presents a unique selection of kritis in praise of  eight deities of Kerala temples. But this is cannot be branded  a devotional album.  Carnatic vocalist  Sreevalsan J. Menon has handpicked kritis sung in Carnatic concerts and some compos\u000aed in that format but never sung on the stage. What binds them together, apart from the theme,  is the stature of the vaggeyakars and the beauty of the compositions.This album, presented in pure Carnatic style to the regular kutcheri accompaniments is for the hardcore Carnatic music fan. There are some rare kritis rendered sensitively by Dr. Sreevalsan.Shadkala Govinda Marar&#8217;s composition &#8216;Rama mangala&#8230;&#8217; in Kedargowla, on Bala Narasimham of Ramamangalam is a rare kriti that has never been sung in the concert circuit. Popularised by eminent Sopanasangeetham exponent Trikkamburam Krishnankutty Marar, it has always been heard in the Sopanam style. Dr. Sreevalsan has not shed that format but ingeniously given it a Carnatic flavour.The other composition of significance in this album is &#8216;Saranga nayane&#8230;&#8217; in Saranga raga on the Mukkola Bhagavathy Temple, Changaramkulam, Malappuram district. Supposed to have been composed by one Ramapanivadan, who many believe is none other than Kunjan Nambiar, the composition has never been sung on the concert stage. The beautifully notated text by Panjabakesa Iyer, former principal of R.R. Sangita Sabha, Mylapore, perhaps made Dr. Sreevalsan&#8217;s job easier. This is certainly the pick of the eight kritis.Also included in the album are M. D. Ramanathan&#8217;s &#8216;Sagarasayana&#8230;&#8217; in Bagesri. Supposed to have written when MDR was in hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, it is a simple, grand composition on Sree Padmanabha Swami.Two kshetra kritis are by Swati Tirunal, &#8216;Palayamam&#8230;&#8217; in Khamas on Srikanteswaram Sivan and &#8216;Sreekumara&#8230;&#8217; in Atana on Kumaranelloor Durga. The other kritis  are &#8216;Neelavarna&#8230;&#8217; by Irayimman Thampi, &#8216;Saranam&#8230;&#8217; by Papanasam Sivan and &#8216;Sri Krishnam&#8230;&#8217; by Muthuswami Dikshitar.A good buy for  Carnatic music aficionado.K.
