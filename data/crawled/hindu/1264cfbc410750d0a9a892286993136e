VArasi-CDSumithra NitinCarnatic musicRs. 195.Sumithra Nitin, a talented vocalist is the disciple of vidhooshis Ananthalakshmi Sadagopan and T. Rukmini.Rajalakshmi Audio has recorded 14 songs sung by her and composed by Rajee Krishnan, a close relative of vidwan  V. V. Sadagopan who was a very popular musician during the middle years of the 20th century.The accompanists for this comapact disc are R. Hemalatha on the violin, J. Vaidyanathan on the mridangam and S.V. Ramani on the ghatam.The programme begins auspiciously with an invocatory composition on Lord Vinayaka appropriately tuned in Gambeera Nattai.The agenda comprises devotional verses of the various deities in the Hindu pantheon.The ragas such as Bouli, Abhogi, Charukesi, Devagandhari, Vachaspathi, Sama, Punnagavarali, etc. have a rich classical bearing that is in keeping with the emotions in the lyrics.Sumithra's voice is a pleasant blend of power, range, fluency and melody, While her musical expression is dotted with commendable karvais and brisk brighas.Her diction leaves nothing to be desired. Her brief raga cameos are pertinent that touch the core of the raga swaroopa.The songs by the author are reflective of her totally bhakti-oriented mind that has been given full rein in the sahithya.This audio album provides happy listening time.SULOCHANA PATTABHIRAMANBottom Template Starts
