VThe students of Sri R. R. Keshavamurthy Foundation are coming together to remember R. R. Keshavamurthy, a tall figure in the world of Carnatic music. He specialised in the seven-stringed violin. A student of Bidaram Krishnappa and contemporary of violinist Mysore T. Chowdiah, Keshavamurthy specialised in the seven stringed violin. He accompanied reputed musicians like M.D. Ramanathan, Ariyakudi, G.N.B. Musuri, Chambai and many others. He was also the recipient of the prestigious &#8220;Kanaka Purandara&#8221; award of Karnataka government Sangeetha Kalaratna from Bangalore Gayana Samaja. The books authored by him are a great contribution to the music world. The foundation will felicitate Prof. V. Ramaratnam of Mysore with &#8220;Saadanacharya&#8221; award along with Rs. 10,000 cash. Apart from music programmes, there will be a multi-media presentation of video-clippings of the legendary musician. The programme will be held at Seva Sadan, Malleswaram on Saturday evening and Sunday morning.
