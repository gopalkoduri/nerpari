VMusic aficionados converged at Saptaparni for a three-day workshop on yesteryears' Bhakti Ranjani (AIR) conducted by eminent scholar-musician Malladi Suribabu.&#8220;The objective of this workshop is to educate singers in classical music of different &#8216;vaggeyakaras' pre and post Thyagaraja. Many hold a misconceived notion that classical music did not exist prior to Thyagaraja. It was not so,&#8221; explained the maestro. &#8220;Classicism and tradition in music was not just born in a particular century. It has been handed over down the generations. The need for a guru to guide you in music which is different from a song is inevitable in the case of serious singing. This workshop offers a platform for all these principles I cherish.&#8221;The compositions he has been teaching were all broadcast on AIR five decades ago in the popular Bhakti Ranjani as a sort of wake-up call to many a household, said an elderly lady who was enthused about retuning herself to old-time favourites.Interspersing group singing and learning with brief lessons on the systematic way of learning Carnatic music, Malladi Suribabu was keen on notation prior to singing a kirthana. &#8220;It is to keep you grounded to real music. Otherwise, the singing turns airy. There is a depth, a pause at the right places, a high and low octave, a beat and rhythm to a song that is sung in a traditional manner. Only when you sing within the classical framework does it stay with you. That is the essence of classicism,&#8221; he enlightened the learners.He chose to present Nata and Vasantha ragas. Lucid delineation of the raga with fine tuning vocal chords to touch the high and low in a measured manner made Suribabu's workshop a wonderful experience. Saptaparni deserves a pat on the back for bringing in such educative events in music and arts from time to time.
