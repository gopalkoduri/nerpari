VAntonio Chainho&#8217;s Portuguese Guitar recital recently inaugurated the Bangalore School of Music&#8217;s 12th East West Encounter.This unusual instrument&#8217;s genesis is hazy: not a guitar at all, its bastardised origins lay claim to a flat-backed lute (related to the Renaissance cittern) and the English guitar, with some Moorish strain providing the proverbial tar brush.It became popular in the 18th century, a favourite accompaniment instrument at Court, with ladies learning to play it, as they would later the piano. Not a classical instrument, it had no established method of teaching and was therefore not taught at music conservatories, it&#8217;s playing technique being handed down personally. Excellence of execution is judged by the pressure the performer applies with artificial nails on the right index finger and thumb, on the six-paired steel strings over a moveable bone bridge, which give it the high piercing tone of an unrefined harpsichord.Since the 19th century, Portuguese composers and performers have used the instrument either for a kind of salon music or more typically as accompaniment to fado (roughly translated as &#8220;fate&#8221;), that Moorish-Iberian song genre, with its elaborately festooned vocal lines concentrating on feeling, and rousing popular imagination.Portuguese musicians are judged not only by technical expertise but also by their saudade, a misty mixture of love and sorrow that particularly characterises fado vocalists, any sentimentality counterbalanced by the Portuguese guitar&#8217;s projection and sustained sharp tone. Capable of being plaintive or strident, it ideally complements fado&#8217;s typical themes of love, protest or satire.Fascinated with the instrument from an early age, Chainho learned to play by ear.Inspired by maestros such as Armandinho, by the 1960s he was playing at fado houses and radio broadcasting. He formed his own group of guitarists and went on to recordings and accompanying famous performers.Deciding the instrument worthy of solo performance, he rearranged pieces for it.He has performed and recorded with artistes of different musical traditions, from classical (accompanying opera tenor Jose Carreras; recording with the London Symphony Orchestra) to contemporary jazz and blues.Extending the instrument&#8217;s scope, he has collaborated with different cultures, from Japanese to Spanish. On this trip, he is recording with sitar and tabla players.The instrument&#8217;s limited tonal range spans treble octaves and its often harsh metallic timbre needs mellower accompaniment. In this concert, classical guitarist Joao Oliveira very ably supplied the balance of bass notes and rhythm.Apart from Valsinha Mandada that was interspersed with classical fugue-like passages, for the most part the programme was popular in idiom, informed by strong melodic line (not surprising, given their fado and folk origins) and vibrant dance rhythms.The instrument&#8217;s conscribed range and Chainho&#8217;s repertoire made the performance more suitable for the informal atmosphere of a caf&#233; or lounge bar, than a formal concert platform, though that in no way denigrates the genre, or Chainho&#8217;s redoubtable technical mastery of the instrument. He shifted effortlessly from precisely delineated lyrical melody to a thrum of muted chords to swooping arpeggios, delighting guitar aficionados in the audience.
