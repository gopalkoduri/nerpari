VIt was by combining judiciously the ingredients of laya and learning that U. Srinivas presented a mandolin concert at  Abhisekham Convention Centre, Thripunithura.He began the concert with a dazzling &#8216;Mahaganapathi&#8217; in Gowla, which was packed with  kalpanaswaras. It was a delightful experience when the maestro traversed the lower and middle registers, and occasionally touched the upper ones too.Spicing up  oft-heard compositions with new nuances makes a  concert come alive and the instrumentalist accomplished it with a great amount of success, without deviating from the age-old conventional pattern.The portrayal of Sree Ranjini was  appealing on the strength of an artistically tight and intense execution. &#8216;Maarubalka&#8230;&#8217; in which Tyagaraja pleads  to the Lord to respond to his queries, was played by harmoniously blending the diction with the contours of the raga. Discreet improvisations that did not  mar the meaning of the lyrics  made it all the more enchanting.Lathangi came in gracefully  through &#8216;Marivere&#8230;,&#8217; composed by Pattanam Subrahmania Iyer. Swaras appeared in neatly sliced segments. &#8216;Vaagadheeswari,&#8217; formerly known as &#8216;Bhogachaayanaatta&#8217;  was delineated with a melodic perception.&#8216;Paramaatmudu&#8230;,&#8217; a philosophical composition by Tyagaraja, was exposed with slow strides, and embellished by chords, on the bass.Sankarabharanam was essayed in  lovely passages, winsome in tone and impressive in skill. &#8216;Swara raga sudhaarasa,&#8217; is said to have been composed by Tyagaraja with a purposeful focus on Alaapa padhathi with effulgent musical phrases. When Srinivas garnished it with swara patterns of Kanada, Bahudhari, Kaapi and Bindumalini, the mandolin recital reached its zenith.The Swati kriti &#8216;Visweswara&#8230;&#8217; (Sindhubhairavi) &#8216;Krishna nee begane&#8230;&#8217; (Yamuna Kalyani) and a Sai bhajan in Revathi followed. Srinivas rounded off his concert with a thillana in Desh composed by Lalgudi Jayaraman.V.V. Srinivasa Rao watchfully accompanied on the violin. The percussion provided by Madrimangalam Swaminathan (mridangam) and S.V. Ramani (ghatam) was appropriate.Prior to the  concert Srinivas was conferred  the Sangeeta Sampoorna title, while Balabhaskar was awarded the Mavelikkara Prabhakara Varma Memorial Yuva Sangeetha Prathiba title. Thespian Parassala Ponnammal was also honoured at the function organised in connection with the 34th annual programme of the Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha.

VLyrical strings:U. Srinivas makes it a point to spice up popular compositions with new nuances that do not transgress the conventional traditional frame of the raga.
