VWith Semmangudi fever in the air, Hamsadhwani has been doing its bit  to keep the memory of his music alive, with a tribute series spread over a year-long celebration of the late  vidwan&#8217;s centenary. And in the month of August, coinciding with \u000aSri Krishna Gana Sabha&#8217;s felicitation ceremony honouring her contribution as artist and guru, who better to represent the Semmangudi bani than the &#8216;sangeetha pitamaha&#8217;s venerable disciple, Parassala Ponnammal? Repository of over eight valuable decades of accumulated gnanam, Kerala&#8217;s pride and joy, the octogenarian vocalist now has Chennai&#8217;s musical cognoscenti hastening to her recitals.It was a field day for rasikas subscribing to undiluted classicism, as they gathered on the rain-wet lawns of the Indira Nagar Youth Hostel for an evening of &#8216;shastriya sangeetham&#8217; untouched by the demands of commercialism. Accompanied by her disciple, Bama Krishnan (vocal), Parassala Ponnammal&#8217;s rendition of the Anandabhairavi Ata tala varnam &#8216;Sami Neepai&#8217; (Veena Kuppaiyar) was chock-full of the raga&#8217;s mellow cadences, imbued with both azhuttam and bhava. Madhyamakala vigour powered a &#8216;rise and shine&#8217; &#8216;Gajaananayutham&#8217; (Vegavahini, Muthuswami Dikshitar) with a spirited volley of kalpanaswaras  finding their mark in each round.Manodharma in full spate, the Arabhi alapana emerged as a cascading profusion of prayogas, as each  phrase swept away the cobwebs from formula-weary minds.&#8216;Narasimha Mamava Bhagavan&#8217; (Swathi Tirunal) rejuvenated. How do you describe something that is  as soothing  as the breeze on your face? You  don&#8217;t have to.  You simply surrender to the experience,  as each phrase captures the essence of the raga. Thus did the artist sketch Pantuvarali, the sancharas touching upon the nishadham and opening a window to fresh vistas.A leisurely &#8216;Ramanatham Bhajeham&#8217; (Muthuswami Dikshitar) with succinct emphasis on each word of the sahitya, supported niraval and sarvalaghu kalpanaswara patterns that journeyed with insouciant ease to the eduppu at &#8216;Kumara Guruguha Mahitam.&#8217;A couple of warm-up phrases and suddenly  you were plunged into the very core of Syama Sastri&#8217;s magnificent Bhairavi Swarajathi, &#8216;Kamakshi.&#8217;Harikesanallur Muthaiah Bhagavathar&#8217;s &#8216;Sudhamayi&#8217; with chittaswaram, unleashed an effervescent Amritavarshini. The much-awaited main piece, Thodi raga, wore a mantle of dignity.Burnished phrases rolled out, each dip and swirl anchored by the weightiness of time-honoured pidis and 24-carat gamakas. Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s seldom heard kriti, &#8216;Sri Venkatesam,&#8217; was a masterpiece of sangathi construction, testimony to the heavyweight patanthara of the Semmangudi School.Sriram Kumar (violin) found scope for empathetic expression in the Pantuvarali alapana, his sustained bowing creating a comfort zone for the main artiste. Arun Prakash guarded kalapramanam with zealous care and wove interesting patterns in his compact,  time-conscious thani.At 84, vidushi Parassala\u000aPonnammal has seen music\u000aand musicians in their\u000afinest hour. Living through\u000athe golden era of Carnatic\u000amusic and being part of its\u000aevolution, this doyenne has\u000agreat achievements to her\u000acredit, yet is humility personified.\u000aSteeped in tradition,\u000aher music is timeless,\u000aupholding the highest tenets\u000aof classicism.The early years and my musical destinyMy father, a schoolmaster,\u000awas a connoisseur of\u000aclassical music. My lessons\u000abegan at the age of seven\u000aand my first gurus were Paramu\u000aPillai and Vaidyanatha\u000aIyer. Soon after, we\u000amoved to Parassala, our native\u000avillage, near Thiruvananthapuam.\u000aAn\u000aencouraging Professor Srinivasan\u000aurged me to enter\u000athe competition held on the\u000aoccasion of Maharaja Chithira\u000aTirunal's birthday celebrations.\u000aThe judges were a\u000aformidable phalanx of alltime\u000agreats including Muthaiah\u000aBhagavathar, Semmangudi,\u000aMusiri. Being a young\u000agirl, I was clueless about\u000atheir eminence and simply\u000asang what I knew - Dikshitar's\u000a`Kamalambam Bhajare'\u000ain Kalyani, with\u000aalapana and swaras. They\u000aasked me to sing melkala\u000aswaras, which I did. To my\u000autter surprise, I was awarded\u000athe first prize! I gave my\u000afirst concert with pakkavadyam\u000aand Muthaiah Bhagavathar\u000apresented a gold\u000amedal. On his advice, my father\u000aconsented to let me\u000ajoin the Swathi Tirunal Music\u000aCollege (founded in\u000a1939) in 1940.On joining Sri Swathi Tirunal College of Music, TiruvananthapuramI joined during the time\u000aMuthaiah Bhagavathar was\u000athe principal. Eminent vidwans\u000asuch as M.A. Kalyanakrishna\u000aBhagavathar,\u000aN.V. Narayana Bhagavathar\u000aand Velur Kumaraswami\u000aBhagavathar were our gurus\u000awho laid a solid foundation\u000ain kalpita and manodharma\u000asangeetam. It was a glorious\u000aage of dedicated musicianship.\u000aI qualified as `Gayaka'\u000aand as `Gana Bhooshanam,'\u000afirst rank.Memorable performancesIn 1940, thanks to Muthaiah\u000aBhagavathar's recommendation,\u000aI got my first\u000aradio programme (AIR, Tiruchi).\u000aFor the first time, my\u000aname was announced as Parassala\u000aPonnammal to distinguish\u000ame from another\u000aartist called Parur Ponnammal,\u000aand that's the story behind\u000amy `namakaranam.'\u000aWith regular broadcasts,\u000amine became a familiar\u000aname and I gave many sabha\u000aand wedding concerts in\u000aThanjavur, Madurai, Dindigul.\u000aMikes had not yet been\u000aintroduced and the voice\u000ahad to carry, loud and clear!\u000aI have also performed\u000aacross the length and\u000abreadth of Kerala at numerous\u000atemple festivals.Dedicated professor, college principal and guruI was appointed lecturer\u000ain 1952 - the first woman\u000aprofessor in the Swati Tirunal\u000aMusic College. During\u000amy tenure of 38 years, I\u000aserved as professor, then as\u000aPrincipal. I would always\u000areport on time, punctuality\u000abeing a trait inherited from\u000amy father. Once the bell\u000arang, anxious not to waste a\u000asingle moment, I would\u000atune the tanpura and begin\u000athe class. Semmangudi and\u000aGNB, who served successively\u000aas college Principal\u000anoted this and expressed\u000aappreciation. I have always\u000abelieved that encouragement\u000ais the best way to enthuse\u000astudents. No point\u000ascolding them. Instead, patience\u000ayields results. The\u000aslow learners need extra\u000aattention.Supportive familyMy mother Bhagavathi\u000aAmmal sang with `gnanam'.\u000aMy father R. Mahadeva\u000aIyer, would accompany me\u000ato concerts and play the tanpura.\u000aAfter my parents' lifetime,\u000ait was my beloved\u000ayounger sister who took\u000acare of my family and me,\u000afreeing me from household\u000aduties to concentrate on\u000amusic and my job.My husband, a great admirer\u000aof Semmangudi mama's\u000amusic, was a constant\u000apillar of support. My daughter\u000aand two sons sing well,\u000abut have taken up other professions.\u000aBy God's grace, I\u000ahave been blessed with a\u000awonderful and supportive\u000afamily.The Navaratri Mandapam experienceIn 2006, Prince Rama\u000aVarma requested me to sing\u000aat the Navaratri Mandapam,\u000aTrivandrum.I was taken aback. \u000aDeviating\u000afrom a tradition that\u000apermitted only male musicians,\u000athe Travancore royal\u000afamily's new decision would\u000amake me the first female\u000aartist to perform at the hallowed\u000avenue.I was 82 and retired from\u000aactive performance. Any\u000ainitial hesitation was overcome\u000aby the Prince's kind\u000aassurances and unstinting\u000aencouragement. Meantime,\u000amagazines and TV channels\u000abuzzed with interviews galore.\u000aSadly, about a month\u000abefore the kutcheri, my sister\u000apassed away. Overcoming\u000agrief, I performed on the\u000aopening day, singing the\u000aNavaratri krithi `Devi Jagat\u000aJanani' (Sankarabharanam).\u000aIn 2007, I sang `Pahijanani'\u000a(Nattakurinji). The\u000aunique ambience, singing in\u000athe presence of divinity by\u000athe flickering light of oil\u000alamps . an unforgettable\u000aexperience bestowed only\u000aby `deiva anugraham' and\u000a`gurukripa.'A video of the recital,\u000auploaded on the internet\u000a(youtube.com) at Prince\u000aVarma's initiative, triggered\u000aa renewed surge of interest\u000aand I was flooded with\u000akutcheri offers. Thus, I was\u000a`rediscovered' by sabhas\u000aand rasikas.Titles and awardsInclude Gayaka Ratnam\u000a(Swati Tirunal Sangeetha\u000aSabha), Kerala Sangeet Natak\u000aAcademy award and Fellowship,\u000aSangeetha Ratnam\u000a(Sruti Bharathi) and most\u000arecently, Sangeetha Paramacharya\u000aand Sanskruti\u000aaward (first recipient).Inheriting the Semmangudi legacyI began learning from\u000aSemmangudi mama when\u000ahe was the Principal and\u000acontinued as his sishya.\u000aSuch a wonderful guru! His\u000amethod of teaching was so\u000athorough that the composition\u000awould be imprinted in\u000aone's mind.Even today, I recall with\u000aperfect clarity the order and\u000astructure of sangatis. I try to\u000ateach my students the same\u000away and feel happy when\u000athey say that the kritis\u000alearnt from me are the ones\u000athey remember best. There\u000ais no substitute for learning\u000adirectly from the guru.Semmangudi mama once\u000acomplimented me on doing\u000afull justice to my roles as\u000aguru/artist and `grihalakshmi'-\u000akind words that I will\u000aalways treasure.
