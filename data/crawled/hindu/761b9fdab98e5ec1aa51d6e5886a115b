VThe music programme commenced with a harmonium solo by Ravindra Katoti, a highly sought-after harmonium artiste who has accompanied many of the leading vocalists of the country. A senior disciple of the harmonium virtuoso Pt. Bijapure, Dr. Katoti is a well- known artiste in the Hindustani concert circuits of Karnataka. Katoti chose the popular afternoon melody Raga Bhimpalasi for his rendition. In his expansive, imaginative delineation of Bhimpalasi in the Vilambit Khayal &#8220;Ab to badi der bhayi&#8221;, Katoti illuminated the quintessential aspects of the raga, highlighting many poignant phraseologies, reminiscent of the numerous abhangs, devaranama and bhajans in the raga. His taans drew a lot of applause from the audience. The drut composition in adha teen tal, a rhythmic cycle of 16 beats was noteworthy for its exuberant appeal. Pt. Uday Raj Karpur provided the tabla accompaniment with gusto and elan.Katoti concluded his harmonium solo recital with Rag Des. Pt. Uday Karpur&#8217;s impeccable rendition of the tala Deepchandi enhanced the rhythmic brilliance of the composition.The piece de resistance of the evening was the much awaited vocal recital of Pt. Kaivalya Kumar Gurav, a prominent vocalist and exponent of the Kirana Gharana and the son of Pt. Sangameshwar Gurav who belongs to the Parampara of luminaries like the late Ustad Abdul Karim Khan and late Pt. Bhaskar Buva Bakhle. Pt. Kaivalya Kumar began his recital with the vilambit khayal composition &#8220;Ban ban jaavu balam&#8221; in the evening melody raga Purya Dhanashri. The aesthetic appeal of his intense, meticulously embellished, meditative exposition of the raga could have been enhanced if the vocalist had articulated the literary text of the khayal bandish with more clarity. Pt. Kaivalya Kumar demonstrated the use of &#8216;base&#8217; and &#8216;tonal&#8217; voices which are the distinctive features of Kirana gayaki in his alaap and bol taans with laudatory expertise and erudition. His masterful rendition of the strikingly impactful sufi bandish &#8220;Khwaja kutubuddin ke darbar me baite rahu&#8221; in drut teental transported the audience to the heights of rhapsody. The chota khayal composition &#8220;Khush raho sanam mera&#8221; in drut ektal in rag Purya Dhanasri was marked by some scintillating taankari.The thumri composition in rag Khamaj composed by Pt. Bindadin Maharaj was remarkable for the tappa flavour. In the dulcet voice of Pt. Kaivalya Kumar, the exquisite shringar ras of the thumri &#8220;Eri Saiyya tore mai na manungi&#8221; found a nuanced expression. Pt. Kaivalya Kumar did not disappoint the audience and yielded to the farmayish of the connoisseurs by rendering a devaranama &#8220;Endu kanuve guruve&#8221; in rag Durga and a moving vachana by Akka Mahadevi &#8220;Bittenendare Bidadi Maye&#8221; in rag Bageshree. His mastery over some of the rare and &#8216;anavat&#8217; ragas was clearly discernible in the immaculate delineation of a difficult raga like Sawani.The two compositions in Sawani: &#8220;Khelata shivashankar, karat tandav esha girisha&#8221; and &#8220;Aaj mukha chandra&#8221; remarkable for their sublime layakari and sahitya were the creations of his father Pt. Sangameshwar Gurav. Pt. Kaivalyakumar succeeded in bringing his vocal recital to a sublime climax by a moving rendition of &#8220;Jamuna ke teer kanhare&#8221; in rag bhairavi. Pt. Uday Raj Karpur&#8217;s tabla accompaniment bedazzled the audience. The programme also showcasedRavindra Katoti&#8217;s abilities as a solo harmonium artiste and accompanist par excellence.
