VT. K. SADASIVANIt was a unique experience for music lovers of Kochi. A group of Baul singers from Bengal enchanted them with Baul folk songs that spoke of love and peace.Baul singers express the essential ideas of their philosophy in simple but expressive language.The Baul musicians in the group led by Parvathy Baul comprised Madan Das Vairagya, Lalu Fakir, Sunil Das (all from Murshidabad district of West Bengal), Sekender Sheikh, a renowned flautist from Bengal.Parvathy Baul, an Assamese by birth, who now lives in Nedumangad in Thiruvananthapuram, captivated the audience with her intense recital.Singing the folk tunes to the rhythm of her anklets, she simultaneously played the ekthara, a single-stringed instrument, and the the duggi, a drum tied to her waist.Her deep and intense voice struck a chord among the listeners.The concert jointly organised by BEAME (Bank Employees Arts Movement, Ernakulam) and Centre for Studies in Culture and Heritage, Cochin Corporation took off with a solo drumming of the shree kolby Sunil Das.Madan Das Vairagya  enthralled the audience by playing the ananda lahiri, a four-stringed instrument, which accompanied his songs.Lalu Fakir sang a few Baul songs accompanied by the dotara, a stringed instrument made of wood and leather.A duet by Parvathy Baul and Madan Das was enchanting.  So was a solo flute recital by Sekender Sheikh.Bottom Template Starts
