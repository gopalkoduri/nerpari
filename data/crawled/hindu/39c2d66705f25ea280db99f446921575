VThe Nishagandhi Festival organised by the Department of Tourism, Kerala, sought to promote some of our rich cultural traditions. This was also part of the UN-ICCR partnership project to popularise and preserve different gharanas of Hindustani classic\u000aal music.Pandit Keshav Raghunath Talegaonkar, an exponent of the Gwalior gharana, began the music programmes of the festival with &#8216;Sarva Mangal Mangalya.&#8217; He  rendered three compositions in the evening raga Shri, with elan. The first two pieces were devotional compositions in Jhaptal (10 beats) &#8211; &#8216;Prabhu ke charan kamal mishdin dharat dhyan&#8217; dedicated to Lord Shiva and the second, &#8216;Sri Gurudatta ko dhyan,&#8217; to Lord Dattatreya.Accompanied by his daughters Megha on the surmandal and Shubra on the harmonium,  Talegaonkar showed his mastery by presenting the rare composition of two ragas &#8211; Basant and Bahar, &#8216;Aaya Basant Aya.&#8217; Shutin Katgade accompanied on the tabla.  Talegaonkar&#8217;s wife, Pratibha, an accomplished artiste in her own right, performed solo at the festival.Captivating the audience in the latter half of the evening was versatile ghazal singer Talat Aziz. He opened his concert with &#8216;Heh chhidi baat.&#8217; He then moved on &#8216;Asar Usko Zara Nahin Hota&#8230;,&#8217; the opening number of his latest album &#8216;Caravan-E-Gazal. &#8217;Given his ability to interact with audiences, Talat regaled the packed auditorium with anecdotes and music of his long career. Talat went back 30 years, singing the first ghazal of his career, &#8216;Tujhsa pehle na kabhi koi hamdam dekha &#8230;&#8217; Adding flavour to the rendition was his explanation of the ghazals as he sang along.Moving on from his favourite &#8216;sher,&#8217; &#8216;Aankho se ho bayan &#8230;,&#8217; and &#8216;Zindagi jab bhi teri bazm&#8230;&#8217;  (in the film  &#8216;Umrao Jaan&#8217;), Talat changed the tempo with &#8216;Rukh se thehra hua tufani&#8230;&#8217;  to the more upbeat &#8216;Piite hain nazar se roz magar&#8230;.&#8217; The weekend at Nishagandhi progressed from solo performances to Jugalbandis.Outstanding musicians such as  Jayanthi Kumaresh,  Pandit Ronu Muzumdar, Pandit Sanjeev Abhyankar and  Ashwini Bhide Deshpande made the Jugalbandis a rare treat. The magic of the veena and the flute permeated the auditorium during the first half of the evening. Both Dr. Jayanti and Ronu Mazumdar wove magic with their synchronisation and deft handling of the instruments while playing &#8216;Kalyankaari,&#8217; also known as &#8216;Yaman.&#8217; Starting with a subdued but elaborate alaap,  they moved on to &#8216;Mishra Peelu,&#8217; a light semi-classical piece.Patri Satheesh Kumar on the mrindangam and Sudhir Pandey on the tabla flawlessly accompanied the  artistes.   Sanjeev from the Mewati gharana and  Dr. Ashwini from the Jaipur gharana enlivened the latter half of the evening with &#8216;Jasrangi.&#8217;Sanjeev  explained that  &#8216;Jasrangi&#8217; was a Jugalbandi  concept developed by Pandit Jasraj, which is based on the system of &#8216;Moorchanas,&#8217; where two singers, without making a compromise in their respective scales, sing together.The duo began with Dr. Ashwini singing the  morning raga &#8216;Shuddhadaiwat Lalit&#8217; and Sanjeev rendering the evening raga  &#8216;Puriya Dhanashree.&#8217; Rendition of &#8216;Mairi Shyama shyam ratat&#8230;&#8217; and  &#8216;Apne sakhi na sou puchat &#8230;&#8217;  cast a melodious spell on the audience. Following this was &#8216;Rasa barsat tore ghar&#8217;  in two ragas.  While Ashwini took up Abhogi, Sanjeev rendered Kalavati.  They concluded the recital with  a bhajan &#8216;Ab main nacho bahut Gopal.&#8217;The concluding programme was an instrumental extravaganza that combined classical and contemporary schools of music.  Shanmugha troupe led by Karaikudi Mani (mridangam) comprised V. Suresh (ghatam), B.V. Balasai (flute) B.V. Raghavendra Rao (violin), U.P. Raju (mandolin) and V.B. Madhusodanan (tabla).They played two  compositions of Harikesanelloor Muthaiyya Bhagavathar,  one of which was a fusion between Jazz and Carnatic music. It was followed by two pieces composed by Karaikudi Mani called &#8216;Relax&#8217; based on ragas Bouli and Kapi, B.V. Balasai&#8217;s &#8216;Springs&#8217; based on Kedaram and also &#8216;Three nine.&#8217;Later, the audience was regaled by a composition by musicians John Keizyn Neptune and Alsitair Spence and by  saxophonist Sandy Evan.The highlight of the evening  was a percussion ensemble with  Mattannur Sankaran Kutty Marar (chenda), Karaikudi Mani (mridangam) and V. Suresh (ghatam). The festival was truly was a rare and welcome treat.
