VOur own younger generation artists are able to excel in creativity as well as erudition in classical music as never before. Sattiraju Venu Madhav's recent Carnatic recital for Kalasagaram is case in point.His manodharma displayed confidence and control over the medium, his alapana was stylistic, delving into the nuances of the raga, the choice of compositions was varied showing his versatility.The highlight of the concert was the ragam, tanam, pallavi which outshone all other kritis.His impromptu pallavi was a cut above the rest and the manner of rendition, the &#8216;countdown' towards the culmination was admirable.Detailed elaborationThe Shanmukhapriya soared sweetly to subtle highs as he expanded the minute facets of the raga, bringing in his cultivated style which was not the run-of-the-mill. The tanam opened on a short, low key in rhythmic syllables of two making its way up to a longer and speedy tempo. It was of optimum duration though it could have been a little longer.Venu Madhav made up for this by giving us a wonderful pallavi which he composed using the term kalasagaram (with due respect to the organization!) &#8211; Sangeeta sagaramu; geeta, vadya, nritya kalasagaramu, ending every line with the raga he chose to render. It was a commendable piece of creativity!s, we were led through the Hindolam with a touch of the Malkose, Valaji, and Hameer Kalyani. The flow of swaras was gracious as they lent their way into the pallavi again.The taniavartanam by T.P. Balasubramanian was apt and steady. K. Saikumar on the violin proved a fitting accompanist to the vocalist.Venu Madhav opened the concert with the customary varnam in Bhairavi (Ata talam) and went on to Hamsadhwani Abeesta varada&#8230; a Thyagaraja kriti.Classical with the newHe chose to alternate the new set of Annamacharya keertanas that he had set to ragas with a Dikshitar or a Thyagaraja. So, it was a straight rendition of Samasarame melu sakala janulukunu&#8230; in Aandolika, followed by Dikshitar's Rajagopalam bhajeham in Mohana where he did fairly commendable manodharma. Yentha muddo, yentha sogaso&#8230; in Bindumalini was easy on the ear, by virtue of its inherent sweetness and lucid lyric.Kadukunti&#8230; (Annamacharya) in Saama was smooth and soft while the neraval ( Padmapaani pai nee&#8230;) was impressive in the Kannada which came soon after.Bhaja govindam&#8230; in Yaman enhanced the philosophic appeal of the verses.A little more clarity in rendition of the lyric in particular would have further enhanced the recital, not to speak of better acoustics at the venue.His confidence and composure came to the fore, when he was disturbed rather ruthlessly by a listener challenging a particular composition being attributed to Thyagaraja which was in bad taste going by &#8216;sabha maryada'.
