VA. SANGAMESWARANSopanam, a music sabha dedicated to Carnatic music, at Nellayi, near Thrissur, recently organised a music concert by Sencottah Hariharasubramanian. Disciple of Sethalapathy Soundaram Bhagavathar and Sreemushnam Rajarao, Hariharasubramanian presented a concert that was marked by enthusiasm and exuberance. He seems to have a strong affinity towards Sampradaya bhajans.  One of the noteworthy features of the concert was that the kritis rendered were mostly of recent composers.The concert began with the magnum opus of Pachamiriyam Adiyappa  -  `Viribhoni' the Ada tala varnam in Bhairavi. He embellished it  by singing in the `thisragathi' also.Invocation to GaneshaInvocation to Lord Ganesha came in the form of `Varavallabha ramana,' a GNB kriti in Hamsadwani. Theswarapassages he added to this kriti, incorporating various permutations and combinations, added pep to the concert.A clean steady rendition of `Dinamanivamsa' (Harikamboji) with its characteristic madhyamakala tempo shed light on the ability of the performer in handling such kritis.Karnaranjini, a raga that is usually sung during the fag end of concerts,  was taken for detailed exposition with its characteristic phrases and the kriti `Vanchadomune' of Muthiah Bhagavathar was rendered. Seasoned violinist T.H. Subramanian  played a mellow Karnaranjini and Kalyani. B. Jayaram (mridangam) and P.L. Sudheer (ghatam) handled the percussion.A verse from `Kandar anubhoothi,' a melting Sindhu bhairavi (`Manathil' by Tanjavur Sankara Iyer) and a Thillana in Hamsanandi, composed by Sreemushnam Rajarao, comprised the final segment.Bottom Template Starts
