VR ama is adored. An incarnation of the omniscient almighty, he exemplified and stood as an exemplar of all virtue. His heroic life triggered the poetic genius Valmiki to reveal the evolvement of the Aadikavya Ramayana in chaste poetic idiom in Sanskrit. It continues to be a perennial source of inspiration to poets and writers. No wonder, it has been told and retold many in many languages innumerable number of times. &#8220;The present book titled Ramatatwam, in the simplest possible Telugu and in concise form, attracts attention and makes its reading interesting,&#8221; said Sriman K. Sivananda Murty releasing the book. He was chief guest at the function specifically held for the purpose last Wednesday at Sree Kodanda Ramalayam in Visalakshi Nagar in Visakhapatnam.Vedula Subrahmanya Sastry who acted as the chairperson explicated how Lord Siva and Ramabhakta Anjaneya were the only two who could fully discern Ramatatwam. He was happy that the venerable writer-poet, Chavali Seetha Ramaanjaneya Murty who authored the book, evolved it as an erudite panegyric.Former A.U. professor (Telugu) Dr. K. Malayavasini reviewing the contents explicated how Chavali picturesquely visualized Ramatatwam under nine heads emulating Paanuganti Kavi who dramatized Ramakadha under four heads. Diligently, Chavali also leaned on the discerning analysis brought out by Kavisamrat Viswanadha in his Kalpavriksham, Ramadas in his Daasaradhi Satakam, Karunasree in his poetic kavyas and so on besides Bhaskara Ramayana, she expounded. The first copy of the book was presented to Chavali's father-in-law K. Suryabhaskara Rao who worked hard for two decades for the development of the Ramalaya in Visalakshi Nagar.A.R.S
