VNeyveli Santhanagopalan cast a mesmerising spell on his audience with a whip-crack Panthuvarali (Sambho Mahadeva of Tyagaraja). The vocalist was obviously in an upbeat mood which manifested itself both as sprightliness in singing and cheerful demeano\u000aur &#8212; waving towards violinist M.A. Sundaresan for  the words &#8216;Gopura vasa Sundaresa.&#8217;Santhanagopalan had three main offerings for his audience &#8212; Panthuvarali, Ritigowla (Janani Ninnu Vina of Subbaraya Sastri) and an RTP in Shanmukhapriya. Panthuvarali and Shanmukhapriya were brilliant. The only exception was the approach taken in swara singing. While the Panthuvarali piece had all the tala acrobatics, they were rushed through in the RTP, with an eye on the clock. This approach conflicts with the standard audience expectation. One might have preferred an early piece like the Panthuvarali not to have lost its soothing flow to  a number game.  The laya  expedition could have been reserved for the RTP. Nevertheless, it was thoroughly enjoyable and Sundaresan contributed to it in no mean measure.Only when it came to the central piece of the concert &#8212; Ritigowla &#8212; did Santhanagopalan appear to have fallen short of expectations. Despite its technical perfection, the alapana did not fully capture the beauty of the raga and this had perhaps to do with the speed of the singing. This is surprising because Santhanagopalan is one artiste who sets great store by giving his audience a deep, meditative experience &#8212; a non-conformist in today&#8217;s world of egregious talent-displays. Perhaps another tactic error was in the choice of &#8216;Janani Ninnu Vina,&#8217; a song immortalised by Semmangudi. Any singing, no matter how good, is bound to pale against that benchmark.The other notable components of the concert were the opening Saveri varnam and Nada tanumanisam (Chittaranjani, Tyagaraja), a unique raga that does not take the upper &#8217;sa.&#8217; Santhanagopalan deserves standing ovation for his Chittarajnani swaras. Truly superb.On the mrigangam and ganjira were Umayalpuram Sivaraman and B.S. Purushotaman. During thani, a sumptuous affair, a visibly overawed Purushothaman watched Sivaraman as the maestro&#8217;s fingers flew over the mridangam.
