VAnanthapadmanabhan always creates a ripple among his listeners as he often comes up with novel ways of playing the veena. His raga creations and compositions make him a favourite of lovers of fine music.His  veena recital was held at Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha, Thripunithura, in memory of vocalist Rathnam Thampuran and V.V.M. Vasudevan Nambuthiripad.  He began with his own varnam &#8216;Saraseeruha&#8217; in Saraswathi. The piece gelled well with the eventide.The delineation of Natta turned out to be a nice preamble when it was garnished with  flourishes and swaras grafted to &#8216;Saraseeruhaasana Priye,&#8217; composed by Puliyur Doraiswamy Iyer. Abhogi  was followed by &#8216;Nannubrova,&#8217; composed by Tyagaraja.The depiction of Subha Panthuvarali showed how expressive and multidimensional Carnatic music is when it is not presented solely for mass appeal.The contours of the raga were cleverly etched on the veena, with its subtle nuances conjuring up the stately raga image.The ease with which thaanam was played in three tempos was sustained when he presented Tyagraja&#8217;s &#8216;Ennaallu&#8217; (misra chaappu). Pattanam Subrahmania Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;Raghuvamasa&#8217; in Kathana Kuthoohalam was followed by ragamaalika-thaanam in a  North Indian style of rendition. Bagesree, Syam Kalyan, Sindhu Bhairavi, Kafi and Behaug were delineated  in this piece.Ananthapadmanabhan wrapped up the recital with his own thillana in Madhuvanthi.  Rarely is a &#8216;thani&#8217; played in chaappu.Palakkad Maheshkumar played the mridangam with flair as Kottayam Unnikrishnan joined him on the ghatom
