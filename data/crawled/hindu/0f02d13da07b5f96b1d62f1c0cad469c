VA jugalbandhi, under the aegis of Progressive Art and Literature Organisation of the Thripunithura wing, was a sumptuous musical treat to rasikas.Jayadevan (grandson of lyricist Abhayadev on the violin) joined hands with Kolkatta-based Debjit Chakravarti (sitar), Suba Jyoti Guha (tabla) and Neyveli Venkitesh (mridangam) to take the listeners on a captivating musical journey.Jayadevan, settled in Toronto in Canada, adhered to the traditional style, except for a brief session of Western &#8216;Vibrati,&#8217; when dealing with Thaanam. The musical evening started with Hamsadhwani, and a composition set to Eka thalam. The essence of the raga surfaced in downward and upward flourishes on the violin. Debjit Chakravarti, adhering himself to the pristine Gayaki style, portrayed an alap and gath that had a contemplative air of repose around it. He did not indulge in an excessive display of alankars.As both the artistes were  anchored in their own respective traditions, the listeners were treated to the patent notes inherent in the two systems of Indian music.Then it was Jayadevan&#8217;s turn to depict Kharaharapriya, which meandered in with the soft cadence of a rivulet or gurgled like a swift flowing river. A composition by Bhadrachalam Ramadas too came in its wake. Debjit responded with Kafi, a parallel, from the North. He successfully brought in the succulence of the raga, combining it with the salubrious features of Vishnupur and Rampur Senia gharanas he had picked up from Pt. Monilal Nag and Santhosh Banerjee.Swati Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Gopalaka Pahimam&#8217; in Revagupthi  was bowed on the violin before Bhibhas (Bhairav That) found its way on the sitar.  Both the artistes  participated  with zeal to enliven the latter portion of the composition, building it up to reach  a crescendo.Charukeshi is a migrant raga to the North, which has no counter part in  Hindustani music. The sitarist portrayed it  convincingly, with proper stress on Vaadhi, Anuvaadhi and Amsa swaras. A vibrant thanam was  followed by a Pallavi. It was countered by Jod-Jala-Gath on the sitar, and when the duo played  some passages in unison, it turned out to be a real Jugalbandhi.Sawal-jawab between the percussionists   enthrals  rhythm lovers. Neyveli Venkitesh, trained by Kandaswamy in the Palani Subramanaia Pillai style, and Suba Jyothi Guha, an exponent of the Punjab gharana, vied with one another in making the ensemble a memorable one.
