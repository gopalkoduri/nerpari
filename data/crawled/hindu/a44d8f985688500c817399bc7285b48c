VV. KALADHARANOver the last couple of decades, the north-south dialogue in Indian classical music has flourished.Renu Jain, disciple of Pandit Uma Shankar Mishra,  recently gave several recitals in central Kerala. One of them was in Palakkad where she captivated the listeners with her classicism and exemplary devotion.The aalap of jodh-tsala  played on the Sitar in raga abhogi, in the jub tal of 10 beats, the slow tempo rendition proved her command over the language of instrumental music.In the theen tal (16 beats), she showcased the clarity ofgamakasand precision inbhava.This was followed by Dhun similar to Javali in raga Bhairavi. If the main perquisite of a musician is to transcend the techniques and arithmetic purity of classical music, then  Renu has them in abundance.For her, music is not a trade. It is an act of self-purification. Winner of many national and international awards,  she has been travelling round the world and giving recitals as a gesture of charity.Tranquillity and harmony through culture is her mission.Bottom Template Starts
