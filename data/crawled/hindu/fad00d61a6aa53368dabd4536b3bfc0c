VVechoor C. Shankar,\u000aaccompanied by B.\u000aK. Raghu (violin)\u000aand Bangalore Ramnath\u000a(mridanga), presented\u000aa vocal concert at the\u000aIndiranagar Sangeetha\u000aSabha, recently."Samidayajuda", the\u000aadi thala varna in Kedaragoula,\u000aand "Mahaganapathim"\u000ain Natta, with\u000awhich the recital began,\u000awere indicative of a mellow\u000astyle steeped in tradition\u000aand classicism.\u000aSwathi Thirunal's "Gopalaka\u000aPahimam" in Revagupthi\u000aand misra chapu\u000athala prefaced an enticing\u000aalapana of Abheri that included\u000aa series of nuanced\u000aphrases around the gandhara,\u000apanchama, nishada,\u000athara sthayi shadja and\u000aabove, followed by "Bhajarere\u000aManasa". "ParipalayaSaraseeruhalochana", the\u000aSwathi Thirunal composition,\u000awas suffixed with\u000aan imaginative neraval,\u000aand kalpana swaras that\u000aaccented the free flow of\u000amanodharma rather than\u000aan excess of rhythmic calculations,\u000aat "Sreepadmanabha"."Vandanamu Raghunandana"\u000ain Shahana was\u000asucceeded by a meditative\u000aexploration of Thodi,\u000atouching upon each note\u000aand introducing long\u000apauses where warranted,\u000aas it progressed steadily\u000afrom the lower to the medium\u000aand higher octaves.\u000aThe Deekshithar krithi\u000a"Sreekrishnam Bhaja Manasa",\u000asung at a sedate\u000apace, was supplemented\u000awith kalpana swaras in\u000athe second speed at "Pankajasanadideva\u000aMahitham"\u000aand a thani\u000aavarthana. The concert\u000acould, however, have\u000abeen elevated to a higher\u000alevel of sumptuousness\u000awith the inclusion of a neraval,\u000athe lack of which\u000awas keenly felt. Throughout\u000athe concert, the vocalist's\u000amandate was\u000afaithfully executed by the\u000aaccompanying artistes,\u000awho excelled in their respective\u000aroles.Samarpanam hosted a\u000avocal concert last week by\u000aS. P. Ramh, accompanied\u000aby M.S.Govindaswamy\u000a(violin), Tumkur Ravishankar\u000a(mridanga) and\u000aTumkur Shashishankar\u000a(ghata).Lalgudi Jayaraman's\u000avarna in Huseni raga and\u000aadi thala, "Kannanai Manivannanai",\u000aset the tone\u000afor a performance that\u000ashowcased a wholesome\u000aaspect of the Carnatic idiom\u000awithout exaggerated\u000aornamentation or affectation.\u000aThe Deekshithar\u000acompositions "Mahaganapathim"\u000ain Natta and\u000a"Sree Saraswathi" in\u000aArabhi were followed by a\u000abrief alapana of Nayaki,\u000areplete with the tender\u000atouches crucial to its\u000aidentity, and Thyagaraja's\u000a"Nee Bhajanagana" in adi\u000athala. Mukhari was next,\u000aelaborated with due emphasis\u000aon its distinctive\u000aphrases, and followed by\u000a"Enthanine Varnimthunu"\u000ain rupaka thala, augmented\u000aby a deeply\u000aevocative neraval.\u000aDeekshithar's `Kamakshi'\u000ain Simhendramadhyamam\u000araga and rupaka\u000athala was preceded by a\u000abrief alapana, and followed\u000aby a lilting `Kelano\u000aHari Thalano' in Surutti.The main raga of the\u000aevening, Shankarabharana,\u000awas expanded in meticulous\u000afashion with a\u000avariety of attractive\u000aphrases around the gandhara\u000aand panchama, specifying\u000athe different\u000ashades of the madhyama,\u000aand culminating in a profusion\u000aof sancharas\u000aaround the thara sthayi\u000ashadja, though the notes\u000aabove were only briefly\u000aindicated before the final\u000adescent. Shyama Shastri's\u000a"Sarojadalanethri" in adi\u000athala was rendered with a\u000abeautifully crafted neraval\u000aat "Samagana Vinodini".While the kalpana swaras\u000ain the first speed ended\u000awith a raga bhava\u000ainfused segment covering\u000athe entire gamut, the second\u000aspeed included avarthanas\u000aof diminishing\u000alength ending at the gandhara,\u000awith excellent support\u000afrom the\u000aaccompanying artistes
