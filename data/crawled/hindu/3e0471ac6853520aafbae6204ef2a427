VKolluru Vandana, for instance has found Chennai extremely congenial and her concert at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan recently was well-attended and she did not disappoint the audience.Commencing her recital with &#8216;Sri Raghukula&#8217; (Hamsadhwani-Tyagaraja), Vandana quickly  settled in her groove to sing a short indicative alapana for Harikhambodi (Entharani-Tyagaraja). The rendering of sangatis in the prescribed progressive order and niraval at &#8216;Seshudu&#8217; communicated bhava-sowkhyam.The plentiful array of swaras here and later for Bhairavi (Balagopala-Dikshithar) were marked by  an effortlessness, the singer smooth-sailing from  one stratum  to another with clever rounding off phrases, all  well within the domain of aesthetics.Parvathi Ninnu (Kalkada-Syama Sastri) has an inherent ebullience in its nadai that was captured in its entirety.The Bhairavi alapana with all its brigas, phrases and asaivus was soft and mellow.Vandana&#8217;s flair for the pallavi and her deep understanding of its intrinsic logic were manifest as she presented one (Thisra Jathi Roopakam with Misra Nadai) in Behag preceded by an alluringly phrased alapana and a thanam of fairly decent proportion.The swara clarity makes the chittaswaram for &#8216;Nenarunchinanu&#8217; (Malavi-Tyagaraja) a delight.&#8216;Muddukrishna Me Mudham&#8217; (Jenjuti-Oothukadu) was enchanting with a  lilting voice modulation and the Thillana (Valaji-Lalitha Sivakumar) had a rhythmic sway making the concert content-rich.K.V.Krishna (violin) was completely at home and shed all inhibitions  during the Behag alapana and thanam and  responded  more than adequately during the swara exchanges.Mangalagiri Sridhar (mridangam) exploited the thani phase,  his  approach generally pleasant.This concert was part of the Ugadi series held under the aegis of YACM (Youth Association for Classical Music).
