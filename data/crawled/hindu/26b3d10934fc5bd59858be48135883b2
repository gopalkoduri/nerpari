VMorsing, a tiny musical instrument that occupies a prominent place in Indian classical music, is an ancient instrument.Morsing, whose actual name is Moorechang, is basically a Rajasthani folk instrument used very often in their folklore music.Born in Rajasthan, the instrument was taken up in  South India and is often used as a sub accompaniment to the mridangam during classical music concerts.This percussion instrument also has its presence in the European world and some other parts of the world.In India very few artistes have taken up playing it as their profession as it is difficult and risky to perform and excel in.Morsing is the only instrument in Indian classical music which cannot produce sound on its own.The tongue is the basic mode which oscillates inside the mouth transforming the vibrations created by the string to sounds.The successful performance of 24 hours&#8217; non-stop morsing marathon yagnam for achieving Guinness Book of World Record by Satya Sai was a unique feat.Ghantasala Satya Sai, an eminent morsing player, besides B.V.S. Prasad and Srinivas Gopalan in Andhra Pradesh, has successfully accompanied many stalwarts like L. Subramanyam, M. Balamuralikrishna, Yesudas, Nedunuri Krishnamurthy, Nookala and Shivamani. About meeting and performing for L. Subramaniam,Sai says he&#8217;s &#8216;lucky to be part of his team today and touring with him all over the world.&#8221;Apart from performing at prestigious music centres, Satya Sai has also performed before eminent spiritual and political personalities.The morsing marathon by Satya Sai at Malkajgiri during the Thyagaraja fest witnessed a galaxy of music experts participating in this unique feat.
