VHarishnarayan and Shivaram sang at Ganabharathi in Mysore, accompanied by Veena Suresh (violin), Mandya Sudharashan (mridanga) and Ramanujan (morsing).The general approach upheld the lyrical depth of all the compositions they presented. Even the method of presenting the varna, &#8220;Vanajaksha Ninne Kori&#8221; (Mandaari-Vasudevacharya), enriching it with majestic gamakas while retaining clarity, was another proof of their unremitting commitment to adhere to the composer&#8217;s vision, without in any way disfiguring the moods nested in such stupendous works.Mahavaidyanatha Iyer&#8217;s &#8220;Shri Shankara Guruvaram&#8221; (Nagaswaravali) or Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Shobillu Saptaswara&#8221; (Jaganmohini) testified the above observations. Perfectly synchronising voices pausing at relevant places and above all, the apt speed were other positive features.Nevertheless, the improvisations had many shortcomings. Whereas, Harishnarayan was more at ease in the neraval sections, Shivaram was admirable in those of the swaraprastara. Alapanas in Simhendramadhyama (&#8220;Ninne Nammithinayya&#8221; - Vasudevacharya) or Todi (&#8220;Kaddanuvariki&#8221; - Tyagaraja) were not much inspiring, for want of substantial imagination and fluency.There were passing moments of inspiring expressions, as for instance while elaborating &#8220;Pannagendrashayana&#8221; (Ninne Nammithinayya) and &#8220;Padhuthappaga&#8221; (Kaddanuvariki). Other highlights were &#8220;Ekamresha Nayike&#8221; (Dikshitar) and &#8220;Saarasamukhi&#8221; (Goudmalhar - Muthaih Bhagavathar).The accompanists&#8217; reciprocations more or less tallied with the intensity of inspiration imparted by the lead artistes.***Abhishek Raghuram&#8217;s sprightly talent captured the audience, when he sang under the auspices of Nadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha, accompanied by Mysore Shrikanth (violin), Cheluvaraju (mridanga) and Shrishailam (ghata).His sense of shruthi was astounding and was amazingly fluent as well. The compositions he elaborated and the swaraprastara he executed  provided ample scope for the percussionists to demonstrate their might.Of the three ingredients &#8211; technique (first one), which is expected to transform a concert into a tuneful experience (second ingredient) which in turn is the precursor to a transcending musical aura (third requirement) - the first one overshadowed the other two.As the major portion of the recital comprised movements ranging from medium to fast tempos, a peaceful ambience was missing throughout. Consider either &#8220;Manasuloni&#8221; (Hindola-Tyagaraja) or &#8220;Ninne Nammithinayya&#8221; (Simhendramadhyama - Vasudevacharya). Hindola shone by its inherent grandeur and alapana by the violinist was more composed and melodic. It was disappointing that the lead artiste did not include any significant strains in slow articulations, either in the alapana or kalpanaswara sections.Simhendramadhyama in the taara sthayi was indeed not smooth. Instead of trying to establish his competence in high pitches, he could have advantageously exercised discretion in proving himself appealing in the madhya and the mandra sthayis. A neraval at &#8220;Nirajanethra&#8221; preceded vigorous swaraprastara.Raga Thana Pallavi (&#8220;Kamalavadane&#8221;) mainly in Nagaswaravali and Hamsadhwani could not establish anything concrete, except the fact that the artiste was capable of meeting any exigencies in matters of articulations and inflections.In tani avarthana, Cheluvaraju&#8217;s hard strokes drowned Shrishailam&#8217;s sober beats.V.
