VThe Saturday line up had Hindusthani concert by Jayateertha of Hubli and Chennai&#8217;s kuchipudi exponent Balatripura Sundari presenting an enthralling show. Jayateertha simply stole the show by his sheer speed with precision and clarity ofswaras. This Kirana gharana man presented two major ragas &#8211; &#8216;Marwa&#8217; in vilamba and Madhyalaya and &#8216;Shyam Kalyan&#8217; as achota  khyal. There was a bhajan too to top it up. Sridhar Mandre on tabla and Ustad Fayaz Khan on sarangi lent good support and revealed their scholarship intermittently. Chennai&#8217;s Balatripura Sundari&#8217;s kuchipudi solo was a treat to watch, more because of the touch of sophistication and more grammar induced into it. She is the disciple of Vempati Chinna Satyam. Very rarely you find a Tarangam describing Lord Siva, as they were originally kept Krishna as the centre of the theme. The very name of this work of Narayana Teertha isSrikrishna Leela Tarangini. Yet in this set you findSiva Siva Bhava Bhavaa rare piece and this gave dancer Bala to come out with Tandava and Lasya dance patterns, depicting the sequences ofGangavataranam, as one among theSiva Leelas.Omkaara Kariniin Revati and a Tillana in Behag, both of Balamuralikrishna were other impressive numbers she presented.The Sunday sessions opened in the morning with lecture demonstrations by Carnatic vocalist and musicologist Nookala Chinna Satyanarayana and Bharatanatyam exponent Rajeswari Sainath.Chennai&#8217;s most sought after vocalist Sanjay Subrahmanyam figured in the main concert in the evening who marked his recital withBhuvini Dasudaniin Srianjani, a rare &#8216;Kayaarochanesam bhajare&#8217; in Karnataka Devagandhari with raga essay,Swamiki Sari Yevvarein Devagandhari and then a Sama raga delineation forSantamuleka Soukhyamu Ledupreceded by its ragalapana. The Monday session had Tulasi Viswanath&#8217;s concert in the company of P. Nandakumar on violin, and his brother Jaya Bhasker on mridangam.
