VRadha Bhaskar of &#8216;Mudhra&#8217; presented &#8216;Saptharathnangal,&#8217; a thematic concert on Tyagaraja, Muthuswamy Dikshitar, Syama Sastry, Swati Tirunal, Papanasam Sivan, Gopalakrishna Bharathi and Koteeswara Iyer at Infosys Hall, Ramakrishna Mission Matric Higher Secondary School, Chennai. Seven vocalists, Radha Bhaskar, R. Suryaprakash, Sreyas Narayanan, Mohan Santhanam, Prarthana Sai Narasimhan, Vidya Kalyanaraman and Vasudha Ravi sang select compositions of these composers fully or in parts as required.Though the seven vocalists had come together on stage without any previous rehearsal the show was a great success that deserved and received a standing ovation. Radha Bhaskar&#8217;s connecting speech was packed with interesting and useful details about the composers. Tyagaraja has composed more than 700 kritis in 200 ragas, mostly in Telugu.The format of the kriti with a pallavi, anu pallavi and charanam blossomed in his hands. On the one hand he composed complicated structured sangatis as in &#8216;Chakkani Raja Maargamu&#8217; while on the other he produced very simple tunes as in the Utsava Sampradaya kirtanas. By composing 30 distinctly different kritis in Thodi, he has brought out the varied dimensions of the raga.Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s 1,000 kritis in Sanskrit bear witness to his high literary and musical excellence besides his mastery in various other fields such as architecture, iconography, manthra sastra and astrology. His &#8216;madhyama kaala sahithyams&#8217; and &#8216;samashti charanams (those following the pallavi without the anupallavi) are considered his greatest contributions to the kriti format.Dikshitar has composed thirty seven songs that resembled band music, all in Sankarabharanam and in Sanskrit, on various deities.Syama Sastry&#8217;s compositions are only seventy in number. But the depth of devotion and the beautiful raga movement  made him divine.  Unlike the other two, he has composed varnams and swarajatis. He gave swarajati a high pedestal  through his three monumental pieces in Thodi, Bhairavi and Yadukulakhambodi on Kamakshi.Swati Tirunal has composed krithis, bhajans and javalis in many languages and his compositions are rich in lyrical beauty. &#8216;Bhogeendra Shaayinam,&#8217; &#8216;Aaye Giridhar Dhwaare&#8217; and &#8216;Itu Saahasamu&#8217; were presented as samples.Papanasam Sivan has composed numerous kritis steeped in devotion, in rakthi ragas as well as rare ragas. He has composed ten kritis in Thodi bringing out the still unexplored dimensions of that raga. His compositions are unique in their structure and in the freedom they lend to the musicians for improvisation. &#8216;Kaa Vaa Vaa&#8217; in Varali was presented to demonstrate this point.Gopala Krishna Bharati has composed operas on Nandanar, Iyarpagaiyar, Karaikkal Ammaiyar and Thiruneelakantar. His &#8216;Ganaraaga Pancharatnam&#8217; in Nattai, Gowla, Arabhi, Varali and Sri are also famous. The participating musicians sang &#8216;Kanagasabhai Thirunadanam,&#8217; &#8216;Thandava Dharisanam&#8217; and &#8216;Aadum Cidambarame&#8217; as samples. Koteeswara Iyer&#8217;s compositions on all the 72 mela ragas can be considered his magnum opus. Through this work, he has given &#8216;swaroopa&#8217; (form) to most of the ragas which were just known as names earlier. In all these kritis, the raga mudra is embedded in a meaningful manner. His compositions &#8216;Velayyaa Dhayavillaiyaa&#8217; in Saveri and &#8216;Edhayyaa Gathi&#8217; in Chalanaattai brought the programme to a close.Kovai Chandran on the violin, Mudhra Bhaskar on the mridangam and H. Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam gave excellent support and shared the laurels.
