VSrividya Ramnath, accompanied by Dr. Natarajamurthy (violin), Adamya R. (mridanga) and Ravishankar R.P. (ghata), presented a vocal concert at the MES Kalavedi, Bangalore, last weekend.Beginning with the Begada varna in adi thala, the recital progressed with &#8220;Siddhivinayakam&#8221; in Shanmukhapriya raga and rupaka tala, embellished with a few kalpana swaras. Deekshithar's &#8220;Anandanatana Prakasham&#8221; in raga Kedara, which followed, was sung at a measured pace, emphasising not only the gravity of the structure and import of the composition, but also the prowess and dedication of the vocalist, and proved to be one of the most striking items of the concert. Kharaharapriya was thereafter taken up for a condensed elaboration that made a quick detour of the scale and was succeeded by &#8220;Senthil Andavan&#8221; in rupaka tala, augmented with a beautifully contoured neraval and fluent kalpana swaras.&#8220;Palukavemi&#8221;, the Thyagaraja composition in Poornachandrika raga and aditala was the bracing interlude before the main raga of the evening, Varali. The expansive alapana, drawing freely from impressive powers of improvisation, was studded with gamaka-laden phrases, stressing in particular the gandhara and madhyama, in consonance with the conventional and heavily classical character of the raga. Deekshithar's &#8220;Mamava Meenakshi&#8221; in mishra chapu thala, maintained an ideal kalapramana and was suffixed with a neraval at &#8220;Shyame Shankari&#8221; permeated with raga bhava and sahithya bhava, and kalpana swaras that included some spontaneous rhythmic patterns and a brief segment of diminishing cycles at the thara shadja. The concert concluded with a devaranama in Sindhubhairavi and &#8220;Kanakamaya Bhushana&#8221; in Ahir Bhairav.A vocal recital by Shankar Ramani, accompanied by Mathur Srinidhi (violin), Ranjani Venkatesh (mridanga) and Phaneendra Bhaskar (ghata) was hosted by the Maheswari Foundation recently. &#8220;Pahi Pahi Balaganapathe&#8221; in Hamsadhwani raga and rupaka tala, which followed the Sri raga varna, was preceded by a brief but mellifluous sketch of the raga and supplemented with kalpana swaras. While &#8216;Sarasaksha Paripalaya', the Swathi Thirunal krithi set to Panthuvarali raga and adi thala, featured an absorbing neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8216;Bhamini Samudashaya Mohana', the essence of Neelambari was highlighted in the magnificent Deekshithar composition &#8216;Amba Neelayathakshi' in adi thala.The artiste's exposition of Sreeranjani, imbued with a softness that was sustained in the faster briga oriented passages as well, included alluring phrases around the madhyama and dhaivatha, dwelling leisurely on the tara sthayi shadja, and on the madhya sthayi shadja during the final stages of the alapana. &#8220;Vetridala Maname&#8221; in adi tala was rounded off with some crisp kalpana swaras. The alapana of Kalyani, the main raga of the concert, incorporated numerous sancharas around the gandhara and panchama, with a significant stint around the plain nishada forming the crux of the exercise. Thyagaraja's &#8220;Nidhi Chala Sukhama&#8221; was presented in a mellow tempo and ornamented with a fairly comprehensive neraval at the anupallavi sahitya beginning &#8220;Dasharathi Dhyana&#8221;. Unfortunately, the kalpana swaras were completely omitted, presumably due to time constraints, and a fairly elaborate tani avarthana ensued. &#8220;Rama Manthrava&#8221; in Jaunpuri and &#8220;Nadupai&#8221; in Madhyamavathi were among the concluding items of the performance.
