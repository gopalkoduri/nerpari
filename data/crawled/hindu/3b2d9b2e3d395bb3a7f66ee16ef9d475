VSursagar had organised a morning Hindustani classical vocal concert of Shounak Abhisheki, the son of the legendary vocalist, the late Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki. Shounak Abhisheki demonstrated his prowess as a classicist par excellence with an enviabl\u000ae repertoire of rare, &#8216;anavat and aprachalit&#8217; ragas and impressed the audience with his in-depth knowledge of khayal gayaki. Although Shounak Abhisheki has absorbed the gayaki of several gharanas forging an individual style of his own, his affinity with the Jaipur style was distinctly discernible in his music.Shounak commenced his recital with a lesser known morning raga Shivamat Bhairav, a heptatonic melody  of the Bhairav family, sung around the time of sunrise. The prayerful bandish &#8220;Daare daare baat, tu hi samayo, tu hi banayo&#8221; in &#8216;sthayi&#8217; and &#8220;Sab phoolan ke tero hi gandh sugandh&#8221; in &#8216;antara&#8217; captured the invocatory fervour of this raga.Shounak&#8217;s expansive alaap in the rhythmic cycles of the vilambit khayal had all the alluring aesthetic aspects of his father&#8217;s gayaki. The raga with its difficult and unusual swara configurations would have posed a formidable challenge to any harmonium artiste, but Ravindra Katoti negotiated these convoluted twists and phrases with inimitable poise and dexterity. The measured pace with which Uday Raj Karpur followed the vocalist through the alaap, bol alaap and bol taans on the tabla enhanced the euphonious appeal of the raga.Shounak&#8217;s rendition of the drut teen tal composition in the same raga, &#8220;Aaj maujood bhayi, tab hi mitat andhera&#8221; in the faster tempo, revealed his impeccable mastery of &#8216;layakari&#8217; and &#8216;taankari&#8217;. With a tenacious and exemplary consistency, Shounak Abhisheki proved that he could sustain an entire concert with a fare of unheard  ragas. What followed  was another equally challenging raga Khat TodiIn his exposition of the bandish &#8220;Dhan dhan ri eiso preetam man base&#8221; in madhyalaya teental, Shounak captivated the audience with some unusual sargams.The young maestro presented the tarana in drut ektal, formidable for its rhythmic complexity with effortless ease.However, the piece de resistance of the concert was the rendition of the ragamalika by the vocalist. Yielding to the requests which came pouring in from the connoisseurs, Shounak presented yet another unusual, interesting Jaipur gharana bandish, &#8220;Koyaliya bolata&#8221; in madhyalaya in raga Hindol-Bahar and rendered a ragamalika as an accompanying piece in the drut laya . It was in his rendition of the ragamalika that one could unfailingly comprehend the musical genius and versatility of Shounak Abhisheki. Listening to the ragamalika which had an astonishing range of ragas was truly an enchanting experience. Shounak presented an incredible fare of nearly 17 ragas, kindling a sense of wonder and bewilderment in the audience.Shounak&#8217;s mellifluous and lyrical rendition of the Marathi abhang &#8220;Abir Gulal Udhalit Rang&#8221; mesmerised the audience. This composition of Sant Tukaram is immensely popular and has been rendered with extraordinary spiritual fervour by his late father. After the lyrical rhapsody of the abhang came the grand, sublime climax.Shounak Abhisheki concluded his recital with an immensely moving Hindi bhajan &#8220;Shiv ke man sharan ho, jab pran tan se nikle&#8221;.
