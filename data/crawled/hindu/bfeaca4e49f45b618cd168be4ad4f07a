VPRERANAParassala PonnammalSwathi Soft SolutionsPrice: Rs. 250.Parassala Ponnammal, vidushi who is well into her eighties,  has been recently creating waves in the Tamil Nadu concert circle. She is a disciple of stalwarts such as Harikesanallur Muthaiah Bagavathar and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. Ponnammal&#8217;s twin compact disc album  has the vocalist in the company of Lalgudi Vijayalaksmi (violin) and Nanjil Arul (mridangam).The selection includes songs that were popular a few decades back as well as a couple of rare compositions. &#8216;Dayapayonidhe&#8217; in Jaganmohini (Meesu Krishna Iyer) is the chosen number for a bright opening.The singer ensures that she reaches her destination perfectly every time the kakali nishadam is approached from the panchama note. That is reflective of her commitment towards swarasthana suddham. A brief alapana of Begada is satisfying. &#8216;Vande Deva,&#8217; one of the navavidha bhakti kritis of the royal composer Swati Tirunal, representing &#8216;Vandanam&#8217; is sung at a brisk pace followed by a few avarthas of solfa passages sung at the beginning of the charanam &#8216;Pavanasana.&#8217;&#8216;Bhavaye&#8217; in Sriranjani (Swati Tirunal) is a creation that is not frequently heard and is refreshing. A kriti in Mohanam (&#8216;Paripahi,&#8217; again by Swati Tirunal) follows suit. The major number in the first disc is the monumental &#8216;Maanasa Guruguha&#8217; of Muthuswamy Dikshitar in Anandabhairavi.Ponnammal&#8217;s vinyasa of the melody is a meaningful essay.  She does not overdo the alapana. The second disc opens with a rarely heard kriti of Muthaiah Bagavathar, &#8216;Manthrineem&#8217; in Hemavathi. The alapana, kriti, chittaswaram and the kalpanaswara passages are fair efforts. A painstaking alapana of Saveri (&#8216;Anjaneya,&#8217; composed by Swati Tirunal) is the main raga offered.Nanjil Arul&#8217;s mridangam accompaniment is very balanced throughout this recording. He matches the pace of the vocalist and his playing blends with the music of the singer. &#8216;Neeke Daya&#8217; (Neelambari, Tyagaraja) is a soulful rendering towards the close of this recording. A rather flat rendering of a Sindubhairavi song (Athatha Dani) and a Saurashtram number (&#8216;Sarasijanaba&#8217;) are the other Swati Tirunal compositions vocalised. The vishranti, poise and calm which can be experienced while listening to D.K. Pattammal can also be savoured in the music of Ponnammal.
