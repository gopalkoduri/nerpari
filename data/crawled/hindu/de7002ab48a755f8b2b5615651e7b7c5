VThe five-day mega event which saw a marathon 108-hour rendition of Annamacharya keertanas round the clock by nearly 5,000 singers from all over the state reached a fitting climax. The stupendous music fete took place at Kshetrayya Kala Kshetram, Vijayawada, organised by Silicon Andhra of California represented by Kuchibhotla Anand, founder president of Silicon Andhra with the cooperation of T.T.D devasthanam and A.P. Department of Culture. The memorable event went without any hitch and found place in the coveted Guinness Book of World Records, represented by Amanda Moken of New York. The colourfully-dressed teams each consisting of 36 singers rendered 1008 Annamayya keertanas without repetition, to the delight of the packed crowd.A large number of lesser known keertanas also found place in the renditions. A part of the event was Govinda Namarchana held on the banks of Krishna river, attended by large number of devotees. Amanda Moken was all praise for the colourful event and the culture of the people of Andhra. She stated that this was the third time that Silicon Andhra's activity was recorded in the Guinness Book, first being the marathon Kuchipudi group dance held in California and the second being the Lakshagala Sankeertanarchana held in Hyderabad last year.The valedictory session was presided over by former minister Madali Budha Prasad. Speaking as the chief guest, Chakrapani, chairman of A.P. Legislative Council hoped that this achievement has once again showcased the cultural heritage of Andhra people to the world.
