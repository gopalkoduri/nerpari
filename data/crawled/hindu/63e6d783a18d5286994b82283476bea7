VThe first day witnessed &#8216;Nada Laya Pravah,&#8217; an instrumental ensemble conceptualised and directed by  mridangam artiste Trichur R. Mohan.The ensemble comprised violin, mridangam, ganjira, ghatom, morsing, tavil and percussion instruments from Kerala such as maddalam, timila and edakka. Divided into three sections, the two-hour performance started off  with an elaboration of  Hamsadwani, which was initiated by the violins and  taken up by the nagaswaram. The melody was embellished by the percussion. The crescendo had the percussion instruments from Kerala enhancing the beats of the recital. Ragas Revagupti, Mohana Kalyani and Ranjini were taken in a ragamalika.The second half of the concert was  devoted to Revathy, which created an ambience of devotion. Kaapi was explored in the final half, which  also featured Behag, Sivaranjini, Madhuvanthi, Neelambarai, Parpathi and Sindhubhairavi. The artistes were Trichur Mohan (mridangam), Bangalore Kothandaraman (nagaswaram), Edappilly Ajithkumar and Manjur Sreejith (violins), Y. N. Santha Ram (ganjira), Gopinatha Prabhu (ghatom), Payyannur Govinda Prasad (morsing), Vijayakumar (tavil), Eravathu Appu Marar (maddalam), Eravathu Ravi Marar (timila) and Peethambara Marar (edakka).On the second day, U.P. Raju entertained the audience with a three-hour concert that highlighted his mastery over the mandolin. &#8216;Khanta jathi&#8217; in Ada tala varnam in Kamboji was the opening number. Soon, Hamsadwani followed with a short alapana. He filled in the gaps by sliding on to the bass strings, which enhanced the  aesthetic appeal of the piece. Mallari in Gambhira Natta and &#8216;Khanta jathi tripuda&#8217; were a welcome change.His essaying of the pentatonic scale of  Mohanam was remarkable.  T.H. Subramaniam&#8217;s avarthanam for this number is sure to linger in the ears of the rasikas for long. The concert, as a whole, was percussion-oriented with B.Harikumar on the mridangam, Payyannur Govinda Prasad on the morsing and Vellattanjur Sreejith on the ghatom.Vocalist V. R. Dileepkumar presented a scintillating recital to mark the finale. He was accompanied by T. V. Ramanjujacharyalu (violin), B. Harikumar (mridangam) and S. Karthick (ghatom).  A penchant for rare ragas was evident as his first choices included &#8216;Chalamelara&#8217; in Duarbar,  &#8216;Ramabhirama&#8217; in Dhanyasi,  and &#8216;Sadasamavanirupa&#8217; in Saraswathy.  &#8216;Sukha sukha mridangam tala,&#8217; the Tyagaraja composition in Sreeranjini, was a welcome change. The light number &#8216;Eppovaruvaro&#8217; in Jonpuri was full of verve. Udupi S. Srikanth provided support on ganjira.The programme was a maiden venture of Agni Cultural Academy, Annamanada, Thrissur district.
