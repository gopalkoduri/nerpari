VMathur Srinidhi, accompanied by Prashanth (mridanga) and Karthik (khanjira) presented a solo violin recital recently as part of a series organised by the Malleswaram Arya Vysya Sangha, Bangalore.The concert got off to an invigorating start with a two speed rendition of &#8220;Chalamela&#8221;, the adi thala varna in Nattakurinji. The Muthuswami Deekshithar composition &#8220;Mahaganapathim Manasa Smarami&#8221; in Natta was next, presented in a bracing tempo and adorned with a few kalpana swaras. Bilahari was then taken up for a brief alapana replete with briga-oriented sancharas punctuated with fine touches, emphasizing its dynamic vitality rather than its more mellow aspects, followed by &#8220;Sri Chamundeswari&#8221; in adi tala.A short sketch of Huseni and the Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Rama Ninne&#8221; in adi tala preceded a succinct alapana of Madhyamavathi. &#8220;Nadupai&#8221;, set to khanda chapu thala, was supplemented with several rounds of kalpana swaras that included some rhythmic patterns and a final focus on the panchama. A swift &#8220;Pariyachakama&#8221; in Vanaspathi raga and an even faster &#8220;Bantureethi&#8221; in Hamsanadam, led to the main raga of the evening, Karaharapriya.The compact alapana included attractive sancharas around the madhyama and some forceful phrases around the panchama, while the melodious facets of the raga were revealed in the tara sthayi. &#8220;Rama Neeyeda&#8221; in adi tala was followed by kalpana swaras, with just a glimpse of the first speed and a modicum of swaras in the second, ably supported by the accompanists. The concert ended with the ragamalika &#8220;Baro Krishnayya&#8221;.While the performance was a reiteration of the artiste's proven technical and improvisational prowess, speed seemed to be the leitmotif of all the items included. A more relaxed approach, and a greater stress on the gentler and more soothing aspects some of the ragas and compositions within the allotted time frame, would have enhanced the overall impact considerably.
