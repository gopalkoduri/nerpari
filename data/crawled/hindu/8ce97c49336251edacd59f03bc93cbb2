VThe Pollachi Tamizhisai Sangam celebrated the Thooran centenary in a heart-warming manner at Mahatma Gandhi Mandapam, Pollachi. N. Mahalingam presided over the centenary celebrations that included the screening of a short film on Thooran, release of \u000ahis books , felicitations by dignitaries and a vocal recital by Bombay Sisters, C. Saroja and C. Lalitha. Born in 1908, in a middle class agricultural family at Manjakkattu valasu, a village near Erode, M.P.Periasamy Thooran had to struggle hard to reach the altitude he achieved. When T.S.Avinashilingam, the great patriot from Coimbatore, started Sri Ramakrishna Vidyalayam, he invited Thooran to work there as a teacher and warden. Later, Thooran rose to be its headmaster and served in that position for many years.The years  he spent at Sri Ramakrishna Vidyalayam were quite fruitful in his literary career. He composed many poems in Tamil during this period which were later set to tune by the music teacher of that school and other popular musicians. His songs have been widely acclaimed for their simplicity, lyrical beauty and depth of devotion.The stalwarts of yesteryear and top-ranking artists of today have been singing many of his compositions in concerts. &#8216;Konji Konji Vaa Guhane&#8217; in Khamas, &#8216;Muruga Muruga Endraal&#8217; in Saveri, &#8216;Thaye Tripura Sundari&#8217; in Sudha Saveri and &#8216;Muraleedharaa Gopala&#8217; in Maund, are some of the evergreen favourites.His greatest contribution to Tamil, however, is the compilation of ten volumes of the Encyclopaedia in Tamil. After completing this mammoth task successfully he compiled another ten volumes of Children&#8217;s encyclopaedia in Tamil. Besides volumes of stories and songs for children, he has written books  on psychology and embryology. An avid lover of Bharathiar, he took great pains to collect all the unpublished works of Bharathiar and got them published in the name &#8216;Bharathi Tamizh.&#8217; He tried his hand successfully in translating famous stories into Tamil from English. His list of achievements is long and varied.  Veteran vocalists, C.Saroja and C. Lalitha,  who have a career of concert singing spanning many decades presented a vocal concert consisting of Thooran&#8217;s compositions. They started with the varnam in Madhyamavati and followed it with &#8216;Gananaathane&#8217; in Saranga, &#8216;Thaye Tripurasundari&#8217; in Sudha Saveri and &#8216;Harihara Suthane Aiyappaa&#8217; in Abhogi. They sang &#8216;Kundruruva Velvaangi Ninra Guruparane&#8217; in Kalyani after a wholesome delineation of the raga. &#8216;Veledutha Kaiye Nam Vinai Theerkkum Meyye&#8217; in Thodi was the central piece. &#8216;Kaalakaalan Kayilai Naathan&#8217; in Atana and &#8216;Engu Naan Selvenayyaa&#8217; in Dwijavanti were sung with emotion. The neraval for the lines &#8216;Enthai Nee Enthanai Igazhnthidil Naan Engadaiven&#8217; (Kalyani) was particularly moving.Thooran&#8217;s use of imagery adds sparkle to the already beautiful compositions. The phrase, &#8216;Thingal Ven Pinjinai Senjadai Thaangidum&#8217; (Engu Naan Selvenayyaa) is just an example. Very few poets would have thought of describing the crescent moon as &#8216;Thingal Ven Pinju&#8217;. The concluding song &#8216;Kaanbathengo Inimel Gandhiyaippol Oru Shaantha Mahaatmaavai&#8217; was most appropriate as the venue was Mahatma Gandhi Mandapam. The portraits of Gandhi covering the walls of the mandapam bore evidence to the truth in Thooran&#8217;s words. Kovai Balasubramaniam&#8217;s mellifluous violin, K.R. Suresh&#8217;s mridangam and Kovai G. Suresh&#8217;s ghatam enhanced the vocal recital to a great extent.
