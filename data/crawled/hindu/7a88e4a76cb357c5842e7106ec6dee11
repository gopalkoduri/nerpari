VNada Bharathi featured an exclusive music discourse on Syama Sastri and his works as part of its ongoing weekly concert series. This musical demonstration came as a welcome change from the routine concerts and was ably presented by R.V. Panduranga Sharma a disciple of Puranam Purushottama Sastry and D.K. Pattammal. Sharma was supported by Rajan on the violin.Sharma focused on some of his important compositions and his works. Syama Sastri  was not only a greatvaggeyakarabut also a musical genius. He composed swarajhathis, varnams, krithis which were highly technical and timeless. One needs to be really knowledgeable to understand and learn these compositions. Certain ragams are his creations likeDevi brovain chintamani,Brovavamma tamasain Manji. Sharma went on to sing the Navaratna malika compositions. Syama Sastri had written nine gems on Meenakshi amman. Out of these nine, only seven are available presently.Saroja dalanetriandDevi meena netriin Sankarabharanam,Marivere gathiin Ananda Bhairavi,Nannu brova lalithein Lalithe,Mayyammain Aheri,Devi neepaadain Khambhoji andMeena Lohanain Dhanyasi were elegantly rendered by Sharma .His Swara jhathis have a special place in the music world. In this raga bhavam and sahitya go with each other with ecstatic meaning and rich music. The Thodi swarajhathiRave himagiri,Kamakshiin Bhairavi andKamakshi nee padayugamin Yadukula Khambhoji were neatly sung by Sharma during this context.Syama Sastri had rich knowledge in Sanskrit, Telugu and Tamil and the Vishesha pada prayogas reflect his crafty compositions. He had written about nearly 300 compositions and only few are in fashion . Sharma also highlighted some of the key incidents of Syama Sastri&#8217;s life such as winning over Bobbili Kesavaiyer, a great Vidwan during his times, in a tough competition with each other. He also created a highly compex talam called Sharabha Nandini talam with 19 three by fourth kriyas to beat Kesava Iyer in that competition.Panduranga Sharma&#8217;s complete presentation of Syama Sastri&#8217;s life was very educative as well as informative and was largely appreciated by the rasikas.
