VNegotiating the fluid graces of Karur Devudu Iyer&#8217;s varnam, &#8216;Sami Ninnekori&#8217; in  raga Sri with ease, the artiste moved on to Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Swaminatha Paripalayasumam&#8217; (Nattai), in which the surprise package came in the form of the choice of eduppu for the melkala kalpanaswaras, at &#8216;Paripalaya&#8217;, 13 aksharas after the samam. Effective poruttams complemented the effort.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Ksheerasagara Sayana&#8217; (Devagandhari) with the encompassing sweep of its sangatis illustrating the perfect synergy of lyric and melody exalted by bhakti, swayed the listener, as always, while a robust &#8216;Chinna Nadena&#8217; (Kalanidhi) provided change in mood and pace.The Lathangi alapana did not tarry over long in any one suite, the effort being evenly distributed instead, over the madhyama kala raga scape. Patnam Subramania Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;Marivere&#8217; heralded a well-knit niraval-swara segment at &#8216;Dharalona&#8217; with kanakkus that fell neatly into place. The strategic placement of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Seethamma Mayamma&#8217; (Vasantha) ensured a relaxed air at this juncture.In the main raga Bhairavi, full-bodied prayogas bolstered by pidis placed emphasis on essentials.There was a smooth flow and familiar ease to the sancharas that spoke of time and thought devoted to the structuring of the alapana.The leisurely exposition of the Pallavi Sesha Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;&#8217;Ikanannu Brovakunna,&#8217; a kriti that deserves to be aired more often, was borne forward by the kizhkala kalpanaswaras that explored the niceties of raga swarupa.Tiruvallur Parthasarathy (violin) offered cohesive alapanas of Lathangi and Bhairavi.A.V. Manikandan (mridangam) wove rhythmic patterns that combined strength with subtlety.
