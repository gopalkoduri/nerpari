VG. JAYAKUMARSoorya's Parampara section in which disciples pay obeisance to gurus began last week at Gorky Bhavan with a vocal concert by Dhanya, a final-year engineering student and disciple of Mamangalam M.R. Madhusoodana Menon.She began with a varnam `Vanajakshi' in `Kalyani' set to adi talam. This was followed by a kriti `Karimugha' varada in `Natta.'  The main composition was `Meenakshi memadham' in `Poorvikalyani,' in which the raga was well delineated. The other compositions included `Paramakripa' in `Yadukula kambhoji', `Kanyha thava pizhain' in `Atana' and a tillana in `Brindavani'.Dhanya was accompanied by Chertala R. Jayadev on the mridangam, Attukal Balasubramaniam on the violin and Aadhichanellur Anilkumar on the ghatom.Imaginative alterationsThe next day's concert by B. Arundhathi, a disciple of Omanakutty, was marked by imaginative alterations in singing. The main feature of the concert was the rendering of `Thamarame' in `Thodi' wherein the vocalist was at her best with ragaalapana,swarapassages andmanodharmasangeetham. Set to adi talam, the kriti was followed by thaniavarthanam with Babu on the mridangam, Aadhichenellur Anilkumar handling the ghatam and Payyannur Govinda Prasad on the the morsing. Vrinda Varma accompanied on the violin.Arundhathi's recital began with a varnam in Saveri and continued with `Shree Ganapathe' in Abhogi set to khandachappu talam. Next was a kriti in `Natta Ninne bhajana.' Then came `Ramachandra bhavayami' in `Vasantha' set to rupaka talam. With a brief raga alapanam, Arundhathi rendered `Teli ninneru' in `Kalyani' in her mellifluous voice. `Vidacha', a composition in `Janaranjini' was briskly rendered.The concluding pieces included `Aliveni' (Kurinji),'Jagado udharana', (Kaapi) and a `Lalgudi' tillana in `Maand.'Teacher and singerOn the third day, listeners were treated to a vocal concert by K.S. Reshmi, another disciple of Omanakutty.A lecturer at the Department of Music, University of Madras, Reshmi began her concert with an invocation to Lord Ganesha, and followed it with `Deva deva kalayamithe' in `Mayamalavagoula' set to rupaka talam.The highlight of the concert was `Sivananda kamapathiye' in `Pantuvarali' set to chappu talam. Thaniavarthanam was single-handedly performed on the mridangam by Elanjimel Susheelkumar. Some of the other compositions rendered included `Nannu brova nee' in `Abhogi,' `Vadaneeswaram bhajeham' (Devagandhari), `Bhogeendrasayinam' (Kundalavarali),  and a tillana in Bhupalam. Attukal Balasubramaniam on the violin did a commendable job.The tamburu, once a permanent fixture in concerts, seems to be on its way out. All  three concerts saw thesruthi pettitaking the place of the tamburu.Bottom Template Starts
