VThe artiste launched a well-defined Kharaharapriya alapana with a comprehensive middle octave-spanning sweep. Akara was used often and confidently especially at the development around the dhaivatham, the voice taking on an added sheen.Brigas issuing from the tara sthayi shadja added tautness to structure. The point at which the concert gathered momentum was the shadja-centric kizhkala niraval that morphed into the second speed at &#8216;Paluku Paluku&#8217; in &#8216;Samanamevaru.&#8217; Simhendramadyamam buzzed with medium-fast sancharas around the panchama and tara-sthayi shadja, the indication of a plaintive prathi madhyam throwing up an interesting textural contrast in the initial phase. The violinist&#8217;s version was a tad hurried, leaving him little opportunity to dwell on niceties. &#8216;Needhu Charanamule&#8217; held attention even without niraval-swaras props.&#8216;Phanipathi Saayi&#8217; (Jhankaradhwani) a rarely aired, haunting composition, came as a pleasant surprise. The vocalist&#8217;s exposition of the main raga, Begada, was strengthened by sancharas driven by purpose and direction.That the raga was much more than an acquaintance but not yet a trusted confidant was hinted at by a trace of caution here, a touch of reserve there.&#8216;Nadopasana&#8217; carried forward the succinct introduction with assertive sangathis reinforced by the kalpanaswara segment encompassing half avartana kuraippu swaras centred at the gandhara.An appreciable aspect of Swarna Rethas&#8217;s singing was his open-throated projection of voice and frequent use of akara that lent weight to prayogas. However, if the vocalist wishes to view kritis as something beyond a series of sangathis strung together, he must focus on accuracy in sahitya as well as sahitya/artha bhava.Apt tonal modulation would be a welcome add-on, contributing towards sensitive interpretation.S. Karthick (violin) whose Begada was couched in the language of familiarity handled both form and filigree with ease.His Kharaharapriya coasted on impulse, drawing flavour at random points. Nirmal Narayan (mridangam) was competent, although his embellishment of sangathis required more subtlety than the flurry of sollus that surfaced at certain points.
