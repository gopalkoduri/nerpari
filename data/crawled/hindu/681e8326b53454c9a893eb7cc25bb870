VTHERE IS a constant complaint that people's tastes have changed and there is no respect for our culture. Those who had the good fortune to attend the Pongal music festival organised by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Coimbatore, would think differently. The vast pandal was fully packed for all concerts, and during Sudha Raghunathan's concert, it overflowed.N. Vijaya Siva, a student of late, D. K. Jayaraman, sent the audience into raptures with his pure traditional music. He gave what was expected generously, but without exceeding the limit. Commmencing with Adi Shankara's Ganesha Pancharatnam, he moved on to `Thulaseedalamula' in Mayamalava Gowla by Tyagaraja. Most of the songs sung by him had been popularised by M. S. Subbulakshmi.His elaborate alapanas of Bilahari and Todi for the songs `Kamakshi Srivaralakshmi' and `Karthikeya Gangeya' respectively were captivating.With an appropriate Thillana and Thiruppugazh, N. Vijay Siva paid his soulful tribute to M. S. Subbulakshmi and gratified the audience. R. K. Sriram Kumar on the violin displayed amazing mastery and J. Vaidyanathan earned hearty applause from the audience along with B. S. Purushothaman who wielded the kanjira.Rich fareSudha Raghunathan's concert was specially designed as a tribute to the late queen of music. She seemed to have an uncanny ability to assess the expectation of the audience. Without devoting much time to the elaboration of the ragas, she presented a rich fare, each song being a brilliant gem. The first half included the Bhairavi varnam, `Viriboni,' `Sri Ganapahini' in Sowrashtram, and `Arul Purivay Karunaikkadale.' `When the artistes were requested to speak on their association with M. S., Sudha Raghunathan gave an emotional speech. Quoting the slokha `Na Karmana Na Prajaya', R. K. Sriram Kumar reminded the audience that only through sacrifice could immortality be attained and declared that M. S.  has achieved that state through her generosity and sacrifice.K.V. Prasad, who had accompanied her during most of her performances, including the last one, broke down when he was recalling her absolute trust in him and her incredible ability to sing differently on each occasion. Sudha restored normalcy with the spirited `Amba, Nee Irangayenil' in Atana.Then there was a cascade of favourites such as `Bhavayami Raghuramam', `Akhilandeshwari,', `Bantureethikolu,' `O Rangasayee,' `Jagadodharana,' `Katriniley Varum Geetham,' `Pyare Darsan Deejo Aaj' (Meera Bhajan), `Kurai Onrum Illai' and finally `Maithrim Bhajatha.'R. K. Sriram Kumar on the violin proved his mettle that day also as he did the previous day. K. V. Prasad, who played mridangam for her after a gap of 20  years, and R. Raman on the morsing who usually accompanies her, played with gusto.MajesticIn his concert, T. M. Krishna rode in majesty with absolute confidence. After `Neranammi,' a varnam in Kanada, he presented `Sooryamoorthe,' in Sowrashtram, propitiating the Sun God, it being a Sunday. `Bhogeendra Shayinam' in Kuntalavarali by Swathi Tirunal, was sung in a regal style, giving emphasis to each word, bringing out the beauty of the sahitya.Following a pleasing Nattakkurinji he sang `Ekkaalaththilum Maravene', a devout song by Ramaswami Sivan. `Nenarunchi nanu' followed at supersonic speed. Then there was the lilting alapana of Kedaram and Dikshitar's `Ananda Natana Prakasam.' `Saraguna Palimpa' in Kedaragowla, being the main piece, was presented masterfully, but became a little too lengthy.Percussionists Poongulam Subramaniam on the mridangam and B. S. Purushothaman on the kanjira surpassed themselves during the tani avarthanam winning a thunderous applause.Mullaivasal Chandramouli's violin was mellifluous, and contributed effectively to the total impact of Krishna's music.Bottom Template Starts
