VAs part of Thyagaraja's 244th&#160;Jayanthi celebrations, Potti Sreeramulu Telugu University featured noted veena artiste Ayyagari Shyamasunder in a concert held at university's auditorium.Shyamasundar was in demonstrative mood&#160;and added a few casual observations even before opening with Apparama Bhakti in Pantuvarali in Roopakam.&#160;He said music was intended for rakti, which was surprisingly missing from his concert.&#160;&#160;He had tabla support along with mridangam and said that they were like (representative of) two eyes of Indian music &#8212; Carnatic and Hindustani.He spent more time at the vilamba part of raga expansion but finally gave a good picture of raga. Aparama Bhakti was played with high and low musical note with uneven melodic output.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Shyamsunder then introduced Raga Dhenuka, a folk melody akin to snake charming Nagaswaravali. He played Teliyaleru Rama in this. Dhenuka raga presentation was even. He also tried at some virtuosi skills like rubbing on the side strings to give out better or varied sounds while playing the raga. He played Hindolam (Neerajakshi Kamakshi) in response to a request from a telephone call that he received from a music lover. He went for the raga but only to give a sketch of it and not a sumptuous play. The composition was well presented with impressive swarakalpana.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sankarabharanam was the main raga, Shyamsundar chose for the occasion and gave good time for its expansion and sumptuous feel of raga. His imagination was at play.&#160;&#160;Though there was a touch of tanam in all the numbers, but what he presented in this raga Sankarabharanam was a satisfying exercise. Buddhiraadu of Thyagaraja stood out as the best piece. Swaraprasthara too was explored in detail adding a bit of his imagination&#160;and instrumental virtuosity.&#160;Kapa Srinivasa Rao on mridangam and Gunaranjan on tabla lent support. &#160;
