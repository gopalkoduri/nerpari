Chandanabala Kalyan from Mumbai at Kalabharathi last Saturday. Ch. Sanyasi Rao of Vizianagaram on violin, local artiste G. Venkata Rao on mridangam and B. Maruthi Raghuram from Rajahmundry on ghatam ably lent support.Expansive expatiation ofMarivere(Lathaangi-Khandachaapu),Raagam ThaanamandPallavi(Jagadekapathe Paarthasaradhe) inKambhoji-Aaditaalamwere the highlights of her performance that evening.Despite the attribute of becoming suddenly brittle, she made good use of her otherwise pleasingly sharp voice. Minor deviations like neglect of choosing of appropriate phraseology with a combination of thePoorvanga Swaras (Kalyani) and theUttaranga Swaras (Mayamaalavagoula)of theMoorchanaofLathanginotwithstanding, she brought out a convincing picture of the 63rdMelakartha Raagamin heraalapana.She evocatively sang thekrithiin it and concluded it with invigoratingneravuandswaramin the two speeds. TheThanamandPallaviafter elaborateaalapanaofKambhojireplete with sensibleprayogaswere erudite exercises.
