Subbalakshmi in the company of S.V.Ramana Murthy on violin and Burra Sriram on mridangam. The programme was held at the Sabha's venue.Subbalakshmi belongs to a musical family. She is the daughter of Bandi Shyamala, a senior veena virtuoso under whose tutelage Subbalakshmi learned music and later from Nookala Chinna Satyanarayana and Kokkonda Subramanya Sarma. Manda Sudharani is now guiding her. A postgraduate in music from Telugu University with a  diploma of Sangeetha Alankara from Maharashtra Mandal, she  is graded artiste of All India Radio.Hasty startWinner of several awards, she has given numerous recitals in the state.  Andhra Music Academy provided her platform to perform.  In this concert she appeared to be a bit hasty. Literally she ran through the first four or fivekirtanas. She rendered them with undue haste. But settled down only by the time she reached her choiceraga Thodi, which she expanded with care. She observed discipline in building thisragawith vast scope. Her choice in thisragawasNinne Namminanuof Shyama Sastry inMisrachapu Taala.Theswarakalpanashe presented was imaginative. The repertoire for the evening was a good mix of compositions of great saints. They were two of Thyagaraja and two of Deekshitar. All the four were choice numbers, which were hurried through, except theTodipiece of Shyama Sastry. But she rendered them withSahityaclarity.Lakshmi began withVasantha varnam Ninnu Korian exercising one. This was followed by a popular invocation  -VatapiinHamsadhwani.Mara VyriinNasika BhushaniandTelisi RamachintanatoinPoornachandrika- both Tyagaraja compositions were satisfying. But the main piece wasRagam-Tanam-PallaviinMohana. Subbalakshmi delineated theragawith care and confidence.TheTanampart was quite brisk and engaging. And thePallaviopened withRendakharala Jaaga, inKhanda Jati Triputa.Pahimam Parvati Parameswari, Sankari, Sundari, Gowriwas thePallavishe composed for this exercise. This was most satisfying piece.The last number was of Papanasam Sivan's inHamsanandi - Srinivasa Tiruvenkata. This was preceded byslokasrendered in aragachain. Thekritiwas  pure devotional. TheTaniby Burra was quite engaging while Ramanamurthy's violin support was laudable.Bottom Template Starts
