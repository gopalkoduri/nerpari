VNew challenges await us, as each day dawns.  This has made it  imperative for  institutes to train the youth to stand  apart in this age of cut-throat competition.Aria - The Music School in West Delhi has been successful in spreading its wings within a short span of two years. The school,  brainchild of Hitesh &#8216;Rikki&#8217; Madan (lead guitarist of the band Euphoria), Payal Sharma Madan and Ashwani Verma, was started in May 2005 to provide professional coaching in  several performing arts under one roof.The students of this music school recently put up an entertaining annual concert  at the Shri Ram Centre auditorium in the Capital. The event was spread over two days. The highlight of the festival was the musical  &#8220;Mnjini&#8221;. Based on a story written by the late Rita Dutta Gupta, it was directed by Payal.  The music was by Hitesh.&#8220;Producing and staging a musical has been a dream come true. Blessed were we to have had the resources and complete freedom to do it just the way we liked,&#8221; shared Hitesh.He adds, &#8220;With the number of participants doubled this year, we have certainly come a long way since our humble beginning at India Habitat Centre last year.&#8221; Earlier during the event, amateur student bands  performed popular numbers like Metallica&#8217;s &#8220;Nothing Else Matters&#8221;, &#8220;Smells Like Teen Spirit&#8221; by Nirvana and John Lennon&#8217;s &#8220;Classic Imagine&#8221;. The faculty  along with Hitesh wowed the audience, performing songs like  &#8220;Mony Mony&#8221;. DJ Bhaduri, band member of Euphoria, joined  the gang  for the song &#8220;Rab Jaane&#8221;, which Hitesh composed for Euphoria&#8217;s latest album, Mehfuz.&#8220;The performances of these students were simply marvellous and to see budding musicians put so much effort into the show is satisfying as a professional,&#8221; said Bhaduri.MANUSHRESHTH SHARMABottom Template Starts
