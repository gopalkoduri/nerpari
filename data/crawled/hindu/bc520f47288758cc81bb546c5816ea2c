VRecipient of the prestigious &#8216;Man of theYear&#8217; Award in 2001 from ABI for achievement and dedication towards exemplary goals and also recipient of the national award from the then Vice-President Krishan Kant carrying a citation and a cash \u000aaward  is no mean achievement for Suchit Narang who has fought his infirmity boldly and met high standards in Hindustani music.His visually challenged condition has hardly been an impediment and it is really amazing that in his repertoire and rendition, he could be compared with any front ranking artiste in the country.Visiting Chennai with a mission to speak and instruct on the use of Brail for Carnatic musicians, he also presented a concert. Belonging to the Kirana Gharana of Ghazi Khan and Kale Khan fame, Suchit who is now  under the tutelage of Vidhushi Mattoo,  presented his gurubhai Taresh Sharma the delineation of raga Puriya Dhanashree in ek taal madhya laya, &#8216;Shankar Shiv Mahadev.&#8217;Suchit began his recital in raga Miyan ki Malhar &#8216;Kari main kaise&#8217; in ek taal vilambit, slowly improvising in his deep guttural voice employing the &#8216;been ang gayaki&#8217; of Ustad Bande Ali Khan taking the swaras in &#8216;kharaj&#8217; so well, delineating each swara distinctively providing tonal variations showcasing a highly cultured voice. The dhrut piece, &#8216;umard gumard ghanwa chamkat,&#8217; was accompanied by a characteristic throw in the voice taking sargams with a great finish. On request Suchit sang the Multani &#8216;Sundar surjhanuma saaniee&#8217; followed by a short bandish in  Kedar.    Munish on the tabla and Viresh Madri on the violin provided excellent support.
