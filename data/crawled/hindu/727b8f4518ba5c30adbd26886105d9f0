VKalasagaram featured K. Shyam Kumar, an up and coming  vocalist from Hyderabad recently. Shyam Kumar is also a noted kanjeera and mridangam player. His strength is his laya, and histara sthairendition is more prominent than his lower octaves. Shyam began his recital withSarasuda, a Saveri varnam and went on to singSwaminathain Nattai. Manoranjani, taken for Thyagaraja&#8217;sAtukaradhani Balka, started bit shakily but later he quickly adjusted and did well.Saraseeruha Nayanewas the krithi and the neraval atVaradayanee amritha varshiniwas good with briskswaram.Idi Nyaama Sree Ramachandrain Maalavi was a fast number performed ably.The main attraction was the elaboration of Varali and Shyam tried his best to decorate the raga. The only missing element of the concert was a main Ghana raga.The concert concluded with a Surdas bhajanGopi Gopala Balain Gamanasrama. Shyam has the potential and can improve his voice modulation and aesthetics of the ragam. Shyam was accompanied by R. Dinakar on the violin and D.S.R. Murty on the mridangam, who all contributed to a good team effort.
