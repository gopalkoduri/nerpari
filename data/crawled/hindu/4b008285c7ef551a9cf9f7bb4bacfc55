VVocalists R.K. Srikantan and his son Ramakanth, who have worked assiduously to popularise devaranamas through their books and concerts, find the renewed interest in Haridasa compositions heartening. However, they regret that in many cases, devaranamas are not being taught or rendered in keeping with the traditions.What are those norms or traditions? The father-son duo believe, that firstly, these devaranamas should be rendered only in 32 designated ragas as used by Purandaradasa (see box). It pains them to hear musicians deviating from these 32 and using ragas like Revathi, Shivaranjani, Kalyanavasanta, etc., and even Hindustani ragas. In fact, Hindustani ragas are a complete no-no, especially for Purandaradasa&#8217;s lyrics, as he composed in Carnatic ragas alone, they explain. Moreover, some audiences &#8211; thanks to their own ignorance &#8211; not only accept these deviations but even applaud the musicians, further reinforcing this trend, regrets Ramakanth.I point out that many musicians have chosen ragas outside these 32, believing that the devaranamas sounds just as beautiful &#8211; if not more &#8211; in those ragas. In fact, some of the most popular devaranamas use other ragas eg. &#8220;Venkatachala Nilayam&#8221; in Sindhubhairavi, &#8220;Jagadodharane&#8221; in Kapi, &#8220;Krishna Nee Begane&#8221; in Yamunakalyani, etc.Ramakanth concedes that devaranamas indeed have an appeal even in other ragas but says such renditions would not be strictly in keeping with tradition.  Every composition has a certain meaning, mood and tempo. Every raga has a characteristic rasa and laya. So, only a certain raga may be employed for a particular lyric. Thus, there was a rationale underlying the Haridasa&#8217;s raga-choices. Therefore, rendering the devaranama in that same raga is ideal for unravelling its entire potential and inherent beauty.For the same reason, Ramakanth and Srikantan caution against learning devaranamas from records. &#8220;If the musician has chosen unsuitable ragas or adopted inappropriate rendition style, students end up imbibing those mistakes and propagating the same when they turn performers. Devaranamas must be learnt only from teachers well-versed in Haridasa conventions.&#8221;What&#8217;s the &#8220;inappropriate rendition style&#8221; he refers to, I ask. Ramakanth says one sign is overindulgence in manodharma. One should observe brevity in manodharma for devaramanas. Being light-classical compositions, devaramanas can&#8217;t take the weight of heavy, prolonged alapana. So, render limited ragaalapana followed by optimum quantity of swarakalpana. Ideally, neraval should be totally avoided. Perhaps a few devaranamas can take limited neraval (and swarakalpana) like, for eg. &#8220;Manavajanma&#8221; (Purvikalyani), &#8220;Nambikettavarillavo&#8221; and &#8220;Kallusakkare&#8221; (both Kalyani), or &#8220;Pogadirelo Ranga&#8221; (Shankarabharanam). Basically, devaranamas are keerthanas or sankeerthanas; not krithis, so their mode of presentation should be simple.And what are the dos? Ramakanth says some devaranamas may be preceded by ugabhogas (simple compositions resembling Sanskrit shlokas) compatible in meaning and bhava. For eg. Srikantan himself sings the ugabhoga &#8220;Adiyalli Gajamukhana&#8221; before the devaranama &#8220;Vandisuvudadiyali&#8221; (Nata).Also, devaranamas can be embellished with imaginative sangathis. Thirdly, one can improvise on rhythms. Most devaranamas were originally in khandachapu and mishrachapu, but we have set them to aadi taala, vilamba-aadi taala or roopaka taala, reveals Ramakanth. This is merely a small modification which doesn&#8217;t affect the presentation of lyrics. However, one mustn&#8217;t go too far, that is using jhampa, dhruva and aata taalas is wrong as they don&#8217;t fit into a devaranama&#8217;s textual context, he adds.It&#8217;s generally believed that devaranamas, being of light-classical genre, can only supplement and complement other lyrics. What do they say? Ramakanth replies that a full-fledged concert of devaranamas alone can be rendered if appropriate songs are selected. He points out that he and Srikantan have done several such concerts.But when a devaranama, or two, is part of a regular concert, where should it be placed within that larger format, I ask? Ramakanth says it can be at any point of the concert, provided it imparts colour and contrast to the preceding and succeeding item. For eg. a devaranama like &#8220;Narayana Ninnanama&#8221; can follow or precede heavy compositions like &#8220;Thyagaraja&#8217;s O Rangasayi&#8221; (Kambhoji) or &#8220;Akshayalingavibho&#8221; (Shankarabharanam).
