VA ll India Radio, Bangalore, recently hosted an evening of music as part of the Akashavani Sangeetha Sammelana 2010, a series of concerts held simultaneously in select cities across the country.The programme began with a Carnatic vocal concert by M. Sudhakar, accompanied by R. Dinakar (violin), G.V. Guru Bharadwaj (mridanga) and Mandapaka Ravi (khanjari). The first item was Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar's &#8220;Sri Mahaganapathim Bhajeham&#8221; in Athana raga and adi tala, suffixed with vibrant kalpana swaras. A quick, yet melodious detour of Lathangi followed, attesting to unswerving fidelity to classicism accentuated by a smooth and resonant voice. The Patnam Subrahmania Iyer composition &#8220;Marivere&#8221; set to khanda chapu thala, sung in a sedate tempo, was embellished with fluent kalpana swaras.An appealing rendition of &#8220;Entha Muddo&#8221;, Thyagaraja's mesmerising krithi in Bindumalini, preceded the main raga of the recital, Bhairavi. A crisp alapana permeated with the traditional essence of the raga heralded &#8220;Koluvaiyunnade Kodandapani&#8221; in adi tala, effectively highlighting its plethora of rapid, rolling sangathis. A compact neraval at &#8220;Manasu Ranjilla&#8221; and kalpana swaras in two speeds with a spell of diminishing tala cycles ending at the panchama, underscored by excellent support from the violinist, was rounded off with a brief, but sparkling tani avarthana. &#8220;Ramudu Bhavinchinadu&#8221;, a composition of Prayaga Rangadasa in Jhinjooti , brought the performance to a close.Santosh Nahar, accompanied by Ravindra Yavagal (tabla), then presented a scintillating Hindustani violin recital, in which raga Vachaspati was delineated in detail, followed by a tappa in Kafi, and concluding with the celebrated &#8220;Kesariya Balama&#8221; in Mand. The last segment of the day's proceedings was Mahila Talavadya Samavesh, a percussion ensemble comprising D. Sumathi Ramamohana Rao (mridanga), Sukanya Ramagopal (ghata), B.R. Latha (khanjari) and Bhagyalakshmi M. Krishna (morsing). The artistes exhibited exemplary synchronisation and exceptional expertise in their exploration of rhythmic permutations and combinations within the ambit of the adi tala.Vocalist Uma Kumar, accompanied by Sathya Prakash (violin), and B.S. Anand (mridanga), performed under the auspices of the Rajamahal Vilas Sangeetha Sabha recently.A lively beginning was made with the varna &#8220;Viriboni&#8221; in Kedaragoula raga and jhampa tala, followed by a short alapana of Shanmukhapriya and &#8220;Siddhivinayakam&#8221; adorned with effortless kalpana swaras. While the succinct elaboration of Darbar that preceded Thyagaraja's &#8220;Yochana Kamalalochana&#8221; was suffused with raga bhava, &#8220;Madhava Mamava&#8221; in Neelambari illumined the gentle lilt of both raga and lyrics. Skill and spontaneity were manifest in the expansion of Dharmavathi, remarkable for a sustained stint stressing the plain madhyama. The ensuing krithi, Deekshithar's &#8220;Paramdhamavathi&#8221;, was rendered with a neraval and free-flowing kalpana swaras.&#8220;Narasimha Mamava&#8221; in Arabhi was prelude to an exhaustive expansion of Todi, replete with intricate and brigha-laden sancharas, revealing impressive voice control and range. However, an occasional emphasis on the more reposeful aspects of the raga would have been welcome. The recital was enriched by a well-constructed tana and a pallavi set to aditala, presented with the mandatory rhythmic variations. Though the violinist seemed at times to exceed the mandate of the vocalist, overall support from both accompanists was outstanding.
