VHARISH BALKanyakumari is known to be selective about her concerts, and choosy about the artistes she accompanies. The artiste's solo violin recital for Rasikapriya at Kochi was testimony to her thorough professionalism and profound erudition.The first piece, a Nattakurinji varnam, was dynamic with a strong melodic content. Herkalpanaswarasfor `Mahaganapathim manasa smarami' saw a  creative mind at work, giving fresh swara patterns in every half cycle.Pensive moodWhile `Sogasajooda tharama' created a pensive mood, she blended all 10 ragas smoothly for Swati Tirunal's `Bhavayami Raghuramam.' `Sarasasamadana,' a Tyagaraja composition in Kapi Narayani, and `Maye' in Tharangini raga displayed thegayakistyle at its best.Kalyanavasantham was the piece-de-resistance. In this, one saw the flashes of her mentor M.L.V. in the swift jumps from thetara sthayito a lower note, and long brigas. The solid round timbre of the violin charmed in the long straight notes especially in upper shadjam and other tarasthayi swaras. The rare Dikshitar kriti `Sree Venkatesam' was chosen for rendition.`Ninnu vina' was played in the second speed from the charanam onwards. The plunks in between thechittaswarapassages were indeed charming. K. V. Prasad displayed skill in filling the gaps with some charming gumkis on the mridgangam. He followed the minute details of the sangatis of the kritis meticulously.Rapport between artistesKanyakumari presented a ragam tanam pallavi in two ragas  -   Shankarabharanam and Valaji. The blending and transition between the two ragas was  attempted with finesse and mastery. The pallavi in Adi thala was kept  short. Another veteran percussionist Thrikkakkara Shantharam on the kanjira seemed to strike a rapport with Prasad in the thaniyavarthanam.A Sayi bhajan (`Prem mudit man se kaho'), the Annamacharya composition in Bhujangini raga, `Krishna nee begane' (Yamunakalyani), `Baro Krishnayya' (ragamalika), `Eppo Varuvaro' (Jonpuri)and `Bhagyadalakshmi baramma' (Madhyamavati) were the concluding pieces. The emotion soaked `Om namo narayanaya' in Karnaranjini and Sindhubhairavi piece `Venkatachalanilayam' deserves  mention.Bottom Template Starts
