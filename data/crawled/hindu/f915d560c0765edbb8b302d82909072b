VTrained by worthies such as  Vechoor Harihara Subrahmania Iyer ( his uncle), Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, Kumara Kerala Varma, Vaikom Vasudevan Nambuthiri and so on, his concert steeped in traditional discipline, was tempered with &#8216;kalpana,&#8217; wherever it was necessary.Shankar&#8217;s  meticulous  selection included ragas brimming with the &#8216;ranjaka&#8217; factor and compositions to be rendered in the medium tempo, so as to keep the concert poised on an even keel. &#8216;Ramachandrena&#8217; in Maanji, composed by Dikshitar, was followed by a well chiselled delineation of &#8216;Saama.&#8217; &#8216;Annapoorne&#8217; had an excellent tapestry of swaras.&#8216;Vaachspathi&#8217; was unfurled in a dignified manner; the melodic passages  highlighted his conscientious training and sadhakam.   Swati Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Parama Purusha&#8217; in Vasantha was followed by a captivating depiction of &#8216;Madhyamavathi&#8217; and the  vocalist wove it seamlessly into &#8216;Ramakathaa Sudhaarasa.&#8217;Thirunellur Ajith Kumar played the violin.  Chengalam Sinesh Kumar, a disciple of Changanassey Hari Kumar, who handled the mridangam, promises to be an  able exponent of the powerful style of his mentor. Vechoor Jayan fingered the ghatom well.
