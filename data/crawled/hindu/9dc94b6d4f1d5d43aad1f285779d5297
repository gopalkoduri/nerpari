VIt is a refreshing experience one goes through when, mentally prepared to be patronising to a foreigner who makes the bold move to ascend the classical music concert stage at Chennai, the seat of excellence, during the Margazhi month, one gets knocke\u000ad down by the quality of the artist and the confidence with which he demonstrates his virtuosity. In addition, when the artist is a mere boy - a word used more in endearment than in condescension - the surprise turns into total delight. Anish King, an American national we understand, is doing his tenth grade in the International School in Bangkok, Thailand. He has already presented over a dozen concerts. Impressive as this sound, what adds more credential to him is that he has had training from violin maestro T.N. Krishnan and is now under the tutelage of M. Balakrishnan.The highest testimonial to him came from his performance on New Year&#8217;s eve at  Youth Hostel,  Indira Nagar, Adyar, for Hamsadhwani&#8217;s NRI festival. In a bare 90-minute span, Anish King made a mark in presenting classical Carnatic music through all its nuances in raga, tala and bhava with eminent competence and skill.There was clear evidence of meticulous homework done with seriousness in alapana in Shanmukhapriya followed by Patnam Subramania Iyer&#8217;s composition &#8216;Marivera Dikkevaraiya Rama&#8217; at a sprightly madhyama kalam in Adi.A slight perceptible exoticism notwithstanding, the gamakas came out pure. &#8216;Seethamma&#8217; played after this, in Vasanta with suddhamadhyamam sans panchama was a pleasant departure from the previous number, and continued the brisk pace, moving on to Madhyamavati and a simple rendering of Tyagaraja&#8217;s moving &#8216;Marukelara.&#8217;The main item was obviously Kiravani.  The short alapana, cautiously played, was not only flawless, but rich in raga lakshana, and executed with neat workmanship. Taking up the rather heavy kriti &#8216;Kalikiyunte Gata&#8217; of Tyagaraja and delivering it with faithful adherence to his master&#8217;s &#8216;bhani&#8217; competently was a feather in the cap of the young performer.There was a short tani avartanam between Ammangudi S. Ramanarayan and H. Prasanna (ghatam) after this chapter, aptly trimmed to the occasion.The two made a pair of gentle catalysts working to add melody and richness to the recital.With &#8216;Manasa Sanchara Re&#8217; in Sama and pleasant melodies in ragas Sindhubhairavi and Jhonpuri, Anish King wrapped up his tidy performance.
