VShakespeare&#8217;s reference to the world as a &#8216;stage&#8217; comes in Jaques&#8217; famous speech in &#8216;As You Like It&#8217; (&#8216;All the world&#8217;s a stage/and all the men and women merely players.&#8217;) The concept is  universal. In Indian philosophy too,  believers  feel it is He/She who makes us his/her toys and monitors it.  Therefore, those who have unswerving faith in God feel pleasure and pain in this world is part of  His creation.Bombay Sisters Saroja and Lalitha chose the title &#8216;Naan Oru Vilayattu Bommaya?&#8217; (Am I a toy for you?), the first line from the famous Navarasakannada composition of Papanasam Sivan, for their lec-dem at Indian Fine Arts Society.  Using this theme, they discussed  how several composers of the South (Tamil and Telugu) expressed their despair to God in search of liberation.Tyagaraja  speaks of creation, caring and conclusion by God in his Pancharatna kriti &#8216;Jagadananda&#8217; on the line &#8216;Srushti Sthithyam Tahara&#8217;. Appar, the Saivite saint, in his Thevaram claims that &#8216;Ammayum Nee Appanum Nee&#8217; and almost lists all the relationships with God. Adi Sankara in Annapurnashtakam says &#8216;Mathacha Parvati Devi Pita Devo Maheswara&#8217; while Tyagaraja sings &#8216;Seethamma Mayamma&#8217;.  Appar refers to it as &#8216;Attuvithal Aar Oruvar Adathaare.&#8217;Like a kid who becomes fond of a particular toy, if God likes one of his devotees, he tests their attachment to Him using several ploys. So philosophers and devotees seek  salvation. Lines such as &#8216;Punarapi Jananam Punarapi Maranam&#8217; in &#8216;Bhajagovindam&#8217; and &#8216;Marupadiyum Karuvariyin Kuzhil Talli Varuthapadavendaam&#8217; in &#8216;Tiruvadi Charanam&#8217; (Khambodi) by Gopalakrishna Bharati, emphasise this.Krishna played with everyone, including his mother Yasodha, his friends and the gopikas. Many  references were drawn about this from Oothukadu Venkatakavi, Purandaradasar, Tyagaraja and Bharatiyar. The same Krishna became the preacher of Bhagavad Gita where he told Arjuna to  &#8216;do your duty and do not look for results&#8217; on the battlefield. Tyagaraja made a point about it in &#8216;Allanadu Kauravu&#8217; in the kriti &#8216;Bhagananayya&#8217; in Chandrajyothi.It was Tyagaraja who expressed a variety of emotions such as love, anger, despair and praise  towards Rama in his kritis. Syama Sastry, a staunch devotee of Devi, never chided her; he only pleaded and submitted to Her in all his kritis. The Bombay Sisters quoted &#8216;O Jagadamaba&#8217; (Anandabhairavi), &#8216;Kamakshi&#8217; (Bhairavi), &#8216;Brovavamma&#8217; (Manji) and &#8216;Devi Brova&#8217; (Chintamani) where his emotions were poignantly expressed by the composer. Bharatiyar&#8217;s &#8216;Theeratha Vilayattu Pillai&#8217;  depicted the mischievous acts of Krishna.Portions of Soundaryalahiri and &#8216;Abhirami Anadathi&#8217; also figured in the lecture by Lalitha and Saroja.Siva&#8217;s escapades were popularly known as &#8216;Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam&#8217; only. Muthuswami Dikshitar and Arunagirinathar have their exchanges with Muruga.The Bombay Sisters  summed up by reiterating that all our acts are controlled by  God and we have no option but to submit ourselves to His will. As concluding pieces, they chose Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Mathainnum Vada&#8217; in Sriranjani and &#8216;Naan Oru Vilayattu Bommaya&#8217;. As was their wont, they sang several passages from the kritis and slokas, which were charged with emotion.
