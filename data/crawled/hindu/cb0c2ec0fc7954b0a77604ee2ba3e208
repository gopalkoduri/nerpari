VNada Bharathi&#8217;s  constant endeavour has been to revive the rendition of Carnatic concerts in a traditional manner. This music sabha held a Sampradaya music festival at Thyagaraya Gana Sabha.ARagam-Tanam-Pallavipiece and aslokawere made a mandatory part of the repertoire.The festival opened with a  vocal recital  by one of the most promising young musicians, Venumadhav, who is  many a classical dancer&#8217;s  vocalist of choice.He is gifted with a mellifluous, virile and resonant voice besides being endowed with a great sense forsahitya.His concert recently  had all the parameters of a  Sampradaya concert.Ragam-Tanam-Pallaviin Kalyani was a sheer delight , mirroring the artiste&#8217;s versatility .Venumadhav chose Mohana as hisPallavi Raga, which was set to Adi Talam. Theragaessay,Tanam, and theswarakalpanain thepallavipart reflected his positive approach and skill in  entertaining the audience.Bharati, Bhagavati Vandanamwas thepallaviline, which  he presented  in manysancharies. TheTanamand theswarasinpallaviexhibited his potential.The artiste opened his show with a Bhairaviatatala varnamand followed it with aslokaof Annamacharya in Nata. Nadatanumanisam in Chittaranjani was  next. Sadachaleswaram, a rare composition of Deekshitar in Bhoopalam, was  another melodious presentation  by Venumadhav.Himadri Sutheof Syamasastry in Kalyani andIde Parabrahmain Reethigowla were also examples of his ability  to renderkritieswithSahityabhava. Though brief, Amrutavarshini was his first essay.  Thekritiin it,Anandamruthakarshini, was enjoyable. He also treated Thodi in detail for Thyagaraja&#8217;sAaragimpave.  He presented this withnerevalandswarakalpana.At this stage, he took up theRagam Tanam-Pallavipiece. Rajasekar on the violin lent good support throughout the concert with  the vocalist&#8217;s musical phrases inragaorswaraeliciting a good response.Kapa Srinivasa Rao also proved to be a good hand  at playing the mridangam .HisTaniwith T.P Balu on ghatam was interesting.Venumadhav concluded his recital with aragamalika slokamand an Annamacharyakirtana,Akativelala. A big  advantage with Venumadhav&#8217;s rendition is that he  vocalises every word ofsahityawith perfect intonation, a quality  that other youngsters would do well to  pick up from him.G.S
