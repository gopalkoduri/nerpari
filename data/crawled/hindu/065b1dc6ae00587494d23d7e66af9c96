VClarity of diction, perfect alignment to sruti and sukhanubhava characterised the vocal recital of Lakshmi Rangarajan featured under the aegis of Rasika Ranjana sabha at Thyagaraja Hall in Kolkata.The artist has all the ingredients of an accomplished singer. Her  commencement of the concert with a winsome presentation of Sri raga varnam followed by &#8216;Mahaganapathim&#8217; (Nattai) with sarvalaghu swaras was a prelude to a lively musical session.Lakshmi&#8217;s  raga vinyasam of Purvi Kalyani for the kriti, &#8216;Gnanamosagarada&#8217; was replete with fluent sancharas showing her vidwat. The niraval at &#8216;paramatmudu&#8217; and the accompanying swaras drew wide appreciation.Lakshmi&#8217;s  raga essay of Sankarabharanam for the kriti, &#8216;Sarojadalanetri&#8217; (the main piece of the concert) negotiating with an effortless ease in the higher octaves revealed a rich tapestry of its rakti passages.&#8216;Chandrasekharasaraswati Charanam&#8217; (Hindolam) was a soulful rendition rich in aesthetics.The tukkadas towards the end were snacks to the cognoscenti.Niladri Rao&#8217;s elegant and graceful violin accompaniment demonstrated his virtuosity in the solo versions.Srinivasan (mridangam) and Sairam (ganjira) proved their laya mettle adequately without disturbing the creative process of the vocalist.
