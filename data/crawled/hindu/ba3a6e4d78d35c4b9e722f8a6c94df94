VKalpadruma&#8217;s Art and Artists annual festival this year featured Sanjay Subrahmanyam on the first day at the Sivagami Pethatchi Auditorium last weekend.Warming up with a Hindolam varnam Sanjay started in earnest  with a well-paced Yochana (Darbar-Adi-Tyagaraja) with kalpanaswaras that were very spontaneous. In the next alapana Sanjay kept the audience guessing initially. Once into the nucleus of Sahana, full justice was done with a mixture of long karvais and briga-oriented phrases. A composed Varadarajan (violin) complimented with a well-etched reply.Dehi Tava Pada Bhaktim (Adi-Tyagaraja) saw Thanjavur Ramadass (mridangam) in his elements with interesting tekkas and arudis.  Sanjay  showed new depths of Sankarabharanam with contemplative pauses. The ruminative karvais  highlighted fertile imagination, thereby helping Sanjay essay a memorable one. Varadarajan&#8217;s delineation made Sankarabharanam wholesome.A slow paced &#8216;Akshaya Linga&#8217; (Mishram-Dikshitar) gave enough space for Sanjay to  explore the raga further in the niraval phase when he reminded one of  Madurai Somasundaram.Beginning &#8216;Sivakamasundari&#8217; (Mukhari-Adi -Sivan) from anupallavi that had an emotional tinge, Sanjay went on to present a neat sketch of Kumudhakriya (Ardhanareeshwaram-Rupakam-Dikshitar). The Madyamavathi exposition was surprisingly brief yet authentic. &#8216;Saravanabhava Guhane&#8217; (Adi-Sivan) was well executed followed by kalpanaswaras in two speeds that were logical. The thani of Thanjavur Ramadoss and K.V.Gopalakrishnan (ganjira) comprised interesting exchanges.It was heartening to see Sanjay revive  Mavallakadamma (Maand-Adi-Chitoor), a song that was popularised by Madurai Somu.The second day of the festival featured Sreevalson Menon. Gifted with a voice without any blemish Sreevalson was off to a sweet start with Swati Tirunal&#8217;s Khambodi varnam.The artistic structuring of kalpanaswaras that adorned the next piece &#8216;Pranamamyaham&#8217; (Gowlai-Adi-Mysore Vasudevachar) only indicated, what was in store for the rest of the evening.The Sri Raga alapana was fulsome and unhurried. M.A. Sundaresan (violin) took the rasikas to greater heights.&#8216;Sri Varalakshmi&#8217; was an apt choice to suit the Varalakshmi Vratham mood. The vishranthi continued with swaras within grammatical limits.A faster &#8216;Sitapati Naa Manasuna&#8217; (Khamas-Adi-Tyagaraja) with niraval in Prema Jhoochi gave the needed fillip to the schedule. The Anandabhairavi alapana began at a sedate pace and the edifice was built with phrases oozing with bhavam.MAS continued where Menon left off. His sancharas in the mandhara sthayi were breathtaking.The majestic Kamalamba (Mishram-Dikshitar) was well rendered. A brisk Parama Purusha (Vasantha-Adi-Swati) came in like an end change bowler.Umayalpuram Sivaraman (Mridangam) took the concert to soaring heights with his enthusiastic playing that was a mixture of pauses, simple nadais and intricate patterns.The man&#8217;s energy at his age is seen to be believed. Students of laya irrespective of the school to which they belong to should make it a point to attend concerts of such veterans for their own benefit.Saveri was showcased with nectarine phrases both by Sreevalson and MAS. &#8216;Anjaneya&#8217; (Adi-Swati) rarely heard these days, was soaked in devotion with niraval and swaras that did not mar the mood. B. Shree Sundar Kumar (ganjira) finally made his presence felt in the tani that followed with Umayalpuram, who was at his best.The background in the stage was tastefully decorated with Mandhara leaves, leaving one yearning for hotVen Pongalserved on it.
