VIn a review of vocalist Geetha Raja's performance in Chennai during the 2009 winter season, I had made the following comments: &#8220;... Uniquely colourful swara sequences spring from instinctive resources and inspiring influences, rather than from any conscious acts of learning. A vidushi who is apparently endowed with this rare gift is Geetha Raja.... I must add a proviso that Geetha still has some vistas to explore for realising her full potential. But I do believe she's capable of creating a brand image for herself as an improviser, in due course.&#8221; ( www.thehindu.com/Friday Review/Feb. 12, 2010)I am glad to note that in the course of this past year she has made impressive progress in exploring another exciting vista, in the form of beautiful spells of niraval leading to the fluent flow of improvised swaras. What this calls for (among other things, obviously!) is a very sensitive selection of compositions.Adding to this are the facts that Geetha's rich and flexible voice has acquired a certain glow and also that her raga alapanas tend to have a more finely chiselled shape. One can't resist the impression that sheer beauty is the essential quality her music is surely and steadily attaining.The highlightsThe twin highlights of Geetha's recent concert at the Music Academy provided substantial evidence of these important aspects of her progress. They were the concise and exquisite raga alapanas of Todi and Kalyani; the repetitive recitation of the beautiful phrases &#8216;Manasukento Aanandamai' and &#8216;Nee Paada Pankajamu&#8230;' in the songs &#8216;Ninuvinaa Sukhamugaana' and &#8216;Biraana Brova' by Tyagaraja and Tarangambadi Panchanada Iyer respectively; and, of course, the brilliant swara sequences which followed.Several other songs were rendered briefly, including &#8216;Himaachala Tanaya' (Anandabhairavi, Syama Sastri), &#8216;Brihannaayaki' (Andhali, Dikshitar) and &#8216;Niddirayil' (Pantuvarali, Ghanam Krishna Iyer), but throughout the concert the singer maintained a leisurely tempo which was so characteristic of the style of her illustrious guru T. Brinda, in whose honour the event was organised.Sensitively responsive accompaniment was provided by V. Sanjeev on the violin; Umayalpuram Mali's mridangam was well attuned to the whole tenor of the music, which was as reposeful as it was radiant.The concluding number was a philosophic Tamil verse of Thayumanavar (&#8216;Kandhuga Madakkariyai...') which was close to Brinda's heart. She used to sing it as a viruttam in ragamalika.Geetha's own version in the raga chain of Mohanam, Kanada, Yadukulakhambodi, Varali, and Suratti was an earnestly nostalgic exercise. The sentimental mood was enhanced by the presence of another of Brindamma's disciples, Aruna Sairam.
