VThe vocalist commenced his recital with a lively rendering of &#8216;Pahi Sri Padhe&#8217; in Hamsadwani.This was  followed by a brisk rendering of swaras in &#8216;Jaya Jaya Padmanabha Murare&#8217; in Sarasangi, set to Adi talam.An elaborate raga vistaram preceded &#8216;Deva Deva Jagadeeswara&#8217; in Poorvikalyani.However, the highlight of the evening was a Swati Tirunal kriti in Kamboji. A janya of Harikambhoji, Swati Tirunal has referred to the raga as Kamodari. Suited for all occasions, nishadam is avoided in the arohanam. The kriti chosen was &#8216;Padasa Nadhi&#8217; a kirti that is rarely attempted by musicians at kutcheris. Sankaran Nambudiri&#8217;s rendition was noted for its alapanam, stress on the sahitya and swara prastharam.  The tristhayi prayogas, which was rendered with finesse, was met with applause.S.R. Mahadeva Sarma gave able support on the violin. A lengthy thaniavarthanam was performed on the mridangam by Trivandrum Surendran and on the ghatam by Trivandrum Kartikeyan. &#8216;Gopanandana&#8217; in Bhushavali, a janya of Dharmavati, stood out for its pleasing notes.Sankaran Nambudiri also sang a Hindi bhajan &#8216;Janana Janana Payal Bhaje&#8217; in Hamsanandi and concluded his concert with &#8216;Mohanamai,&#8217; a Swati padam in Yadukulakambhoji.The concert was held as a part of the birthday celebrations of Uthradom Tirunal Marthanda Varma.
