VVISAKHA MUSIC Academy featured a vocal recital by Mysore Nagamani Sainath of Bangalore in Kalabharathi last week as part of its monthly schedule.Endowed with a sonorous voice, she regaled the audience for a little over two-and-a-half hours with style and sagacity.Veteran vidwan, Kokkonda Subrahmanya Sarma from Angara on violin, knowledgeable Mandapaka Nagalakshmi on mridangam and Mangalagiri Sridhar on ghatam lent excellent support.A brief but beautiful spell of `aalapana' followed by evocative rendering of "Sivasivayanarada" (`Pantuvarali') set the tone. Then followed "Kaalaharanamelara" of Thyagaraja (`Suddasaveri'), "Ammaraavamma" of the same `vaggeyakara' (`Kalyani').The piece-de-resistance of the evening was her own composition `ragam', `tanam' and `pallavi'; "Taamarasadala Netri" in `Shanmukhapriya' which turned out to be a scholarly sojourn where `aalapana' and `taanam', and `gathi' and `yathi' negotiated the `pallavi' before concluding with elaborate `swarakalpana' in the two speeds.Kokkanda on violin especially in his turns of `aalapana' and `swaram', Nagalakshmi with her brilliant choice of `jathis' with sweet vibrant touch very well supported on the `upataalavaadyam' ghatam by Sridhar contributed grandeur.Enthralling rendition of a "Devaranama' ("Noodidevara") in `Kalaavathi', `Daasaripadam' in `Multan' and her own `thillana' in `Vaasantha' constituted the thrilling tailpiece.Lecturer, Department of Music, Andhra University, and noted vocalist, Mandapaka Sarada, proposing a vote of thanks, made a critical assessment of concert and described it a veritable and wholesome feast of the Carnatic vocal.A.R.S.Bottom Template Starts
