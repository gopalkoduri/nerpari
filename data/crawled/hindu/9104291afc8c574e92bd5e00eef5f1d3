VThe Nallan Chakravarthula family of musicians is particularly noted for its creativity. N. Ch. Parthasarathi, one of the leading vocalists among the younger generation musicians, belongs to the family. Kasheeragara Sangeetha Sabha provided him an opportunity last week to perform at the Thyagaraya Gana sabha.Parthasarathi sang in the company of R. Dinakar on violin and Krishna Prakash on mridangam. He opened with a rareNalinakanthi varnam, composed by a senior of the Nallan Chakravarthulas, Sri Murthy, himself a talented singer and composer. Thevarnamreflected his vocal skills. After obeisance to Lord Ganapathi through the composition of Muthaiah Bhagavatar, Parthasarathi chose to singRanganathudeinSourashtra.Impressive renditionAfter another briefkritiMarugelarainJayanthisri, he choseShanmukhapriyaas his firstragaeffort. He sangPalu Vicharamulelawithsahityaimport and thenerevalandswaramcould carry theragamood. Then appearedKoluvaiunnadeinDevagandhari, in enjoyable piece indeed. But the subsequentThyagaraja Yogavaibhavamof Deekshitar inAnanda Bhairavithrilled the audience for the way he went formridanga yatistyled presentation.Bilahariwas his main showpiece, along withDorakuna Ituvantiwithnerevalandswaras,andthaniin it. Parthasarathi presented this piece extremely well.Bilaharigained a beautiful picture, at once elegant and imposing. Then the rendition ofDorakunahad in itself a mood of musicians thrill, as `he prays to god through this medium of music'. He sang with clarity ofsahitya. Thenerevalandswarastoo were a treat. The violinist's responses and his own versions ofBilahariandShanumukhapriyaearlier were praise worthy. TheThani Avartanamby the mridangist was neat.Bayarani Vanide, aJavaliinKapiand Patnam's briskthillanainKhamasconcluded this most authentic and pleasing recital.G.S.Bottom Template Starts
