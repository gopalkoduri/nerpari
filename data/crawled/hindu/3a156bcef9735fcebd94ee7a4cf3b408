VThe legendary late Maharajapuram V. Santhanam's sons, Maharajapuram S. Srinivasan and Maharajapuram S. Ramachandran, were featured by two organisations in the Capital recently. The siblings delighted the two set of audience by presenting songs, many of which their late father used to sing at concerts. As soon as the concert of Srinivasan began, the assembled rasikas started sending chits to the vocalist requesting for certain songs. Like the late father who would always honour such requests, Srinivasan too sang the songs one by one in quick succession. Ramachandran too sang a song composed by Ootukkadu Venkatasubbaiyer at the request of a rasika. While Ramachandran was featured jointly by the Chennai-based Naadhabrahmam and the Delhi Tamil Sangam in the latter's auditorium, Srinivasan was featured by the Delhi-based Dwarakalaya at the auditorium of Karnataka Sangha. While Ramachandran started his concert with a short virutham before presenting the invocation song on Lord Ganesha, &#8220;Sadasivan maindane&#8221; in raga Hamswadhani composed by his father, Srinivasan started with the Ata thala varnam in Kanada raga, before singing Tyagaraja's &#8220;Abishta varada&#8221;, also in raga Hamswadhani. Both the artistes suffixed detailed swaraprastharas to build the tempo as they proceeded.While Ramachandran took up Ootukkadu Venkatasubbaiyer's &#8220;Needaan mechikolla vendum&#8221; in raga Sriranjani and Papanasam Sivan's &#8220;Unnai allal&#8221; in raga Kalyani for detailed renditions, Srinivasan took up Tyagaraja's &#8220;Chala kallaladu&#8221; in raga Arabhi and Patnam Subramanya Iyer's &#8220;Nijadasa varada&#8221; in raga Kalyani. The siblings sang Purandara Dasar's &#8220;Narayanaa&#8221; in raga Suddha Dhanyasi and brought out the emotive aspects of the lyrics.Ganesh Viswanathan, Srinivasan's son, provided able vocal support to his father. While Ramachandran was accompanied by Tirupathi-based K.V. Krishna on the violin, Srinivasan was accompanied by the Chennai-based violinist M.A. Sundareswaran. Both the accompanists provided excellent support. Their exposition of ragas, Sriranjani, Arabhi and Kalyani, was delightful. Particularly, Sundareswaran took just half the time that was taken by the vocalist when it was his turn to delineate a raga. Even in a short time the accomplished violinist brought out the complete nuances of the raga that he delineated. Delhi-based K.N. Padmanabhan too provided excellent support on the mridangam to both the sibilings. Tirupathi-based Madhubabu and Delhi-based Mannai Kannan provided good support on the ghatam in these concerts.A. KanyakumariIn another concert organised by Dwarakalaya, A. Kanyakumari too delighted the rasikas in her violin concert, in which her disciple Vittal Rangan provided ablesupport. Kanyakumari took up two Tyagaraja's compositions, &#8220;Dharini thelusukonti&#8221; in raga Suddha Saveri and &#8220;Swararagasudha&#8221; in raga Shankarabharanam for a detailed rendering. The expositions of these ragas were mellifluous and she presented these compositions in a riveting kalaparamanam (rhythm cycle). Tyagaraja's other compositions like &#8220;Sogasujooda&#8221; in raga Kannadagowla and &#8220;Nannuvidachi&#8221; in raga Reethigowla too underwent fine treatment. Her playing style which was close to vocal music, helped many an audience to get a feel instantly of what she was playing. Chennai-based K.V. Prasad who provided the mridangam support, was not quite comfortable with the audio system and was not at his best in the concert. Delhi's Vetri Boopathy accompanied her in the kanjira. On the whole, it was an enthralling concert with some enchanting music that was reflective of her scholarship in the field.
