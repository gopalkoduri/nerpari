VThe sprawling green lawns of the Rajarani temple complex with the 11th century sculptural marvel serving as the backdrop provided an apt ambience for the three-day Rajarani national music festival hosted by the tourism department of Government of Orissa in collaboration with the four-decade-old Bhubaneswar Music Circle.Celebrated vocalists of the nation like Pandit Chhanulal Mishra, Vidushi Bombay Jayashree and Vidushi Uma Garg were featured in the festival that also offered opportunity to the emerging and established artistes like tabla player Kalinath Mishra, mardal player Sachidananda Das and flutist Sudarsan Das. And being Orissa&#8217;s own event, each evening had a segment for the artistes of the state.Noted musicologist and Hindustani vocalist Chhanulal Mishra of Benaras captivated the audience with unique rendition of khayals, thumris, dadras, kajris, chaitis and bhajans that included a brilliant recital of the raga Yaman Kalyan.Similar was Carnatic music&#8217;s celebrated singer, composer, teacher and author Bombay Jayashree from Chennai whose recitals dedicated to Lord Ganesh and Lord Shiva mesmerised one and all.Professor Uma Garg from the faculty of performing arts of Delhi University regaled with rendition raga Jog followed by khayals and thumris.Though an exclusive festival for Indian classical music, ghazal was included for the first time this year. Octogenarian ghazal singer S.Vithal Rao from Hyderabad, the last living court singer of the Nizam of Hyderabad, was invited to the event.A disciple of the legendary Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Rao was a singing sensation as a court musician in pre-independent India.A staff artiste of the All India Radio, Cuttack, flautist Sudarsan Das&#8217; recital of raga Kalyan in vilambit, madhyalaya and drut mode was fantastic.The jugalbandi between the two established percussionists &#8212; mardal player Sachidananda Das and tabla player Kulamani Sahoo was an exciting presentation.The most pulsating presentation however, was the fusion by four brilliant artistes &#8212; guitar player Jaywant Naidu from Hyderabad, saxophone artiste Shyam Raj from Bengaluru, ghatam player Giridhar Udupa from Chennai and tabla player Kalinath Mishra from Mumbai.It&#8217;s an irony that despite being Orissa&#8217;s only national music festival and being hosted by the state government, Odissi music did not get a space in it much to the disappointment of the Odissi fraternity and the connoisseurs as well.
