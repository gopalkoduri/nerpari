VTulasi&#8217;s dexterity came to the fore right in the initial stagesIt was a concert devoid of much publicity. Nevertheless,  those who did turn up to hear it were a delighted lot. They got to hear some kritis rich in traditional musical values. In her spirited performance, fighting a losing battle against the  hopeless microphone system, Tulasi Vishwanath from Rajamundhri, Andhra Pradesh, put up a very impressive show recently in a concert organised by the Ganesh Seva Samaj in East Delhi.Tulasi&#8217;s dexterity in the field of Carnatic music came to the fore right in the initial stages of her concert. Her handling of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Tulasi dalamulache&#8221; in the raga Mayamalavagowla was brilliant. Not only did she give utmost care  to the sahitya contents of this kriti,  she also handled creatively the niraval of a phrase from the charanam  as well as the subsequent swaraprastharas.  Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Rajagopalam&#8221; in the raga Mohanam was marked  by a fine alap of the raga in the beginning and some melodious swara formats towards the end. Yet another  Dikshitar kriti, &#8220;Seshachala Nayakam Bajami&#8221; in raga Varali also underwent fine treatment. Earlier, Tulasi presented a scintillating alap of this raga, which had considerable depth. The subsequent niraval and swaraprastharas  exhibited, yet again, her manordharma talents. The fast tempo song of Harikesanallur  Muthiah Bhagavatar, &#8220;Durgadevi&#8221; in the raga Navarasakanada was impressive.As her main item, Tulasi presented Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Koluvamare gada&#8221; in the raga Todi. Her mother tongue being Telugu, she had a distinct advantage in bringing  the sahitya bhava of this kriti to the fore. In addition, the subsequent niraval of the phrase &#8220;Veguvajhamuna velayuchu thambura jekoni gunamula jeluvontha padusu&#8221; and the swaraprastaras were creatively handled. K.L.N. Sastri on the violin and P. Jayabhaskar (Tulasi&#8217;s brother) on the mridangam provided understanding and excellent support to Tulasi. While Sastri&#8217;s delineation of the ragas Mohanam and Todi was melodious, Jayabhaskar&#8217;s tani avartanam in Adi tala was delightful. On the whole, a spirited   performance of high quality.
