VThe first Sri Ramanavami Music series at Mysore was inaugurated in 1920 at Bidaram Prasanna Sita Rama Mandira. A recent seminar on the vaggeyakaras organised by Lalithakala Academy Foundation, Mysore, threw light on the early pioneers of the tradition. This tradition, going on for the last eight decades, has given an opportunity to many local musicians this time.  The new cultural outfit Prasanna Sundarama Mandira at Krishnamurthypuram  and Sri Ramaseva Mandali Charitable Trust, Mysore North, are providing maximum concerts to native talents. The violin duo by Hosur Venkataram and Satyanarayana at Bidaram Prasanna Seetharama Mandira got the glimpse of Lalgudi School from where they sought advanced training. However, the artistes dwelt more with popular compositions. Starting from "Vatapi Ganapathim" (Hamsadwani) followed by the well-known pancharatna "Endaro Mahanubhavalu", they took other compositions in ragas Dhenuka ("Teleyaledu Rama") Anandabhairavi ("Marivera") in Misrachapu, and Aarabhi ("Sri Saraswathi" of Mysore Vasudevacharya). The outline of raga Amruthavarshini (Dikshitar's "Anandamruthakarshini") was well articulated. However, the prime characteristics of janti and daatu svaraprayogas in svaraprastara was not fully explored to enhance the beauty of this well known janyaraga. Guruvayur Dorai on mridanga and P.S. Ramanujam (morsing) gave adequate support to the concert. The veena concert by R.K. Raghavan at Prasanna Sundara Rama Mandira was another impressive performance. Coming from school of vainika vidwan late R.S. Keshavamuthy, Vidwan Raghavan exhibited excellent artistry of gamaka prayogas in anu-mamandira and athi-tara stayies while delineating the ragas Isha Manohari (Tyagaraja's "Manasa Sri Ramachandruni") and Hamsanandi ("Needu Mahima" of Muthaiah Bhagavatar) with rhythmical tana. Shudda Dhanyasi, Goulai, and Hamsanadam were equally inspiring.B.S.S. RAOBottom Template Starts
