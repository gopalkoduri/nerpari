VAs soon as she started singing &#8220;Aaja nach le&#8221;, the audience started dancing to the tune. Yet another number &#8220;Hakim Tarachand zara kothe pe aana&#8221; was popular among the listeners. Shibani also obliged the crowd by singing the songs of their choice. &#8220;Life peechey peechey khwab aage aage&#8221;, from &#8220;Sirf&#8221;, for which she has composed the music, went down well with the audience too. Incidentally, with this film she has become a rare woman composer in the film industry.Shibani kept the whole crowd spellbound with the magic of her voice and versatility. She was full of praise for the audience, adding, &#8220;This was one of my best performances with such a lively and happening crowd, people were singing and dancing with me and knew all my numbers very well. Not even a single person left the place before the show ended!&#8221;Talking about her future album, Shibani said, &#8220;As I am growing I am getting more philosophical and my new album will be on the same lines.&#8221; It will be out shortly, added the singer.
