VThe sight of two spotted deer peeping out of their hiding behind the trunk of a huge tree seemed something out of this world.The serenity continued with the welcome of the perfectly tuned tanpura sruti inside the auditorium. The mood for the evening was already set. It was Lakshmi Sriram&#8217;s Hindustani vocal recital under the auspices of Music Club , IIT, to the accompaniment of Viresh Madri on the harmonium and R. Suresh on the tabla.Notable among the audience was M.S.Ananth, Director, IIT, his spouse and Prof T.T.Narendran, an accomplished vainika.Lakshmi presented Poorya Kalyan with two compositions &#8216;Hovan Lagi Saanch&#8217; in the vilmabit laya and &#8216;Bahut dhin bhi te&#8217; in the dhrut laya both set to teen taal after a brief alap that served as a warm up. It took some time for the sound engineer to realise that the tabla was too loud. Unperturbed, Lakshmi stuck to business. Lingering over the lower nishadam and mid-gandharam, during the alap, she put you in a  trance.The second one was two compositions in Nand, a rarely heard raag in this part of the country, she presented them in the Madhya laya and Dhrut laya both set to Teen taal. Her voice control, particularly in the dhrut was simply astonishing. That she could infuse melody even in that segment only went to prove her capability.The toast of the evening was  Bageshri. Lakshmi did not spare any effort to showcase its intrinsic beauty. The cascading phrases were an aural treat.  The composition &#8220;Sakhi Man Laagen&#8221; in the vilambit laya was set to teen taal while the second composition &#8220;Bega Bega Aawon&#8221; in dhrut was set to ek taal.Lakshmi was able to get into the mood of this major night raga right from the word go. Laced with intricate swaras, sometimes delicately  poised, Lakshmi proved that she was adept at sargam too.The thumri was about Radha pining for Lord Krishna and Lakshmi&#8217;s interpretation was perfect followed by a fast paced Marathi Natya sangeet &#8220;Ekala Naya Naan&#8221; where Rukmini expresses that her eyes can see only Lord Krishna and nothing else.Viresh Madri was subdued on his harmomium while R.Suresh with his controlled playing wove interesting patterns.Lakshmi wound up with a slow paced Meera Bhajan tuned by Kishori Amonkar and a relatively faster Kabir Bhajan set to tune by Pt. Kumar Gandharva, even as one was left yearning for more.
