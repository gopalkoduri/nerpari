VThe monthly schedule of Visakha Music Academy featured a vocal recital at Kalabharathi last Saturday. The head of the department of music, Chidambaram, from Annamalai University in Tamil Nadu, and noted vocalist B. Govindarajan rendered it in the harmonious company of Maavuduru Satyanarayana Sarma on violin, B.V.S. Prasad on mridangam and Mandapaka Ravi on kanjira.Govindarajan sustained a leisurely tempo and began with Bhairavi varnam. Surfacing a commanding continuance of the expression of the emotions embedded in the lyrical and the musical phraseology of the composition all around (hisaalapanasthemselves were indicative of the composition he was going to sing) he seemed to be making the tradition of exposition (carnatic music) of yesteryears renascent.Lack of concern for punctuating the lyrical part properly with the same diligence notwithstanding, thanks to the succinctly commensurable support rendered by the accompanists in their following and turns, he succeeded in realising his goal and delighted all.After the varnam, he renderedSivatraya Mahaganapathi(Naata) prefixed with vibrantaalapana,Mahadevasambho(Revathi),Entamuddo &#8212; Entasogaso(Bindumaalini),Anuragamuleni(Saraswathi) embellished withaalapana, neravuandswaram,Kanjadalayatakshi(Kamala Manohari),Aadamodigalada(Charukesi) with elaborateaalapanaandswarambefore he expatiatedDurusuga(Saveri). The eruditethaniexecuted by Prasad and Ravi provided the grand finale.
