VO.S. Arun&#8217;s popularity is more as a singer of bhajans and abhangs than as a traditional Carnatic concert performer. His wide repertoire and  flexible voice have made him a sought-out artiste for bhajan sandhya concerts. Ten compositions of vari\u000aous composers have been sung by Arun in the recently released DVD titled &#8216;Vipulam&#8217; by Amutham Music P Ltd.&#8216;Palisamma Muddu Sharade&#8217; in Sriranjani (Purandaradasa) is the opening number. The hand gestures and facial expressions of the vocalist match the structure of the sangathis in this composition.  The absence of a manual tambura is glaring especially in a DVD recording.A folksy varnamettu is employed for the Mohanam number &#8216;Vadana Suhasyarasala&#8217; (Samartha Ramadasa). Arun&#8217;s brief vinyasa of Kalyanavasantham in the Hindustani genre is totally sruthi aligned.  A Marathi abhang &#8216;Thoomaja&#8217; which follows is a spirited rendering.The pure Carnatic segment in this DVD is displayed in the few phrases of Bhairavi raga sung by Arun.  A Bhadrachalam Ramadas composition in Eka tala (Tisra Nadai) &#8216;Alola Tulasi&#8217; is energetically vocalised.The Brindavani alapana is done dramatically employing the usage of &#8216;Hari&#8217; for the exposition. Swati Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Chaliye&#8217; is the chosen number in Bridavani.The virutham on the Lord at Kadirgamam in Srilanka is sung as a prelude to the beautiful composition of Kavignar Vaali&#8217;s &#8216;Kooviazhaithaal&#8217; in Valaji which has been set to tune by Thanjavur S. Kalyanaraman.  Jayadeva&#8217;s &#8216;Nindati Chandana&#8217; (Darbari Kanada) is rendered with ease by the singer.  The continuity in the singing of this Ashtapathi takes a backseat due to the long gaps in between the verses.The DVD comes to a close with Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Namo Namo Raghavaya.&#8217; This song is normally sung in Desiya Thodi. Arun does the same though the inlay card mentions the same as Sindu Bhairavi. The accompanists are M.R. Gopinath (violin), A.V. Manikandan (mridangam), S. Ganapathi (tabla) and S. Selvam for timing.VIPULAMAmutham Music P Ltd.O.S ArunCarnatic &#8211; DVD &#8211; PriceRs. 399
