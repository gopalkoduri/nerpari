VWhen Sampagodu Vighnaraja, a young singer of potential, sang at Ganabharathi in Mysore. Before launching into an analysis, broad parameters such as classicism-form, simplicity, proportion and restraint in addition to the element of devotion in the Indian context need to be outlined. Though some of the above pre-requisites were missing, there remained no ambiguity as to the singer's competence and scholarship. He has good voice, not necessarily resonant - yet, pleasing and impressive - always in readiness to serve his improvisational commands modulating to any degree unmindful of the speed.The very first presentation\u000a- Ramnad\u000aShrinivasa Iyengar's\u000avarna "Vanajakshiro"\u000a(Kalyani) amply substantiated\u000athe above remarks\u000awhen he sung in\u000adifferent speeds, at full\u000atilt, passing through\u000aprecise laya-variations.\u000aNow, considering the\u000aproportions of the devotional\u000acontents the\u000acompositions expected\u000athe emotions (rasas) the\u000aragas warranted. They\u000adeserved better attention\u000ain order to uphold\u000athe sentiments of the\u000acomposers.Jayachamaraja Wadiyar's\u000a"Shi Mahagapathim"\u000a(Atana),\u000a"Sakethanagaranatha"\u000a(Harikamboji - Mysore\u000aSadashiva Rao) disappointed\u000athe listeners as\u000athe former was deprived\u000aof its majesty\u000aand the latter of its import.\u000aFurther, it was almost\u000aimpossible to\u000apeacefully follow the\u000aneraval at "Rajitha Amarapala"\u000a(Sakethanagaranatha)\u000a- the\u000aspoilsport being over\u000aspeeding, rhythm-oriented\u000aaccentuations\u000aand fiery display of the\u000aswarakalpanas.On the contrary,\u000a"Shri Krishnam Bhaja"\u000a(Todi - Dikshitar) revealed\u000aa very different\u000astory completely in his\u000afavour. With his imaginative\u000aimprovisations,\u000asufficiently supported\u000aby involvement and\u000acomposure, all the contents\u000ashone with dignity\u000aand delicacy.The measured accompanists,\u000aH.K. Narasimha\u000aMurthy (violin),\u000aB. Ravishankar (mridanga)\u000aand B. Shashishankar\u000ain a way buffered\u000athe surging flow of the\u000asprightly singer.* * *Nrithya Saptaha organised\u000aby Nrithyagiri\u000aAcademy of Performing\u000aArts and Research Centre,\u000ain association with\u000athe Department of Kannada\u000aand Culture, is focusing\u000aits activities on\u000agiving preferences to\u000ayoung artistes. A sevenday\u000aprogramme treated\u000athe spectators with interesting\u000aperformances.Badri Divya Bhushan\u000aand Anjana started\u000atheir recital with a\u000aPushpanjali progressing\u000ainto a more serious\u000anumber, a Daru of\u000aMuthayya Bhagavathar,\u000a"Mathe Malayadhwaja"\u000a(Khamach).The senior artistes\u000awhile devotedly portrayed\u000athe Divine Mother\u000anarrated the story of\u000aMadhurai Meenakshi.\u000aExploring the structure\u000aof the composition and\u000aits meaning, they impressively\u000aexecuted\u000ajathis with scholarship\u000aand imagination.\u000aRelevant postures\u000awhich were executed\u000awith ease proved their\u000acompetence at all levels.\u000aYet, more stress on\u000amatters of achieving\u000adeep stances, fully\u000adrawn vinyasas, quickness\u000ain adavus and\u000acrispness in teermanas\u000aincluding arudhis,\u000awould have made the\u000aperformance, more\u000acomplete.The cynosure of the\u000ashow was the young Kumari\u000aRadhika, enlivening\u000athe role of Krishna\u000ain Purandaradasa's\u000a"Kadagola Taarenna\u000aChinnave" (Yaman).\u000aHer expressions and\u000amovements denoted\u000aher inherent zest and\u000aartistry on the way to\u000amaturity. Ramesh Chadaga\u000a(vocal), Chethan\u000aHebbar (nattuvanga),\u000aNarayan (violin) and\u000aHanumantharaju (mridanga)\u000aaccompanied\u000athe dancers.
