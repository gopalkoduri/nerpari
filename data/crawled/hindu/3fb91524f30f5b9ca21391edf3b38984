VThiruvaiyaru B.V. Jayashree, hailing from a family of harikatha exponents, regaled the audience with her soul- stirring performance, at Bala Kala Vidhanam Auditorium under the auspices of Shri Rama Gana Sabha, Tiruchi.As always, Jayashree rendered rare kritis, starting her recital with a varnam in Saveri. Her performance was replete with songs created by composers such as Papanasam Sivan, Dhandapani Desikar, Tyagaraja and Purandaradasa. Her kalpanaswaras were rendered with ease and strong positive energy exuded from her music.Jayashree's mellifluous voice was a treat for the audience who were undeterred by the rains.The accompanying artists, T.H. Vasantha on the violin and S. Rengarajan on the mridangam, added special flavour to the rendition. The concert concluded with a Thiruppugazh in Madhyamavathi and a mangalam.
