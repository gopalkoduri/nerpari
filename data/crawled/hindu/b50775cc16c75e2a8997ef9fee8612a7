VMaster K. Satyanarayana played  Carnatic music on the keyboard  under the auspices of Naadham at Rathna Regent, Coimbatore, where some of his fans had brought their friends along. The organisation brings to light young talent.  Only this time, the ar\u000atiste was young (12  years), but not his talent.Satyanarayana&#8217;s concert was marked by vivacity, speed and vibrant imagination.He commenced his  concert with a varnam in Vasantha and moved on to &#8216;Vara Vallabha Ramanaa&#8217; (Hamsadhwani-GNB). Apt for a Saturday, he sang the Navagraha kriti, &#8216;Diwakara Tanujam, Sanaihcharam&#8217; (Dikshitar) and followed it up with &#8216;Sadhinchane,&#8217; Pancharatna kriti in Arabhi (Tyagaraja).&#8216;Sogasu Jooda Taramaa&#8217; (Kannadagowla) was presented elegantly while &#8216;Kanda Joodumee&#8217; (Vachaspathi) was taken for detailed presentation with adequate alapana, niraval and swarakalpanas.With  an unassuming smile on his lips,  Satyanarayana let his nimble fingers dance on the keyboard pouring out soft, soothing swaras.&#8216;Muruga Muruga Enraal&#8217; (Saveri) by Periyasami Thooran and &#8216;Saarasamukhi&#8217;(Gowda Malhar) by Muthaiah Bhagavatar were right in place before he entered into a leisurely alapana of Thodi for &#8216;Shree Krishnam Bhaja Maanasa&#8217; (Dikshitar).B. Ananthakrishnan on the violin was most supportive and his solos drew wide applause.After this sumptuous feast followed the thani which was nothing short of an ecstatic dance by Kumbakonam Swaminathan on the mridangam and Harihara Subramaniam on the ghatam.After the thillana in Desh, Satyanarayana wound up with &#8216;Ramdhun&#8217; giving his concert a sober, spiritual conclusion.If his skill and &#8216;gnanam&#8217; earned him the admiration of the discerning rasikas, his tender age endeared him to everyone.
