VT.N.S. Krishna's concert in Kochi recently was a fine display of the singer's musical showmanship, discipline and rich legacy. His full-throated timbre and engaging vocals seem to be truly inspired from his father and mentor, Madurai T.N. Seshagopalan.Both his concerts in Kochi were well received. A chamber music concert at Chakkankulangara Siva Temple Oottupura Hall, Thripunithura, in the morning was followed by an evening concert at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Hall (BVB Hall).The concert at the BVB Hall started with the rarely performed Nayaki Ada tala varnam and moved on to a more melodic strain with the Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Sri Raghukula' in Hamsadhwani.The crisp kalpanaswaras made way to a dramatic exposition of Shuba Pantuvarali.The vocalist has an uncanny and striking resemblance to his mentor Seshagopalan's style of singing. Fiery brigas, tightly packed raga phrases and a husky tone bordering on coarseness were unmistakably &#8216;T.N.S.ish.' One only wished that the young musician had a more individualistic style.Right tempo&#8216;Sree Sathyanarayanam,' a Dikshithar composition, shone with the right selection of tempo. The first tempo in swara singing had vakra passages and the vocalist interspersed multiple tempos towards the last phase of this item. Violinist Attukal Balasubramanian loyally followed the vocalist to the finish.After a short sloka rendition, the vocalist presented &#8216;Marivere' in Anandabhairavi. &#8216;Thunai Purindarul,' a brisk song composed by Muthaiyya Bhagavatar in Shudha Hindolam followed.The piece de resistance came in the form of a ragam-taanam-pallavi presented in two ragas &#8211; Kalyani and Lalitha. As Krishna elaborated Kalyani, in the last phase he took up &#8216;sruti bhedam' (scale shift) to Madhyamavati. Yet, more charming than that was the phrase when he returned to Kalyani, merging the shift so unpredictably and aesthetically that it elicited a huge applause from the crowd. The pallavi in Khandajati Triputa was delectable when the vocalist merged lines and phrases in both ragas alternately. When he did this exercise, he stuck mainly to Kalyani, shifting to Lalitha only with the raga mudra. Attukal Balasubramanian found this indeed a challenge and had to be contented with what he could give. The same effect was repeated by the vocalist in the mukthaipu. It was a highly exacting cerebral exercise that was appreciated by a discerning audience.The taniavarthanam was deft and sparkling. Thripunithura Raj Narain correctly picked the finishing phrases from the ghatam player Anil Kumar and thus gave a vibrant rhythmic experience.A rendition of &#8216;Sundariyen swapanathil' in Kamas, a composition by Madurai Sankarasivam, guru of T.N.S came next. The concert ended with a tillana in Hamasanandi.Rasikapriya organised the programme as part of its GNB centenary year and its 34th anniversary.Chamber music concertHis concert in Thripunithura began with Harikeshanalloor Muthaiah Bhagavathar's &#8216;Mana mohana' in Mohanam. This was followed by an abrupt &#8216;Yochana Kamala lochana,' a Tyagaraja composition in Durbar. Experienced mridangist Kangazha Vasudevan Namboothiri kept the tempo of the music right from the beginning.After a virutham of some slokas from the Lalitha Sahasranaamam, Krishna rendered a madhyakaala Keerthanam &#8211; &#8216;Nannu Brovu Lalitha' (Lalitha) from Syama Sastri's &#8216;Meenakshi Navarathnamaalika.' A brief alaap in Khamas revealed his calibre. Muthaiah Bhagavathar's &#8216;Maathe Malayadhwajapaandya Samjaathe' was the kriti.Then Krishna took the popular &#8216;Raamanaatham Bhajeham,' a Dikshitar kriti in Panthuvarali. Krishna rendered &#8216;Saravanabhava' in Pasupathipriya and &#8216;Vaanchha thonu naa,' the only one in Karnaranjini, both composed by Muthaiah Bhagavathar. Adichanalloor M. Anil Kumar and Aattukal Balasubrahmaniam accompanied on the violin and the ghatam respectively.He rendered thanam in two kaalam followed by pallavi with niraval and swara in ragamalika, in Karnaranjini, Pasupathipriya and Niroshta. This was followed by tani. The single thukada &#8211; &#8216;Soundararaajam Aasraye' in Vrindavana Saranga, a composition of Dikshitar &#8211; was followed by the concluding thillana in Hamsanandi. The concert in Thripunithura was organised by Sivasakthi Music Chamber.With inputs from Sivaprasad
