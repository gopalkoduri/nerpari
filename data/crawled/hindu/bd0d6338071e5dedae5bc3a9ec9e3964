VG. SWAMINATHANThe younger generation is adept at balancing several things at the same time. Thus, it was not surprising that N. Harish's pursuit of Carnatic music has not come in the way of  his pursuing  engineering. Harish's voice seems to be at the transition point; his music is fairly mature but his voice is yet to gain weight and volume with the mandatory dash of sugar.In his vocal recital at the Tirumalai Tirupati Devasthanam, Harish attempted  to develop Begada followed by Dharmavati and later Harikhambodi as the main. His  sincerity and commitment to classical music were quite evident in these efforts.  The vocalist's perception and structure of raga exposition could not be faulted and his  open throated articulation deserves to be commended.  "Neevera Kula Dhanamu'' (Tyagaraja) and "Bhajana Seyarada'' (Vasudevachar) were noteworthy.A challengeHarikhambodi is rather tough and it takes experience to tackle it. Harish   did make a good try and rendered the famous "Entara Nitana'' (Tyagaraja) with neraval and swaras at the second charanam "Aagamogthamadu.'' But he could not touch the high points of the raga.Harish's kalpanaswara lines were delivered with confidence  in Lalitha ("Hiranmayeem Lakshmim" by Dikshitar), Dharmavati and Harikhambodi."Ganamurthey'' in Ganamurthy and "Mahalakshmi'' in Madhava Manohari were insertions that came in between.Gokul, the violinist, was commendably comfortable with his strings and bow. His raga responses were cohesive while his kalpanaswaras calculative. Arjun Ganesh on the mridangam padded the programme in just the right measure.Bottom Template Starts
