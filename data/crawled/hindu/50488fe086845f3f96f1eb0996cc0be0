VFULFILLING ITS objective of organising a music recital every month, Visakha Music Academy organised a vocal concert by Maharajapuram Srinivasan of Chennai in Kalabharathi last week. V. V. Srinivasa Rao on violin, Tanjore Kumar on mridangam and Srirangam Kannan on morsing, all from Chennai, lent good support.Rendering of Bhairavi varnam, invocation of Ganapathi Abhishtavarada and Tyagaraja's `pancharatna kriti Jagadanandakaraka' in `Nata' followed by a composition of Purandaradas set to music in `Suddha Dhanyasi', constituted the warming up session that many a connoisseur felt was too long.The preludes of aalapana  were also not so impressive. Rendering the somewhat rarely heard compositions of Tyagaraja, Dinamanivamsa (Harikambhoji) and Raghuveera Ranadheera (Hussaini) both adorned with swaram, however, suddenly breathed life into the concert. `Dayarani Dayarani' (Mohana), embedded with expressive aalapana and swaram, and `Paariyachakama' (Vanaspathi), both compositions of Tyagaraja, followed by Muttaiah Bhagavathar's `Bhuvaneswariya' (Mohanakalyani) were rendered very evocatively and succeeded in keeping the mood created earlier.The piece-de-resistance of the evening was the simple but adept `ragam thanam' and pallavi in Todi concluded with swaram in Raagamalika comprising `Hamsanandi Sivaranjani' and `Shanmukhapriya'.Maharajapuram S. Ganesh Viswanathan not only lent good vocal support but also excelled in his turns in `swaraprastharam'. Srinivasa Rao on violin responded well especially in elaborating the ragas.Kumar and Kannan, besides providing able support, rendered an aesthetic `thani' that marked a grand finale of ragam, thanam and pallavi.A.
