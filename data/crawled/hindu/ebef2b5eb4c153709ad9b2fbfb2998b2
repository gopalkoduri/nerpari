VRAGA ANANDABHAIRAVI (Mysore Sadasivarao's "Poolu Chellave") marked the inaugural concert by S. Shankar followed by "Sakethanagara-Natha" in raga Kambhoji, a Bidaram Krishnappa's composition, in Bidaram Rama Mandira, Mysore. Selections of other vaggeyakars like Mysore Chowdaiah ("Prasanna Sitarama" in raga Thodi and "Sharanu Sharanu Shabarinatha" on Lord Aiyyappa in raga Shankarabharana) "Dasharati Ninnu Kori" of Bidaram in raga Rishabhapriya were impressive. Delineation of raga Abheri ("Sri Kamakoti Peetastithe") of Mysore Sadasivarayaru with neraval and swara kalpana highlighted the artiste's sublime  approach to music. Lucidity of sahitya and svarakalpana with variegated "gathi-bedas" were the significant features.ExhilaratingThe inspiring raga Poorvi Kalyani by Radha Thandaveswar was another instance of classicism. Trained under the gurukula of maestros such as Papanasan Sivan,  and M.D. Ramanathan, the artiste gave an exhilarating performance. The rare composition in raga Hari Khambhoji (Bidaram Krishnappa's swarajithe)  and the melodious sanchari of raga Saveri (Chowdaih's "Devi Sri Chamundeswari") were well-articulated in vilambakala, which reminded one of her late guru, M.D. Ramanathan.  Charulatha Ramanujam on violin, Dr. Guruduth on mridanga and Dasappa on morsing gave excellent support.B.S.S. RAOBottom Template Starts
