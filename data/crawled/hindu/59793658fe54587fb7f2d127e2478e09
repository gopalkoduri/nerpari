VA relaxed interactive mood  pervaded the hall at the Musiri Chamber concert featuring eminent Hindustani exponent, violinist N. Rajam. Performing in Chennai after a long hiatus, the artiste paid homage to the memory of her guru, Musiri Subramania Iye\u000ar in her recital held at his residence.She  prefaced the pieces played, with concise explanations. Firm strokes etched the vilambit khayal in Yaman, with the landing point on the twelfth matra, the emphasis gradually moving from shadja to gandhar to pancham. A palpable vibrancy powered the vadi-samvadi links and weighty double oscillations in the gamaks. Sturdy creepers tapered to delicate tendrils, illustrating the importance of juxtaposing tonal contrasts and shades of expression.Sensitive nuances added tender moments to the lively gait of the madhya lay, with one-off touches lending flair to the tarana that culminated at the tarasthayi gandhar with elan. Reinforced with punch-lines, the select display of taans made an impact that stemmed as much from facile rhythmic flow as from cogent melodic progression.The artiste responded  to the organiser&#8217;s request by playing a kriti learnt from Musiri &#8212; &#8216;Seethapathe&#8217; (Khamas, Tyagaraja)  ranked among the great vidwan&#8217;s favourite compositions. For rasikas, the distinctive patanthara was flavoured with nostalgia. In the popular bhajan, &#8216;Payo Ji Maine,&#8217; insightful improvisations dipped into melody reserves. A lovely prelude in Desh prepared the ground for a serenely luminous chota khayal suffused with tenderness that touched a chord in every listener. Her deep perception shed lustre on the familiar strains of Bhairavi &#8212; that well-spring of creativity. The sprightly air of the bhajan set toes tapping to an irresistible beat even as languorous jarus and inward seeking exploration launched receptive minds on the path of reflection.The sense of musical well-being communicated by Rajam was greatly complemented by Ravindra Yavagal&#8217;s tabla accompaniment which displayed unruffled poise, equally at home in feather-touch flurries highlighting khayal as well as in permutations buttressing kriti.
