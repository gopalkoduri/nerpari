VVijay Narayan, a young vocalist in his teens,  from the U.S., delivered an impressive recital at the 14th NRI Music and Dance festival of Hamsadhwani on  December 30. He had, for accompaniment, Karaikal Venkatasubramanian playing the violin and Thillaisthanam Suriyanarayanan the mrdangam. Trained at  the T.K. Rangachari school of classical music by Ashwin Bhogendra, Vijay exuded a spirit of enthusiasm and confidence. Starting with the unfailing &#8216;Viriboni&#8217; varnam in Bhairavi, Ata talam,Vijay brought in commendable bhava.The presentation of &#8216;Teradeeyakarada,&#8217; Maharaja Swati Tirunal&#8217;s composition in raga Gowlipantu was crisp and appealing. Vijay presented raga Latangi in a short alapana, covering all the sthayis, with pleasing gamaka and rava, to which his voice seemed suited. He could reach down to the bass panchama quite audibly, an ability which he will do well not to give up. He could benefit by trying to extend his range further down to &#8216;ga&#8217; and perhaps &#8216;sa.&#8217; He rendered Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s  &#8216;Venkataramana, Sri Janakikanta&#8217; in Rupakam with adequate lakshana and tasteful niraval at the charanam lines &#8216;Alarmelmangai Manala.&#8217;Vijay&#8217;s elaboration of raga Thodi  displayed a maturity of treatment beyond his age. The subsequent treatment of the heavy kirtanam of Tyagaraja, &#8216;Koluvamare Gada&#8217; in a double-beat Aditalam did full justice to the profundity and majesty of the creation.The violin was very supportive throughout, and while deliveries from it were more mellow, coming as they did from the seasoned experience of Venkatasubramanian, they were modest and never overreached themselves. Likewise Suriyanarayanan lent the correct kind and level of augmentation that could be of help to the singer.Vijay Narayan patently has abundant potential and has the benefit of excellent patantharam.  However, the exuberance of youth can draw a curtain over some blemishes and cloud the vision. He could eschew &#8216;professional&#8217; mannerisms which take their toll on melodic value, clarity in articulation and perfection of tonal content.
