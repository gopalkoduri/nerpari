VNada SagaramThree audio CD packLalgudi G. Jayaraman and Srimathi BrahmanandamSwathi Soft SolutionsMRP Rs. 450An excellent violin duet concert performed decades ago by Lalgudi Jayaraman and his  sister Srimathi Brahmanandam, has been brought out by Swathi Soft Solutions as a three-pack audio CD. The duo has been accompanied by the legendary Palghat Mani Iyer on the mridangam. Mani Iyer&#8217;s son Palghat Rajamani provides the second mridangam accompaniment.The raga chaya of Sri Ragam gets established with just the rishaba note with which Lalgudi commences the phrase of the melody before embarking on the Karur Devudu Iyer varnam (&#8216;Sami Ninne&#8217;). The obstacle remover Ganesha is invoked with the Muthuswamy Dikshitar composition, &#8216;Sri Maha Ganapathi&#8217; (Gowlai-Misra chapu).Tyagaraja is the chosen composer for the next five songs which follow. &#8216;Brochevarevare&#8217; in Sriranjani,  &#8216;Sarasiruhanana&#8217; (Mukhari, adi) and &#8216;Ide Bhagyamu&#8217; (Kannada, Misra Chapu) come  in majestic style.The first disc comes to a close with the &#8216;Pornasadjam&#8217; song, &#8216;Lavanya Rama.&#8217;  In this recital, &#8216;Koniyadatharama&#8217; (Vakulabharanam, Adi) is played without the raga sounding like a mixture of Mayamalavagowla and Thodi.&#8216;Bhairavi&#8217; is the raga offered on a wide canvas preceding the crisp thanam and the intricate pallavi in misra rupakam.  Ragamalika swaras in the lullaby raga, &#8216;Nilambari,&#8217; and the raga of dawn &#8216;Bowli&#8217; are followed by solfa passages in &#8216;Bahudari&#8217; (with a gopucham ending), Kuntalavarali, Ranjani and Hindolam.  A Thirupugazh in ragamalika and a tillana in Behag are the final numbers of this  enjoyable concert.
