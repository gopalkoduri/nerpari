VSangeetha Janakulam, which recently celebrated its Kulapathi I.V.L. Sastry&#8217;s Sahasra Chandra Darsanotsavam, organised his vocal recital at Kalabharathi last Thursday. His daughters (noted vocalists) Saraswathi Vidyardhi and Sarada Subrahmanyam assisted him rendering the lyrical part and Swarakalpana alternately. Agrade staff artistes of local Akashvani studios, M. Srinivasa Narasimha Murty on violin, V.V. Ramana Murty on mridangam and freelancer G. Venkatesh playing morsing lent grandeur. Octogenarian Sastry got himself warmed up starting withSiddhivinayakmof Dikshitar adorned with brief but beautiful ragam and swaram. Similar were the rendition of P. Doraiswamy&#8217;sSariseeruhasanapriya(Naata) suffixed with swaram in the two tempos andNanupaalimpaof Tyagaraja prefixed with revealing aalapana.Then he exquisitely elaboratedSambhomahadeva(Pantuvarali) with aalapana, neravu and swaram , evocatively sangKsheerasaagarasayana(Devagandhari) with aalapana and expatiatedPrakkalanilabadi(Kharaharapriya). He made himself and the audience feel elated. His manodharma by way of aalapana, neravu and swaram turned out to be an empathic treat. Narasimhamurty on violin, Ramanamurty on mridangam and Venkatesh on morsing, while following and playing their turns proved to be eruditely invigorating and complementing. Scholarly thani by Ramanamurty contributed splendour.Rendering ofRaaragopalaof Kotturthi Bhaskara Rao set to evocative music in Anandabhairavi in taalamalika by himself, constituted the grand finale.A.R.S
