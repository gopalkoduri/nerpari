VThe raga vistharams were exercises in musical, intellectual and manodharmic capacities - all delectable-that amply vouched for his approach and attitude. Bindumalini, virtually rests on a solitary specimen song (&#8216;Entha Muddho,&#8217; Tyagarajar), has a handful of typical prayogas and imposes many grammatical restrictions (vakra sancharas).Sashank&#8217;s perceptive genius was in full play as he conceived many a masterstroke to embellish this raga, and the thanam that followed.It is a feat of sorts that he is able to switch flutes unobtrusively to work a mesmerising influence on the listener, which really speaks of his professional competence - the manner of blowing that is consciously adjusted to suit the size of the instrument with a fathomless yet natural sruthi-knowledge.The kriti, &#8216;Neebhakthi Baagyasudha&#8217; (Tyagarajar-Jayamanohari) has two beautifully positioned lyrical points, at &#8216;Boosurulai Janinchina&#8217; (Anupallavi) and &#8216;Nadhaprameyasadha&#8217; (Charanam), from which an aesthetic return to the pallavi in a single stroke would choke one with ecstasy and the artistes rendered these with a fine sense of proportion and delicacy. Earlier the varnam (Khambodi-Ada talam) saw the pallavi being rendered in two speeds, followed by the charanam together with the individual swaras in two ultra-speeds with distinguishable and disciplined kalapramanams. (Padmavathy Ananthagoplan, a veteran on the veena and a revered guru, made special mention of this.) The ad infinitum swaraprastharams for the songs were at places stretched beyond the maximum and only had the unintended effect of camouflaging the kriti.Akkarai Subbulakshmi&#8217;s accompanying style presented polished and nuanced replies to the flautist&#8217;s imaginative flights and her mandhara sthayi bowing for the thanam and the alapana for Jayamanohari, especially in the lower octaves, could be picked up as beguiling instances that clinched your undivided attention. Satish Kumar on the mridangam accompanied keeping a tight rein on himself with adaptive virtues during the songs and gave a thani with laudable rounds replete with compact korvais.
