VShri Shivaratri Deshikendra Swamiji inaugurated the festival, which was presidedby the noted musician Vidyabhushana.On this occasion, the Foundation released two books &#8220;Apoorva Krithimanjari&#8221; (a collection of rare compositions) and &#8220;Shruthimanjari Rasaprashne&#8221; (quiz).Vidyabhushana&#8217;s concert was the first of the series. Mysore M. Nagaraj (violin), H.L. Shivashankaraswamy (mridanga) and H.L. Anantha Krishna (ghata) accompanied the singer. An outright averment that he instantly mesmerises the audience, automatically sets aside any attempt at redundant descriptions as to the quality of his voice or the style of his singing.Thematically, submission to the Lord dominated the concert. Centred on this the artiste sent strong signals of bhakti and vairagya.He began with Vasudevachar&#8217;s &#8220;Lambodaram avalambe&#8221; (Kamboji). A spontaneous rapport between the lead artiste and the accompanists &#8212; mutual recognition and reflex reciprocation &#8212; began to take shape from the very beginning itself. Consequently, neraval at &#8220;Surabhusura Samsevitha&#8221; and the passages of swarakalpana rose to scholarly heights.Similarly, he capaciously expanded &#8220;Shringara pura&#8221; (&#8220;Palisemma muddu Sharade&#8221;-Purandaradasa), copiously accommodating the element of devotion. That the essence of the lyrics find utmost prominence in his recitals, by virtue of great emphasis he lays on diction and phonetic values, is widely recognised.Moreover, the artiste wisely opts for a majestic laya for a stately progression, and convincingly materialises his vision. So the presentations manifest in their full glory to which the mind obediently submits, without further ado. All these features were sufficient to qualify the recital as sublime. Yet, considering his precedents, in this instance, the learned artiste could not transport listeners to an ineffable subliminal state.Picking up the positive thread: unbounded absorbing competence affirmed itself in &#8220;Dasanamadiko enna&#8221; (Purandaradasa) sung in Todi. Musical and sentimental eloquence prevailed over any circumlocution in interpreting Thodi.The singer selected Purandaradasa&#8217;s Ugabhoga - &#8220;Dasanaguvudakke esu janma&#8221; - to develop the raga in its substantive entirety.The selection also served as an appropriate overture to the main lyrics, and the passing shades of dramatic mattu (a distinct singing style) evoked a welcome feel of nostalgia. A neraval at &#8220;Bhava bhaya duhkava bidiso&#8221; enhanced the mood hitherto created, and judiciously added strains of kalpanaswaras fortified it.
