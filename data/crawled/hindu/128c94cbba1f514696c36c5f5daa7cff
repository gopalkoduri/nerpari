VThe Karnataka Sangeeta Nritya Academy, Bangalore, celebrated the Dr. V. Doreswamy Iyengar Memorial Mysore Traditional Veena Utsav recently, with a series of lecture demonstrations and concerts by senior as well as upcoming artistes, over a three-day period, highlighting the vibrant veena tradition of Mysore and a wide range of associated topics.The second day of the Festival began with a session on the Karaikudi bani by Shankar Raman, who mentioned that the most celebrated exponents of the style were the brothers Subbarama Iyer and Sambasiva Iyer, representing a family tradition that originated 400 years ago.It was explained that while Subbarama Iyer held the instrument in the vertical or oordhwa position, Sambasiva Iyer favoured the horizontal one, and that mastery was achieved through total dedication, and relentless practice that stretched to 14 hours a day. The speaker stressed that the brothers played to elevate the audience to aesthetic and spiritual heights, and not to display their own prowess, using only about thirty compositions, from a vast repertoire, in their concerts.The distinguishing features of the Karaikudi style were also elucidated, a strong meettu being one of them, and the chittaswara composed by Sambasiva Iyer for Veena Kuppaier's &#8220;Namoralakinchi&#8221; in Dhanyasi raga and rupaka tala demonstrated.Manjula Surendra next made a power point presentation on the life and music of the legendary V. Doreswamy Iyengar.His early life and tutelage under Mysore Venkatagiriappa, and his illustrious career as performing artiste and composer were illustrated, exemplifying the best of the Mysore tradition, a fine distillation and perfect blend of the gayaki style and vadya dharma.While some major concerts of the maestro and a few of the innumerable awards bestowed on him were enumerated, a display of photographs and selections from recordings attested to the painstaking research undertaken by the speaker.The appreciation and opinions of fellow musicians were also quoted, with perhaps the artiste's qualities being summed up best in the words of Pandit Ravishankar, who extolled his &#8220;simplicity in life and superiority in music&#8221;.A veena concert by Revathy Sadashivam, ably accompanied by M.R. Sainath (mridanga) and T.N. Ramesh (ghata) followed. Commencing with Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar's &#8220;Sri Mahaganapathim&#8221; in Athana raga and adi thala, and &#8220;Parithapamu&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in Manohari, the artiste took up Lathangi for a well contoured and melodious alapana. The ensuing composition, Mysore Vasudevacharya's &#8220;Entha Nirdaya&#8221;, was embellished with a crisp neraval and kalpana swaras, constituting the best structured item of the recital.Deekshithar's Navagraha krithi &#8220;Divakara Thanujam&#8221; in Yadukulakamboji and Thyagaraja's &#8220;Manavyalkimcharadate&#8221; in Nalinakanthi prefaced a compact but bhava laden elaboration of Saveri, and an expert thanam, revealing a soft but firm touch and sound technical grounding, suffixed with Mysore Sadasiva Rao's &#8220;Sri Kamakotipeetasthithe&#8221;, and fluent kalpana swaras culminating in a tani avarthana.The scope and diversity of the subjects dealt with during the festival, supplemented with a number of live concerts, ensured that the Utsav was both educative and enjoyable, effectively highlighting the attributes and contributions of the veena tradition of Mysore .
