VThe album contains Jawaharlal Nehru&#8217;s &#8220;tryst with destiny&#8221; as well as Rajiv Gandhi&#8217;s words on &#8220;Vision of Modern India&#8221;.For today&#8217;s younger generation, the freedom struggle and the building of India as a sovereign nation in the 20th Century is a piece of nebulous history &#8212; too close in time to be well documented in the history textbooks, and too far back f\u000aor them to have personal experiences related to the period. But even for those whose parents were involved in the independence movement and who grew up in the new India, forgetfulness comes easily, it would seem.So for all of us who think of 15th August as noting more than a reprieve from work and school, Sa Re Ga Ma India has come out with a two-CD pack, &#8220;Voices of Freedom&#8221;, with some of the most significant speeches and songs of modern India&#8217;s history, starting with Jawaharlal Nehru&#8217;s &#8220;tryst with destiny&#8221; address and going on till Rajiv Gandhi&#8217;s words on &#8220;Vision of Modern India&#8221;. Between the grandfather and the grandson we hear the voice of poet Rabindranath Tagore, of M.S. Subbulakshmi singing &#8220;Vaishnav Jan To&#8221;, as well as a popular song of the times like &#8220;Sabarmati ke Sant&#8221; from the film &#8220;Jagriti&#8221;.There is also Subhash Chandra Bose&#8217;s rousing call to the Indians of East Asia, asking them to join him in an armed struggle against the British, besides B.R. Ambedkar&#8217;s speech to the constituent assembly. In between are other famous songs such as &#8220;Kadam Kadam Badhaye Jaa&#8221; sung by the Calcutta Youth Choir and &#8220;Sare Jahaan se Achchha&#8221; sung by Lata Mangeshkar with music by Pandit Ravi Shankar. They remind us of the irreplaceable role of musicians in forming and expressing the spirit of a nation.The entire album is strung together with commentary by the one man perhaps most fitted to put all the disparate elements of India into lucid perspective &#8212; Karan Singh, a man of letters and of the arts, at home in royal India and in democratic India, and, above all, a patriot.Nationalism and patriotism are not traits typically associated with Indians anymore, it would seem. This album then, is a gift for all of us in India&#8217;s sixth decade of independence.Voices of FreedomSaregamaRs.450
