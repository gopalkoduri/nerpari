VThe  festival by recipients of the Sangeet Natak Akademi&#8217;s Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar-2007  was given a befitting start by Bhimanna Yadav, who played raga Yaman on the rare wind instrument sundri. It  sounded much like the auspicious mangal vadya shehnai, immortalised by Bismillah Khan himself. Sandip Harish Deshmukh was the other artiste of the inaugural evening, who sang raga Bageshri in the latter half.Among the rest of the music performances, the melodious sarangi recital next day by Sarvar Hussain,  gifted disciple and grandson of the late Lateef Khan, cast a magic spell by his mature treatment of the challenging and rare raga Shrutivardhini. His amazing skill and tender sensibility, especially during the slow Jhoomra composition&#8217;s difficult gamak taans, the delightful handling of the twin Madhyams or creating the illusion of raga Marwa while adhering to the grammatical constraints of the main raga, through the moorchhana of teevra Madhyam, could be attributed to his thorough grounding under his legendary guru. Mesmerising the audience with two lovely compositions in the main raga, Sarvar concluded his recital with a traditional hori in raga Mishra Kafi. Nafis Ahmad on the tabla and Javed Khan on the sarangi gave him the  desired support.Earlier Meeta Pandit opened the evening with raga Puria Dhanashri, rendering the bada khayal &#8220;Ab to rutama&#8230;&#8221; set to slow Ek tala, followed by a chhota khayal in Teen tala. Her tappa in raga Tilang  sounded rather like a chota khayal set to addha theka. The tappa intricacies were more visible in Mehmood Dhaulpuri&#8217;s harmonium. Meeta concluded her recital with her own composition based on raga Pahadi.The Punjabi Academy offered a feast of Punjabi compositions, both traditional and classical. The festival opened with raga Kamod by the Patiala gharana&#8217;s young duo Jawaad and Mazhar Ali Khan, the grandsons of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, and ended with  Javed Bashir of Pakistan, who sang the Sufiana compositions of Punjab in a much lighter vein. Some compositions of Shah Sadarang and Adarang, the famous creators of the Khayal genre, were also rendered by renowned artistes.Yashpal from Chandigarh offered not only a rich repertoire of excellent bandishes but also the authentic flavour of Agra gaayaki. He is one of the senior most disciples of the great stalwarts of the Agra gharana like Vilayat Hussain Khan,  Yunus Hussain Khan, Sharafat Hussain and Latafat Hussain Khan. He opened with his own composition in raga Kafi Kanhara set to slow Ek tala &#8220;Aave dilajaani&#8230;.&#8221; which had the inimitable nuance of the intricate tappa ang  right from the mukhra (the opening phrase). The Teen tala composition &#8220;Tandari yaad sataave&#8230;..&#8221; was also his own creation. He went on to sing exquisite compositions in numerous ragas like Jog, Malkauns, Kedar, and Darbari before concluding his impressive performance with raga Sohni. Vinay Mishra on the harmonium, Bharat  Bhushan Goswami on the sarangi and Anoop Kumar on the tabla gave him inspired accompaniment.The other veteran singer was Bhimsen Sharma, whose opening sadara in raga Puria had the traditional Dhrupad ang of Punjab. His erudite comments  during his masterly performance were a source of precious knowledge one gets only from the old gurus.
