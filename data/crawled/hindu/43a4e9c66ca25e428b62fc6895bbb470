VGoethe Zentrum in association with Swaranjali organised a duet of Hindustani classical music to launch a new musical instrument, Jaywant Guitar. The backdrop was a banyan tree that was lit around the courtyard. Jaywant Naidu on the Hawaiian guitar, Saskia Rao De Hass on the cello and Satyajit Talwalkar on the tabla performed.Sasika has also trained in the Hinudstani system. Both the artistes play Hindustani music on western instruments. That's the reason why Jaywant modified his instrumentby adding sympathetic strings to generate resonance, needed  for Hindustani classical music.The program began with an alaap in Raga Yaman with both artistes laying emphasis on the Nishad and Gandhar swaras.Then there was a composition in Raga Yaman in Madhyalaya Teental followed by a fast paced Jhala in Teentaal. Then they took up a short Alaap in Raga Jog with a composition in Drut Teental and a dialogue format play on guitar and tabla. This was followed by the launch of Jaywant Guitar, a modified format that suits the Hindustani style by Amita Desai of Goethe Zentrum and Saskia Rao De Hass. Jaywant says that he used three pairs of strings as main strings on the Hawaiian Steel Guitar. There are also three Chikari strings and 12 Taraf strings, totalling the number of strings to 21.
