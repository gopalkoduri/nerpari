VSadguru Sri Thyagaraja Aradhana Sangeethotsavam, organised every year in Vijayawada by Sangeeta Sanmandali as a festival to pay tributes to the saint composer, was successfully conducted this year from January 23 to 30 at Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao Government College of Music and Dance, and it evoked good response from music lovers.The event was sublime and exquisite, as the renditions brought more soul to music and the musicians never attempted to impress upon the listeners with any gimmick.The festival began with a function presided over by Sangeeta Sanmandali president Pemmaraju Surya Rao, attended by Swarajhari president T.S. Ramachandra Rao as chief guest with noted flautist Prapancham Seetharam lighting the lamp. On the second day, music lovers participated in Nagara Sankeerthana carrying the idols of Thyagaraja and Anjaneya Swami, passing through some streets and singing a few keertanas to re-enact &#8216;Oonchavrithi' that the saint followed.During the week-long festival, at least 150 vocalists and accompanying artists, most of whom were budding ones, paid tributes to the saint by singing his keertanas in the morning and evening sessions. Following the age-old tradition, Sangeeta Sanmandali did not pay them any expenses for travel or any honorarium to perform, and it was entirely a voluntary affair.The highlight of the festival was the group rendition of Pancharatna Kritis, the five jewels of Thyagaraja, on the last day. The singing flowed like a gentle breeze. The vocalists enthralled the music lovers with their finely blended voices, singing in tandem. The pieces and rendition of ragas and swaraas had a pleasant style of classicism satisfying the common folk as well as elite listeners as the presentation was mellow, disciplined and coherent.The event started off on a lively note with Sri Ganapathini&#8230; in Sourashtram and was followed by the well-known composition of Thyagaraja, Jagadanandakaraka&#8230; in Naata raaga. The singers created a devotional atmosphere all through their recital, sharing the applause equally. And finally it was Thyagaraja's ever popular Endaro mahaanubhaavulooo...in Sri raga, which they embellished with a pleasing performance. The instrumentalists &#8212; violin, mridangam, ghatam, morsing and veena &#8212; provided excellent support in this concert and contributed significantly.Divinity engulfed the precincts of the college, where the programme was organised, with musicians, sporting silk robes, walked in. A large number of budding musicians participated in the festival.
