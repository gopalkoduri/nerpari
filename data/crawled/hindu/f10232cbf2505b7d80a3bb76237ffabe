VUnder the auspices of the Cultural Activities Centre of Seethalakshmi Ramaswamy College, (SRC), Tiruchi, Visakha Hari, presented a musical discourse on &#8216;Prahalada Charitham.&#8217;Visakha Hari in her unique style blended exquisite music with recitations from Indian classics and contemporary concepts in her discourse. She expounded the legendary story as suggesting concrete solutions to the problems of present day life highlighting the values to be cultivated by an ideal person.She said that strong belief, an undaunted mind, devotion to God, concern for fellow beings, respect for others, fearlessness and truthfulness, are the values of Prahalada, a boy of hardly five years that made him a great achiever.Visakha  insisted that students must imbibe the courage of Prahalada to face the problems of life and shed suicidal tendencies.Exposing the students to the esoteric aesthetic experiences resulting from listening to the traditional &#8216;Harikatha Kalakshebam,&#8217; she gave an insight into the rich cultural heritage of our land.Madhwa Prasad on the mridangam and Govindarajan on the violin rendered able support. G. Kalyani, principal, SRC, presided.The students were greatly impressed by the discourse.
