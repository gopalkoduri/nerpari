VThe three-day Sree Rama Navami Music Festival at Kalpathy, organised  by Sree Rama Navami Celebrations Committee, began with a pleasing vocal recital by Lakshmi Ananthakrishnan.  She stuck to the traditional concert pattern, with a fine selection of songs.After the opening varnam &#8216;Samidayajuta&#8217; of Tiruvattiyur Thyagayyar in Kedaragoula, she proceeded to render quite a few compositions on Rama, starting with &#8216;Deva Devam Bhaje Divya Prabhavam&#8217; in Hindolam, an Annamacharya kriti.The tempo was sustained with graceful portrayals of &#8216;Rama nannu brovara,&#8217; composed by Tyagaraja in Harikambodhi and &#8216;Kalyanarama&#8217; in Hamsanaadham, composed by Uthukkadu Venkatakavi.The soothing traits of Sahaana were missing in the alapana, but the raga swaroopa emerged clearly in the swaraprasthras rendered at the end of the kriti &#8216;Jaya Jaya Raghu Rama&#8217; by Swati Tirunal.Poochi Srinivasa Ayyangar&#8217;s &#8216;Neekelanayeta&#8217; was an apt choice before the main item &#8216;Rama Rama gunaseema,&#8217; a Swati kriti in Simmendramadhyamam. The raga was well depicted, with the right proportion of &#8216;akaras.&#8217; The plethora of sangatis in the neraval at &#8216;Munimaanasa&#8217; and the well-woven garland of kalpana swaras showcased her  manodharma.&#8216;Naamam nalla namam&#8217; in Valaji, describing the efficacy of Rama Naama, and &#8216;Bhajare Hanumantham,&#8217; a ragamaalika song in Madhuvanthi, Revathi and Sri, in praise of Anjaneya, were presented with bhava. &#8216;Mamava pattabhirama,&#8217; a Dikshitar masterpiece in Manirangu, and &#8216;Naraharideva Janardhana&#8217; in Yamunakalyani had instant appeal.Koduntharapally Subbaraman lent able accompaniment on the violin. His sketches of Sahaana and Simmendramadhyamam were rich in tonal nuances. Palakkad Ganesan displayed maturity in his handling of the mridangam. His crisp and crystal clear strokes won the admiration of the audience. Young Deepu impressed with his fine display on the ghatam.Shertallai Ranganatha Sarma has blossomed as a complete musician, over the years. With his resonant voice, acute sense of sahitya and profound manodharma, he has carved an unique style that evokes  nostalgic memories of the late maestro Voleti Venkateswarulu.In his concert on the second day of the festival, he established an excellent rapport with the listeners right from the opening pieces, &#8216;Deva Deva Kalayami&#8230;,&#8217; a Swati composition in Mayamaalavagoula, and &#8216;Bhajamaanasa Vighneswaramanisam,&#8217; a Thulasivanam kriti in Bahudhari. He captured the quintessence of Reethigowla in his brief alapana and rendered the Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Cheraraavathe mira Ramayya.&#8217;After a brisk &#8216;Bhogindra Saayinam&#8217; in Kuntalavaraali, again a composition by Swati Tirunal, he painted a neat picture of Pantuvaraali. He chose &#8216;Ennagaanu Ramabhajana,&#8217; a soulful song of Bhadrachala Ramadas popularised by M.S.Subbulakshmi.While the phrasings in the neraval at &#8216;Premamira Bhadradri&#8217; revealed his sense of kaalapramana, the swaraprastharas centred around &#8216;Shadjam,&#8217; highlighted  his ingeniousness. The serene beauty of Devagandhari was well projected in the raga delineation and interpretation of the less-heard Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Kshithija Ramanam.&#8217;After a spirited rendition of &#8216;Chinnanaatena,&#8217; a Tyagaraja kriti in the rare raga Kalanidhi, Sarma embarked on Thodi for an in-depth treatment of the raga. He built a grand edifice of the raga, crowning it with chiselled sangatis and karvais. The melody was further embellished with an enchanting niraval and comprehensive swaraprastharas at &#8216;Sri Karuniki&#8217; in the Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Koluvamaregadha.&#8217;The concluding session saw the vocalist rendering  &#8216;Tungateera Virajam&#8217; in Chalakabhairavi and Ahirbhairav, Swati Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Bhaja bhaja maanasa&#8217; in Sindhubhairavi and Sadasiva Brahmendra&#8217;s &#8216;Pibare Ramarasam&#8217; in Ahirbhairav.Edapally Ajith showcased his prowess in his fingering and bowing. Manoj Siva provided wonderful support on the mridangam.Anuradha Krishnamurthy, daughter of the renowned vidwan K.V.Narayanaswamy, was featured on the third and last day of the festival. She began well with the majestic Swati Ada tala varnam  &#8216;Sarasijanabha&#8217; in Kambhodhi, followed by a Dikshitar composition &#8216;Panchamatanga&#8217;  in Malahari and Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Sri&#8217; raga pancharatna kriti &#8216;Entaro mahanubhavulu.&#8217; Next came the alapana of Kuntalavaraali, elaborated in detail.&#8216;Bhogindra Sayinam&#8217; was rendered with gusto, appended by kalpanaswaras.The portrayal of Panthuvaraali was strictly on traditional lines, with the raga bhava emerging clearly. Tyagaraja&#8217;s popular kriti &#8216;Appa Rama bhakti,&#8217; in which the saint composer dwells at length about the significance of &#8216;Rama bhakthi,&#8217; was essayed nicely, evoking  the mood of the kriti. The interesting niraval and the vivid swaraprastharas at the anupallavi &#8216;Trippatalanu&#8217; were enjoyable.Arunachalakavirayar&#8217;s &#8216;Raman Ezhuntharulinan&#8217; in Anandhabharavi was a prelude to the lucid exposition of Dharmavathi, taken up for ragam, thaanam and pallavi. The raga was elaborated with subtle gamakas and sangatis in the alapana and thaanam. The four &#8216;kalai&#8217; pallavi, &#8216;Raghukulanandana Rama Sita manohara Sri&#8217; in Adi tala was executed with precision and confidence. The ragamalika swaras in Hindolam, Valaji and Revagupthi were appealing.Towards the end, she sang &#8216;Avataaram Seithiduveere&#8217; in Jonpuri, &#8216;Janakiramana&#8217; in Kaapi and the tillana &#8216;Niri niri gama garisa&#8217; in Poorvi, a favourite of KVN. A little more grace and refinement in presentation would have lent greater weight to her renderings.Violinist Neyveli Radhakrishnan gave adequate support. Shertallai Ananthakrishnan (mridangam) and Kovai Suresh (ghatam) performed as an ideal percussion duo. Their tani made a good impact.
