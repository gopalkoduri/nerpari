VThe 198th birth anniversary of Maharaja Swati Tirunal, perhaps the greatest of composers of Carnatic and Hindustani music from Kerala, was celebrated in style by the Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha, Thripunithura.This is the first time that the sabha has organised such an event to mark the day, which, as per the Malayalam calendar, falls on the star sign of &#8216;Chothi' (hence Swati) in the month of &#8216;Medam.' On the occasion, classical musician Aswathi Tirunal Rama Varma, scion of the erstwhile royal family of Travancore, was invited to pay tribute to his illustrious ancestor. Rama Varma gave a delightful lecture-demonstration on the royal composer and it was liberally interspersed with Swati kritis.Golden ageThe vocalist began by pointing out that not only were the 18th and 19th centuries the golden age of Carnatic music when Swati and the Trinity (Tyagara, Dikshitar, Syama Sastri) and many others composed their magic, but it was also the golden age of Western classical music, the period of greats such as Mozart and Beethoven.He lamented that except for the works of Swati and the Trinity, it is unfortunate that in Carnatic music we only have some lyrics and not the original compositions of the quartet's contemporaries such as Papanasam Sivan. And because of this, what we know as works of these geniuses have actually been tuned by later artistes.Varma also explained the significance of Swati's mudra &#8216;Padmanabha' as the &#8216;dasa' (devotee) of Lord Padmanabha of the Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple in Thiruvanathapuram &#8211; the family deity of the erstwhile royal family of Travancore.Varma sang &#8216;Sarasijanabha,' a Kamboji varnam, and proceeded to explain the beauty of Swati Tirunal's varnams. He followed it with a less-popular kriti &#8216;Saadhu thadaa nija bhaaminee' in Vakulabharanam from &#8216;Kuchelopakhyanam.' The swaraprastharam added here was attractive. Varma also gave a fascinating explanation of how Swati was inspired to compose this kriti.The alaap of the Hindustani raga Behag was easy to follow, even for the uninitiated, because of the stresses that the vocalist gave to the swarasthanams. Being a raga that can be sung in both Carnatic and Hindustani, Swati contributed many a composition in Behag in both styles. The padam &#8216;Smarajanaka subhacharitha' was rendered elaborately. Here too, Varma's swaras were excellent.Main ragaThe main raga of the day was Simhendramadhyamam. Edappally Ajith followed the vocalist well on the violin throughout the concert, especially during the alaap of the main raga. For this, Rama Varma sang a rare krithi, &#8216;Rama Rama Gunaseema Sita Rama Rama.' Nanjil Arul performed a sole tani on the mridangam, after a marvelous swaraprastharam.Rama Varma's thukkadaas impressed the rasikas at the packed auditorium. An inspiring alaap of Neelambari was followed by the padam &#8216;Kaatharaakshi thaanthayaayi maruvunnen tharuneemani.' &#8216;Aaj aaye Syam Mohan' in Yamuna Kalyani, and the mangalam &#8216;Bhujagasaayino' (Yadukulakamboji), were also excellently rendered.
