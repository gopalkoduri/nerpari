VOne of the most iconic photographs in the history of rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll is the one where the young Beatles, clad in pyjama kurtas and flower garlands around their necks, are sitting cross-legged with the transcendental guru, Mahesh Yogi, at hi\u000as ashram in Rishikesh in 1968. It was a turbulent period of their lives, but the outcome was far from it. That&#8217;s when and where the seeds for the White Album were sown.The White Album, which is celebrating its 40 birthday, is one of the most significant pieces of music in the history of the band as well as rock music. It was a period when things started on a happy note in the idyllic Rishikesh ashram where the Fab Four spent hours meditating, wandering around, meeting kindred souls and of course, writing some of their best songs.That the disillusionment set in when they went into the Abbey Road recording studio in England and constant fights erupted among  the band members, signalling the beginning of the end, is history now.Many of the songs in  the album have a direct link to the ashram days, while reflecting the tumultuous social changes in  the 1960s. &#8216;Dear Prudence&#8217; is about actor Mia Farrow&#8217;s sister, who was holed up in her room spending marathon sessions meditating. &#8216;The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill&#8217; refers to some visiting Americans who went on a tiger hunt (some feel it is a comment on the Vietnam War). &#8216;Mother Nature&#8217;s Son&#8217; was inspired by the surroundings of the ashram.On the personal front, John Lennon was slowly succumbing to the charms and ideas of budding avant garde artist Yoko Ono. In fact, all John&#8217;s numbers in the album are intensely personal. If &#8216;I am So Tired&#8217; was a statement on his grappling with meditation, &#8216;Julia&#8217; was an ode to his mother and &#8216;Everybody&#8217;s Got Something to Hide&#8217; was about Yoko.As for George Harrison, he was discovering and immersing himself in all things Indian, especially the philosophy. The result? The ballad &#8216;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&#8217; and &#8216;Long, Long, Long.&#8217;Paul McCartney was at his best at pastiche in songs such as  the rocking tribute to the Beach Boys and Chuck Berry &#8216;Back In The USSR&#8217;, the big band jazz &#8216;Martha My Dear&#8217; (Martha was his dog), and the country and Western ballad &#8216;Rocky Raccoon.&#8217;Though Ringo Starr was most concerned about the cuisine (he could not digest the ashram cooking and ordered special food from abroad), he still found inspiration to compose his first ever song to feature in a Beatles album, &#8216;Don&#8217;t Pass Me By&#8217;!The White Album (initially christened &#8216;The Beatles&#8217; but known popularly as the White Album thanks to the stark white jacket) is the most diverse mix of styles and in a way, a statement of the music that was to come in the years to come.Almost like a prophetic vision! From the heavy metal of &#8216;Helter Skelter&#8217; to the psychedelic rock of &#8216;Happiness is a Warm Gun&#8217;; from reggae beats of &#8216;Ob-la-di Ob-la-da&#8217; to the experimental sound collage &#8216;Revolution No. 9&#8217;, this is an album that simply breaks down every definition of what the band had stood for till then.The album is still celebrated by fans and critics alike. The White Album is the band&#8217;s bestseller till  date and one of the world&#8217;s top 10 best-selling rock albums of all time. It was also ranked No. 10 by Rolling Stone when it compiled a list of the 500 top rock albums of the world. In fact, there were reports that filmmaker Mira Nair wanted to make a documentary on The Beatles&#8217; days in Rishikesh.Forty years on, the White Album stands testimony to the magical genius of four boys from Liverpool, who conquered the world as The Beatles!
