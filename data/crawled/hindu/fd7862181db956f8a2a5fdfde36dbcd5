VThe Music Forum featured a lecture-demonstration by  Vidya Shankar at Raga Sudha hall. With each point-specific illustration testifying to her awesome command over precept and practice, her vidwat ensuring that the twain did meet, the senior musician\u000a held forth with authority, candidness and humility on the subject, &#8216;Sruthi Anantham.&#8217;Indeed, the only concession made to age, a venerable 90 years, was that the artist was seated on a chair with the veena on a bench before her.Mention the topic, &#8216;The 22 Sruthis and their Values&#8217; and you&#8217;ll likely evoke a groan of protest from music students preparing for Carnatic music theory examinations. Vastly easier to grasp through practical experience, it is not the easiest of concepts to comprehend through the written word.Had even a clutch of these students been present at this lec-dem, they would have had many of their doubts cleared. However, only a small but genuinely interested group of rasikas chose to seek enlightenment. Comparing the seven notes SRGMPDN to the seven colours of the rainbow, the artist explained that notes, like colours, are imbued with myriad shades. A note can be handled plaintively, approached from a lower or higher note and holds scope for infinite variations.The same note merits different treatment in profiles of different ragas. For instance, the gamakas given to chatusruthi rishabha vary in Sankarabharanam and in Kalyani. Again, in Madhyamavathi, the gamaka differs, being a gentle oscillation, evident in the word &#8216;Paavani&#8217; (&#8216;Paalinchu Kamakshi,&#8217; Syama Shastri).No lecture on sruti values is complete without a mention of the gandhara in Varali. Technically sadharana gandhara, but inextricably allied with the chatusruthi rishabha. Esoteric, handled with care by vocalists and instrumentalists. &#8220;Raise it a little higher and you compromise its identity. It cannot be explained, only experienced.&#8221;&#8220;The Antara gandhara is regarded as Swayambu, the purest note. Tune the tanpura perfectly and you can hear it.&#8221;It occurs in both Anandabhairavi and Ritigowla but assumes a higher sruti value in the latter, distinguishable in the signature phrase &#8216;GGM.&#8217;It is a powerful characteristic plain note in Sankarabharanam and Yadukulakhambodi, but raised a little higher in Mayamalavagowla and even higher in Kalyani. &#8220;Students must be trained right from the &#8216;alankaram&#8217; stage to distinguish and handle variations. Specific notes in a raga are given importance (pradhanam) such as the suddha madhyama in Bhairavi. Likewise, the Begada &#8216;ma&#8217; has so many hues! Varnams are wonderful compositional forms that highlight these subtleties. The prati madhyama is known as the Varali &#8216;ma.&#8217; It closely abuts the panchama and differs from the Kalyani &#8216;ma.&#8217; Coming to suddha dhaivatha, Tyagaraja has composed about 30 kritis in Thodi alone, each illustrating facets.&#8221;Kaisiki nishadha is called &#8216;the septimal seventh.&#8217; Great composers evoke different bhavas from the same note in a composition.In Syama Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Sariyevvaramma&#8217; (Bhairavi) the &#8216;Ni&#8217; in &#8216;Amba Nee&#8217; is elevated to emphasis the status of the goddess. But in the same line, the &#8216;Ni&#8217; in &#8216;Sri Kamakshi Nee&#8217; is lowered to denote karuna inherent in &#8216;Daya Joodavamma.&#8217; The Kakali nishadha in Kalyani ideally proceeds from the shadja above it. In Sankarabharanam it merits a different approach.In summation, the artist spoke of the correlation between music and mathematics, reiterating that art and science go hand in hand. She also answered rasikas&#8217; queries relating to Trisruthi values, the handling of gamakas in vivadi and Hindustani ragas and the introduction of western instruments into the Carnatic soundscape, dwelling upon the veena&#8217;s potential for replicating vocal gamakas.
