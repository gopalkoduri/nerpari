VThe band comprises Vishal Mehta on drums, Neelranjan on guitar, Sovon on tabla, swapnamay on sarod, manish on keyboard and rajesh on fluteIt was an evening to celebrate India&#8217;s 60 years of independence. They did it rightly through a fusion music concert. Fusion is, after all, a melange of different sensibilities that brings together the old and the new traditions. And India can b\u000ae defined in similar words as well.Holding the centre stage was Delhi&#8217;s Sky Group of Sovon Hazra at Stein auditorium. Founded by Sovon Hazra, a disciple of Pandit Vishvanath Bose, Jayant Bose and Kumar Bose of the Benaras gharana, the band comprises instruments like tabla, sarod, keyboard, Hawaiian guitar, flute and acoustic drums.Ten compositions, each evoking a different emotion, marked the event that lasted just over an hour. The chief guest Lieutenant-Governor Tejendra Khanna honoured the artistes and spoke a few words about the need to create harmony.The first composition of the evening was in memory of those soldiers who laid their lives for the country. Swapnamay Banjeree on sarod took the lead in this short piece titled &#8220;Arpan&#8221;, and was joined by Rajesh Prassnya on the mellifluous flute and Sovon on the tabla.Through their next composition the group paid their respect to the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, whose birth anniversary fell on that day.With Manish Babu on the keyboard, Neelranjan Mukherji on the guitar, along with flute and guitar, the composition was in raga Bhairavi.The keyboard notes created magic, as the drum, played by Vishal Mehta, and tabla joined in for a fast-paced rhythm in this composition that lived up to its name &#8211; &#8220;Passion&#8221;. The sarod, the guitar and flute was a soothing contrast to the high beats in raga Keeravani.&#8220;Anandam&#8221;, composed by Neel, celebrated the sense of achievement, while &#8220;In search of&#8230;&#8221; took you on a long ride to a world that is beyond comprehension.The beautiful strings of sarod with its mystic sound in raga Keervani stir your soul, and the solo play by both flute and keyboard amplified the mood.Have you even been to the deserts? Do you know what it is like to walk in the sand? Tuned in raga Basant Mukhari, the mid-paced guitar and tabla showed you how it would feel. &#8220;Nurture your soul&#8221; reached out to your heart in raga Jogkauns, which started off with guitar and keyboard, was followed by &#8220;Illusion&#8221;. Shovon left his tabla for an African Cajon in this piece, as guitar and drums played the accompanist.The &#8220;Tunes of India&#8221;, was specially made-to-order for the occasion. Different folk tunes blended with classical ragas in this tune as the rhythm flowed smoothly to make it foot tapping.Though each and every composition was a treat to listen to, a true fusion concert is when all the instruments on the stage blends with each other and at the same time get its share of space.Except for the Hawaaiin guitar, which left an impression, the tabla, sarod and the flute were clearly the major sounds, leaving the keyboard and drums to play the second fiddle.
