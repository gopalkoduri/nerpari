VNo sooner did the Kerala-based youngster start singing than he conquered hearts with his music deeply rooted in classicism.The supporting artistes, all Delhi-based, soon connected with him and their enthusiastic participation further enhanced the delight of the audience. Vechoor C. Sankar, an A-graded artiste of All-India Radio, presented a memorable recital the other day at the Ishta Siddhi Vinayaka Temple, Mayur Vihar Phase III. The concert was organised by the Sri Adi Sankara Sewa Samajam as part of the Mandala puja celebrations.CreativityAfter the opening varnam, Shankar's invocation song on Lord Vinayaka was Muttuswami Dikshitar's &#8220;Vatapi Ganapatim&#8221; in raga Hamsadhwani. The swaraprastaras that flowed towards the end of the composition pointed to his creative talents.Sankar took up Mysore Vasudevachar's &#8220;Bhajare re manasa&#8221; in raga Abheri and Papanasam Sivan's &#8220;Saravanabhava yenum&#8221; in Shanmukhapriya for detailed presentation.The alapana of both the ragas was done in stages bringing their features to the fore. The kalapramanam (tempo) for the former slow-paced song in Adi tala was solid. In the latter song, creativity flowed during the improvisation techniques.Sankar took up the opening phrase &#8220;Saravanabhava yenum tiru mandiram&#8221; for neraval and followed it with swaraprastaras.Earlier, Sankar presented Tyagaraja's &#8220;Needayarada&#8221; in the raga Vasanta Bhairavi and a composition of Maha Vaidyanatha Iyer, &#8220;Pahimam Sree Rajarajeshwari&#8221; in raga Janaranjani.Sankar brought out the emotive aspects in the former composition to the fore. The latter song, a fast paced one, kept the proceedings lively. Clarity of sangitis, especially during the bhriga usage, was another noteworthy feature here.Sankar was accompanied by VSK Chakrapani on the violin, K.N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam and K. Ramamurthy on the ghatam. Chakrapani's delineation of ragas Abheri and Shanmukhapriya was delightful.The percussionists' understanding support, especially during the slow paced composition in Adi tala (2 kalai, a particularly slow tempo), was very impressive. Their tani avartanam (percussion solo) in Adi tala too was enjoyable.BhajansAt Sree Subha Siddhi Vinayaka Temple, Mayur Vihar Phase I, Shenkottai SKS Harihara Subramania Bhagavathar too presented a memorable bhajan programme.The highlight of his bhajan was the scintillating ragamalika virutam in more than a dozen ragas in quick succession, which included Shanmukhapriya, Sankarabharanam, Bhairavi, Mohanam, Sahana, Hamsanandi, Darbar, Nayaki, Brindavana Saranga and Saveri. Endowed with a good voice and trained in classical Carnatic music, Harihara Subramanian, in his programme, presented virutams, songs in praise of various deities and namavalis to the utter delight of the audience.At the neighbouring Noida too, the Delhi-based Bala Gokulam group delighted devotees with their Ayyappa Bhajan during the Sasthapreeti celebrations organised by the Vedic Prachar Sansthan and Noida Hariharaputra Samajam, this past weekend.CorrectionIn an earlier review of the concert of Ranjani and Gayathri at Malai Mandir, the composition &#8220;Orarumugane&#8221; in the raga Reeti Gowla has been inadvertently attributed to Periyasami Tooran. The composer of this song is Neelakanta Sivan.
