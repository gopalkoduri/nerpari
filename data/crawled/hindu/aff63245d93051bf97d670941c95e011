VPrashanth N.R. (at Ganabharathi)\u000afirmly adhering\u000ato the\u000atraditional aspects\u000awould not admit of any\u000akind of compromise, which\u000awould undermine the established\u000anorms: manodharma\u000aexpands freely\u000awithin the chaukattu laid\u000adown by teachers of high\u000aacumen.Smitha (violin) and H.L.\u000aShivashankara Swamy\u000a(mridanga) accompanied\u000athe singer: their scholarly\u000acontribution perfectly\u000amatching with the singer's\u000amode and method.Stable voice, gracefully\u000atraversing the octaves, is\u000aendowed with such a magisterial\u000atone that draws\u000aimmediate attention and\u000acommands respect. The\u000ageneral tempo, falling between\u000apleasing vilamba and\u000ainvigorating madhya layas,\u000amade it congenial for enjoying\u000athe finer aspects of\u000amusic.Not casually treating the\u000avarna "Viriboni" (Bhairavi -\u000aatta taala) as a warming-up\u000aexercise, the knowledgeable\u000aartiste rightly presented\u000ait as an exceptional piece\u000aof scholarly magnitude.Rendering both the\u000apoorvanga and the uttaranga\u000ain two speeds, (subjecting\u000aeven the ethugade\u000aswaras to such orderly pattern),\u000ahe laid bare all the\u000aten gamakas (Kohala), ingeniously\u000aincorporated into\u000athe varna by\u000aPachimirium Adiappayya.\u000aIn some areas, the akaaras\u000atook the form of naabhi\u000athanas, remaining undistorted\u000aeven in the taara\u000asancharas."Karikalabha Mukham"\u000a(Saveri-Dikshitar), "O Rajivaksha"\u000a(Arabhi-Thyagaraja)\u000aand "Brovu Brovu"\u000a(Keeravani - composer not\u000aclear: with some discrepancy\u000ain the beginning and the\u000aend of the alapana) outshone\u000athe varna in matters\u000aof fervour, grandeur and\u000aexperience.In R.K. Padmanabha (Veena - Shri Thyagaraja Sangeetha\u000aSabha and Ganakala\u000aParishath), one may mark a\u000afine blend of virtuosity and\u000acreativity, and of the two,\u000aideally the latter shines\u000abrighter, and that glow illuminates\u000athe compositions,\u000amesmerising the\u000aaudience.Kumarswamy (mridanga)\u000aand S. Manjunath (ghata)\u000areadily fulfilled all the\u000aneeds of the Vainika's manodharma\u000aleading to a\u000agrand success.The instrument, which\u000aPadmanabh played, was a\u000aKanaka-Rajatha-Akhanda-\u000aSaraswathi Veena, inherited\u000afrom his father, the luminary\u000aR.S.\u000aKeshavamurthy, to whom\u000athis was given to by Bakshi\u000aVeena Subbanna. It is\u000adecked with consecrated\u000a(Agamoktha) images of\u000aGoddesses Saraswati, Chamundeswari,\u000aNagaraja and\u000aKrishna, thus transforming\u000ait into a sacred shrine of\u000adivine music.Concert started with\u000a"Ninnu Kori" (Varna - Mohana\u000a- Ramanathapuram\u000aShrinivasa Iyengar). By simultaneously\u000aresonating\u000adifferent strings and notes,\u000ahe drew forth veera and\u000aadbhuta rasas, the nature of\u000athe construction demanded.Ranjani (Ranjani Niranjani\u000a- GNB) had exemplary\u000aacademic flavour: variety of\u000agraces, including long, swift\u000aglides and soft curly movements,\u000anurtured the emotional\u000acontents in this\u000alyrics-oriented work. Further,\u000ain Dikshitar's "Anandeshwarena",\u000afeathery\u000atouches to distinct, fine articulations\u000acharacteristic of\u000aAnandabhairavi, fostering\u000asublime lyrics, elevated the\u000aaudience to contemplative\u000aheights.Raga-thaana-pallavi\u000a(Charukeshi) was the finest.Technically, it was an exquisite\u000ainterpretation\u000aflashing wafts of melodic\u000aairs (only tripping occasionally).\u000aCreativity reigning,\u000aelaboration of lyrics\u000a("Neerajakshi Janani") was\u000apacked with emotion.Ghanapanchaka Ragas\u000aformed fine matrix for developing\u000athe swarakalpana\u000afeaturing smooth transitions."Visweshwara Darushan"\u000a(Sindhubhairavi -\u000aSwathi Tirunal) and "Odibarayya"\u000awere other interesting\u000ainclusions.
