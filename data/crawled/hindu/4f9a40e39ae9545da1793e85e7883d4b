It was amazing that the singer of thetarangamwas a 70-year-old man whose voice was sonorous and tuneful. With his powerful voice and perfectlayasense, G. S. K. Sampat Kumar of Hyderabad enthralled the audience for more than two hours. He rendered several populartarangamsof Narayana Teertha handling the traditional brasstalamswith differentlaya vinyasfor which the tarangams give scope. The programme was a great treat for lovers of traditional and unadulterated cultural forms.Sampath Kumar rendered thetarangamsfrom Narayana Teertha&#8217;s great Sanskrit work, Srikrishna Leela Tarangini,  giving in between the gist of the songs. He renderedJaya Jaya Swamin,Saranambhava(Arabhi),Krishnam Kalaya Sakhi(Mukhari),Kalaye Yasoda(Surati),Balagopala Tarangam(Mohana),Pooraya Mamakamam(Bilahari),Vedadri Sikhara(Kambhoji) and several other populartarangams.
