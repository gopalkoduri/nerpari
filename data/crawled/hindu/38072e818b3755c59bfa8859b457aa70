VThe nine-day programme will feature hymns extolling Goddesses Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswathi.  The event will be aired daily from 6.30 p.m. It is neither a live telecast nor a public performance. So what do the celebrities think about it?Aruna Sairam- TV programmes always have a reach and millions will be  viewing this on all the nine days. This will  elevate us and remind us of the richness of our tradition and culture and how intact it is. It is truly an act of reinforcement and reinvention. I was really caught by the ambience.Playback singersMahathiandSaindhavihave made their contributions too. Mahathi has included a fine piece on Mahakali and Saindhavi a rare kriti of Papanasam Sivan.And for the Airtel super singers, Deepthi, Aparna and Dhanyashree, they have been provided a platform which would  take them further.Sharada Nambi Aaruraan, known for her devotional discourses, will speak about all the famous temples and the Goddesses touching upon  the significance of celebrating Navaratri.
