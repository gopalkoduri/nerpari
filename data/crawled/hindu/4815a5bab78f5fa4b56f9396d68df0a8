VCelebrating old cine melodies, music-lovers and singers joined together under the stewardship of keyboard player, V. Seetha Ramaiah and presented a programme of rendering select songs from Hindi and Telugu movies of yesteryears (1950-67).Held at Kalabharathi, the programme had Seetha Ramaiah and John on the keyboards, A.V. S. R. Prasad on the guitar, Raja and Anand on tablas, and Rangaji with rhythms. Besides noted singer of Ghantasala songs, Y.R. Sastry, who was felicitated on the occasion, the band of singers included Dr. Ramnarayan, Peter, Bhaskar, R.V. V. S. Narayana, S. Narayana, Ramkrishna, Sasirani, Sailaja, Suhasini Anand, Usha, Jayalakshmi and Dr. Mukundakumari.Saaguma Sahini(Swapnasundari),Hridayama Saagipomma(Paropakaram),Naapriya Kuteeravatika(Vaddante Dabbu), andJoruga Husharuga(Bharyabharthalu) were some of the choices in Telugu.Awaaz De Kahan Hai(Anmol Ghadi, ),Hawame Udtha Jaye(Barsat, ),Rasikabalama(Chori Chori) and the like figured in the Hindi list.The conspicuous deficiency in the orchestra was that it was limited to only two keyboards and did not cooperate too well with the sound amplification system. However, notwithstanding these drawbacks, the programme overall reflected enough reminiscences of the glory of music in the old movies.Suhasini Anand poetically compered the programme.
