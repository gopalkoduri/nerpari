VDuring the inauguration, P.R.Vittel (son of late P.N. Raghavendra Rao) shared his  memories with the audience recalling the days when his grandfather Mysore Vaidhyar Srinivasa Rao and his friends conducted this aradhana.  He reminisced that violin maestro Chowdaiah used to come every year from Mysore and M.L.Vasanthakumari&#8217;s used to be the first evening&#8217;s concert.This year&#8217;s aradhana made a different beginning with &#8216;Laya Lahari,&#8217; a percussion ensemble consisting of 12  musical instruments, presented by Ayyanar College of Music, Bangalore. M.K.Pranesh (flute), Pushpa Kashinath (veena) and S.Yashaswi (violin) were  were surrounded by Anoor Dattatreya Sharma (mridangam), A.V.Kashinath (kanjira), R.Sathyakumar (ghatam), Tirumala Srinivas (maddalam), Manjunath (rhythm pad), B.Dhruvaraj (pakhwaj), Ravi Kumar (dolu), Srinivasa Murthy (morsing) and Anoor Anantha Krishna Sharma (tabla).The concert began with the varnam in Begada, the veena, venu and violin providing the basic melody for the laya. After a brief delineation of Hamsadhwani, they played &#8216;Gajavadanaa, Beduve&#8217;. During the lively swarakalpana phase, the percussion artistes joined by turns, letting the audience enjoy the different combinations. Next came the much-loved Pancharatna kirtana of Tyagraja in Sriragam, &#8216;Endharo Mahanubhavulu,&#8217; followed by &#8216;Narayana Ninna&#8217; (Suddha Dhanyasi).After these initial delicacies came the  wholesome treat, the ragam, tanam, pallavi in Sankarabharanam. The enchanting flute, the bewitching veena and the caressing violin vied with each other during the raga delineation and the tanam presentation. Then the pallavi, &#8216;Purandara Gurum Namami Sathatham, Tyagaraja Vandithaya&#8217; (set to Adi talam) was presented at various speeds, appropriately offering respects to the Sangita Pitamaha. The &#8216;thani avartanam&#8217; that followed the RTP  lasted 45  minutes.The nine percussionists formed three groups. Mridangam, kanjira and ghatam formed one group. Tabla, dolu and rhythm pad formed the second and maddalam, pakhwaj and morsing formed the third group. There were enough opportunities for each vidwan to bring out his best.  It was obvious that quite a lot of research had gone into this programme as they had experimented with different groups and settled for the most pleasing combinations.Director Anoor Anantha Krishna Sharma and Ravi Kumar also presented konnakkol which became the highlight of the show.  Soon after,  all the instruments came together in a crescendo, showering a unique blend of melody and rhythm, sending waves of thrill among those present. One could not help thinking of the scene from Sivaji Ganesan&#8217;s &#8216;Tiruvilaiyadal&#8217; for the song &#8216;Pattum Nane, Bhavamum Nane&#8217;.Songs like &#8216;Jagadhodharana&#8217; and &#8216;Tamburi Meetidhava&#8217; had many from the audience singing along with the main artistes. Bombay Sisters and N.Vijay Siva sang on the second and final day, respectively.
