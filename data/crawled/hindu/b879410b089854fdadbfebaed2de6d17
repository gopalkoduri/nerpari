VOne thousand mindsVeena SahasrabuddheHindustani classical - AbatonBook CompanyPrice not mentionedVeena Sahasrabuddhe, one of the outstanding contemporary exponents of the Hindustani classical discipline, is the daughter and `chela' of Pandit Shankar Sripad Bodas, who in turn was the disciple of the great Pt. Vishnu Digamber Paluskar, whose deeply religious approach to music emphasised his conviction that music was the easiest and surest path to God realisation.Veena's rigid, sustained training, nightingale-like voice, an acute musical acumen and lifetime dedication to the art, have placed her in the upper echelons of North Indian music. The programme unfolds with a silken tonal expansion of raag Kalavati in different speeds and the various octaves.The solfa efforts and the lighting tans in the tarana section are engulfed by a halo because of the perfect, graceful, effortless singing and the amazing adherence to sruti.The rhythm for the lyrics is set in vilambit ek taal. Veena's detailed interpretation of raag Shree is shepherded with utmost care, initially with absolutely melodic, heavenly phrases, simple yet strikingly beautiful, bearing the testament that the artiste belongs to a glorious inspired lineage that inspires listeners to burst into song. The tailpiece, "Vande Mataram," with its unparalleled lyrics of Bankim Chandra Chaterjee, showcases Veena Sahasrabuddhe as a musician with a mission.Melting bhajansDivyadhwani Audio  -   devotional  -   Bhakti Sudha  -   Seetha Narayanan  -   CD SNBH 09.The divine compositions of saint poets such as Brahmanand, Meera Bai, Kabir Das, Surdas and others are acme of bhakti, filling the soul, senses and spirit of both the scholar and the laity.
