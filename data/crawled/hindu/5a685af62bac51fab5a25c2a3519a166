VA. SANGAMESWARANKalikkota, a cultural organisation dedicated to the propagation of classical art forms, was inaugurated at Muvattupuzha recently. Veteran violinist M. Chandrasekharan lit a traditional lamp and blessed the organisation with his solo violin recital.Chandrasekharan is a much sought-after violinist and has  accompanied many titans.The selection of Mohanam varnam as the inaugural concert was appropriate as it is one of the first varnans that is taught to students of Carnatic music. Chandrasekharan has the ability to simultaneously sing thesahithyawhile playing the instrument, which makes it pleasing for  those who have not heard the kriti earlier.A pleasant Revagupthi (`Gopalakapaahimam') and a melodious Kapi (`Sumasaayaka') followed next. Both these evoked memories of KVN who had immortalised these Swati kritis. It was a Chandrasekharan's tribute to  KVN, whom he had accompanied many a time.Main ragaA fast `Varanarada' in Vijayasree gave the necessary pep to the detailed, well-structuredalapanaof Kappinarayani, the main raga for the evening and the Tyagaraja piece `Sarasa saamadhaana,' eulogizing the statesmanship of Lord Rama. Thrissur Narendran accompanied on the mridamgam. His accompaniment for the Revagupthi and Kaapi pieces  was simply superb.Bottom Template Starts
