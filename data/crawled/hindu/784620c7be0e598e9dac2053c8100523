VT.K.GANAPATHYPerfect alignment to sruti, thorough grasp and internalisation of grammar and creativity characterised the inaugural vocal recital of Trichur Ramachandran at the Sree Ramanavami celebrations at R.S.Puram, Coimbatore. Creativity within the prescribed limits was in evidence throughout the concert. The opening `Vanajakshi' varnam in Kalyani sung with bhava and raga swarupa, followed by `Vathapi Ganapathim' (Hamsadhwani) embellished with swaras, and the succeeding number, `Sujanajeevana' in Khamas were majestic renderings. The Subhapanthuvarali alapana was an elaborate but succinct sketch with customary and fresh musical phrasings preceding Tygaraja's composition, `Ne Pogade Kunte,' and the presentation had kalpanaswaras flowing with élan.The soothing flow of `Lavanya Rama' was earworthy. The raga vinyasam of Hindolam with its measured phrases and bhava-laden glides as a prelude to `Deva Devam Bhaje' had silken strands to lift the listener to dizzy heights.The niraval and swaras flowed with felicity eliciting appropriate response from the violinist. The raga essay of Kharaharapriya was noteworthy for its exquisite interplay of karvais, madhyamakala sancharas and depth. The kriti, `Chakkaniraja' itself was sung marked by nobility.`Adi Kadu Bhaja Manasa,' a rare piece of Tyagaraja in Yadukulakhambodi was soaked in devotion. Sundareswaran (violin) showcased his artistry in his raga sketches of Hindolam, Kharaharpariya and swara repartees. Mali's telling rhythmic support on the mridangam with the refined percussive gentleness of Purushothaman on the ghatam heightened the dignity of the kutcheri.Free rein to vocal cordsSriram Gangadharan  gave free rein to his vocal cords in his recital at the Sree Ramanavami celebrations in R.S.Puram. His recalcitrant voice, although rich in immensity and aggressive expression, could not bring out the charm of the  melodious music in the numbers he had chosen for the kutcheri. The opening piece, `Maha Ganapathim' in Nattai with swaras was at breakneck speed. `Nandagopalakrishnam' (Panthuvarali) and `Brochevarevarura' in Khamas were passable. Sensitive artistry was missing in his depiction of the raga contours of Sruthiranjani for the kriti, `Edari Sancharinthura' and Thodi for the song, `Thaamadamen Swami.'The saving grace was the violin support of Satish Kumar. Madipakkam Suresh was the mridangist.Bhavani Kishore's good musical sense came to the fore in his vocal recital especially in the opening `Chalamela' varnam and `Merusamana' (Mayamalavagowlai) rendered with swaras. The presentation of the kritis, `Neethichakra' and `Jagadanandakaraka' showed disciplined smoothness and vigour.`Intha Saukhyamu' in Kapi was at a relaxed pace to reflect the song's intense appeal. He exhibited his manodharma through a compact delineation of the raga for the kriti, `Vandanamu'.Guruvayurappan's violin accompaniment was mellow. Radhakrishnan (mridangam) and Jagannathan (morsing) gave percussion support. The young vocalist, who shows promise, should pay attention to gana-naya in his exposition of the songs.Bottom Template Starts
