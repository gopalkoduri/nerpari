VThe Veena Foundation in association with the Indira Gandhi National Foundation for Performing Arts and several city sabhas organised Veena Navarathri, a series of nine concerts by highly accomplished veena artists, who have fine-tuned their art to co\u000ammendable levels.The aim of this festival was to draw the veena as solo instrument into main-stream concert music and to revive dwindling audience interest.Among the artistes featured was S. Srinivasan, a disciple of the late vidushi Rajeshwari Padmanabhan, doyenne of the Karaikkudi style.A brief clutch of traditional pidis defined a sketch of Begada followed by Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Vallabha Nayakasya&#8217; and kalpanaswaras highlighted by emphatic gamakas. A leisurely &#8216;Amba Nilayathakshi&#8217; (Nilambari) was steeped in tranquillity and gentle flavour. Resonant mandara sthayi prayogas added rich tones and depth to a Saveri alapana etched with discipline within a well-defined grid. Bhava-intact kizhkala swaras and brisk melkala swaras augmented the Syama Sastri kriti &#8216;Shankari Shankuru.&#8217; An apt contrast breezed in with Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Padame Gathi Paramasiva&#8217; in Valaj. Rithigowla which can always be counted on to take a concert to empathetic heights constituted the main piece.The artist&#8217;s sensitive portrayal of the raga coaxed weighty gamakas, smooth jarus and winsome sancharas in three octaves from the strings. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Dwaithamu Sukhama,&#8217; rich in bhava, was embellished with kalpana swaras that were in consonance with the spirit of the composition.Sherthalai Ananthakrishnan&#8217;s mridangam and T.V. Vasan&#8217;s ghatam playing reiterated that subtlety is their forte as they encouraged and complemented the main artist&#8217;s efforts.
