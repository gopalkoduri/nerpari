VThe tiny village of Mansur, where the celebrated musical maestro, the late Pandit MallikarjunMansur born and brought up reverberated with Hindustani classical music on Saturday.The New Year dawned to melodic rendition of vachana gayana and music of the jaltarang, thanks to a special music programme held at the ancestral house of late Mansur as part of the National Music Festival organised in connection with his centenary celebrations. It was a rare opportunity for the residents of this remote village to enjoy the Hindustani classical music that was taken to sublime heights by the &#8216;son of their soil'. The whole village turned up in enthusiasm even as the best of the classical music world visited their village to pay respects to the legend. Two musical concerts of one hour each enthralled the audience. Vocalist D. Kumar Das presented popular vachanas of Basavanna. His rendition was a grand fusion of devotion and melody. The second concert, a jaltarang-violin jugalbandi, was a feast for music lovers. Jaltarang player Shashikala Dani and the accomplished violin player Vadiraj Nimbargi engaged in a creative dialogue. They were accompanied on the tabla by Uday Kulkarni.
