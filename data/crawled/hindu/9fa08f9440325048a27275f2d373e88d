VSudha Ragunathan, who adorned the stage on the first day of the 39th annual celebration of Ragapriya, Madurai, began the concert with a Nalinakanti varnam.  Her rendering of the short alapanas and kritis was well appreciated by her die-hard fans. Her selections included &#8216;Re Re Manasa Bajare&#8217; in Nattai by Sengalvaraya Sastri and &#8216;Mokshamu Galada&#8217; in Saramathi, which she began with &#8216;Sakshathkaranee.&#8217; She was supported by K.Bhaskar on the violin and Skanda Subramanyam on the mridangam.No one noticed the passage of time as Neyveli  Santhanagopalan launched into long drawn alapanas in Hamsadhwani and Dhenuka, further enlivened by the skilful play of the violin  by V.V.Ravi. The singer had earlier sung a variety of chittaiswarams for the ata tala varnam &#8216;Viribhoni,&#8217; followed by an interesting interpretation of &#8216;Vatapi Ganapatim.&#8217;The highly accomplished singer&#8217;s unique sense of rhythm was put to good use in the Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi in the raga Ranjani. The thani avarthanam by Umayal  Mali and Raja Ganesh on the ganjira needs special mention.Maharajapuram S. Ramachandran sang many familiar ragas such as Saranga (&#8216;Karunimpa&#8217;), Mohanam, (&#8216;Bhuvaneshwariye&#8217;) Ananda Bhairavi (&#8216;Kumara Jananee&#8217;) and Sankarabharanam (&#8216;Manasu Karuniniki&#8217;).His rendering of Subha Panthuvarali in long resonating notes for the song &#8216;Narayana&#8217; was soaked in devotion. The tone of Nagai Muralidharan&#8217;s violin matched the deep throated singer&#8217;s voice.The second half of the concert had some brisk renditions of favourites such as &#8216;Akilandeshwari&#8217; in Dvijavanthi and &#8216;Vilayada Idhu Nerama.&#8217; He was ably supported by Salem K. Srinivasan on the mridangam.In contrast, Sanjay Subramanyam&#8217;s concert picked up pace right from the start. The contrasting tonal variations displayed by the singer fascinated the rasikas in &#8216;Neeke Teliyaka&#8217; in Ananda Bhairavi. He also educated as well as entertained the audience by telling them the names of rare ragas such as Vakulabharanam.The Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi was an exploration of the beauty of Kalyani and was soothing to the ears. The accompanists were S. Varadarajan  (violin), K. Arun Prakash  (mridangam) and Tiruchi V. Mohanram  (gatam).It was a brilliant show when two stars, Lalgudi G.J.R.Krishnan and Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi ascended the stage at the same time to provide a double treat for the rasikas. It was hard to believe that two instruments were being wielded on stage &#8211; so uniform was the playing.At the same time, the artists indulged in their creativity in the solo alapanas making the rasikas aware of their individual styles. This synchronisation was observed in the playing of the percussionists too &#8211; Palladam Ravi on the mridangam and V. Mohanram on the gatam. Vijayalakshmi&#8217;s alapana in Sahana contained the right combination of surprise and variety, while Krishnan&#8217;s solo pieces were fine samples of virtuosity and creativity.The audience watched with the thrill of anticipation as the alapanas became duets where one player appeared to challenge the other. This made the concert a novel experience even though the selections were well known kritis such as &#8216;Kapali&#8217; in Mohanam and &#8216;Nee Daya Rada&#8217; in Vasanta Bhairavi.Nithyashree Mahadevan sang rare ragas, such as Kaikavasi and Palahamsa although the main raga that she elaborated on was Bhairavi, which was sung as a prelude to the Dikshitar swarajati, &#8216;Kamakshi.&#8217; She appeared to make an attempt at stylistic variation through voice control, which made her sound more melodious than in her previous concerts.The Ragam Tanam Pallavi was a wonderful display of vocal range and was appreciated for its technical complexity, which entailed singing in a combination of thisra and misra nadai.The liveliness of the show was enhanced by M.A. Krishnasamy on the violin, I. Shivakumar on the mridangam and Rajaganesh on the gatam. The series of concerts was well attended and appreciated by the rasikas in Madurai.
