VKalasagaram presented a vocal recital of young Jayaram last week. Dinakar was on the violin and Arvind on the mridangam. The two-hour concert showed the  artiste&#8217;s competence.A student of PS Narayanaswamy, Jayaram has achieved more than what one can expect at his age, including charm, delicacyand refinement. The process of presentation is natural. Thrill may be missing but it has elegance. Showmanship, so much needed, unfortunately, is lacking, but  there is no dearth of erudition and confidence. It is constant practice, guidance and application that will make Jayaram an outstanding artist.With a good repertoire, his selection was sensible and the sequence smart. Lack of experience and youthful desire set in some common but yet unnoticeable imbalances. The biggest handicap in Jayaram&#8217;s singing is the limitation of his voice.He sings at an incredibly highsruti, which vulnerably deprives depth; as the concert progresses, the voice becomes weaker and fails to register at theadhara shadja.Hissruti gnanais remarkable but the imbalance inmanodharma sangithamis desolately evident. For instance, the proportion ofalapanawith thekrithis, the differentkalaparamanamsfor the different disciplines,and the regulation of individual sectors need attention.If thealapanaforvaraliwas good, thekrithiof Shyamasastri inmisra chapuwas richly emotional, but lacked intensity. Kamboji (Sri Subramanyayanamasthe) was elaborate, impressive and innovating but thesangathis, including theneravalandswarakalpana, were from the common code.Mamavapattabhi ramainmaniranguwas a rare item and thrilled the audience.The success achieved was mainly due to the excellentsruti gnanamof the artist.The modulation of voice during a concert is not only the contributing factor in a concert, it is also true of the sound of the mridangam and the softness of playing that adds to the nicety of rhythm. Seldom do we see this simple but salient feature adopted by a majority.This is a individual feature in Arvind&#8217;s playing, besides his innovativenadaisand their verities.Histhaniwas excellent. Dinakar on the violin was very helpful with a confident approach.
