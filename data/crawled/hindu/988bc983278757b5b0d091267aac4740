V`Kala Trishna' a newly-launched music sabha in Somajiguda played host to a veena recital by Ayyagari Syamasundaram recently. The concert was well received by a sizeable number of music lovers. He was accompanied by M.L.N. Raju on mridangam Haribabu on ghatam and Sai Giridhar on tabla. The sabha, which was launched by music-loving couple Anuradha and her husband Srinivas has been  organising monthly concerts to encourage classical musicians, especially the young. The veena concert lasted for about two-and-half hours and the audienceincluded some well-known musicians of the city.The concert sounded a bit unconventional in its format but yet was captivating. Unconventional, because Syamasundarm introduced a tabla inhis percussion support and gave a Tani avartanam chance to the percussionists right in the opening composition Vijayambike by Mutthaiah Bhagavathar in Vijayanagari ragam and Aditalam. It was Manodharma Sangeetham all through with a lot of imagination and his trademark meetus and flourishes.  The timbre of the strings he played on was quite perfect, making the concert quite interesting and producing sounds a la guitar.. M.L.N. Raju, who led the Tani avartanam in this opening number was simply superb. Haribabu and Sai Giridhar too lent good support. Shyamsundar presented around a dozen numbers which were all well picked out compositions from works of revered composers. Then, he took up Kalyani for Pankajalochani. Deva devam in Sindhubhairavi, Jo Achyutananda in Kapi of Annamacharya, Nanati Bratuku in Revathi also of Annamacharya and a couple of Kannada compositions concluded his recital.
