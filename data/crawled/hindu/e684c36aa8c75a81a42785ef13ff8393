VThe Vasantha Memorial Trust organised a concert &#8216;Endrendrum MS&#8217; by Amritha Murali some time ago, with a view of invoking &#8216;RAM&#8217; the Subbulakshmi way.Amritha gave her best shot to recall the kritis popularised by MS  so that the audience could enjoy the pleasure of some vintage music.Amritha had the most understanding  partners in Padma Sankar on the violin and B. Sivaraman on the mridangam.They too belong to the present generation who were willing partners in Amritha&#8217;s exercise to create the ambience of bhakti integrated into melody.&#8216;Namo Namo Raghukula&#8217; in Nattai followed by the popular &#8216;Rama Nannu Brovara&#8217; in Harikambodi made the audience look up for more. Amritha&#8217;s voice has gained strength and at the same time, could traverse all segments with ease. Her rendition of these compositions and the swara strings at &#8216;Meppula Kaikanatavu&#8217; in the latter was nostalgic.Varali was taken up for detailing for the Tyagaraja?s composition &#8216;Maragatha Mani Varna Rama.&#8217;The singer sincerely brought the high points of Varali in her exposition and added further lustre with a niraval at &#8216;Dharani Tanayakunna Prema Rasamu&#8217;, appended with a score of well etched swaras.Wasn&#8217;t it bhava that dominated MS&#8217; music? So Amritha served two numbers &#8216;Tsallare Rama&#8217; in Ahiri, soft and slow, and &#8216;Vachama Gocharame&#8217; in Kaikavasi in a slightly faster mode imbued with emotion.The major segment was allotted to Kharaharapriya and a kriti of exceptional quality &#8216;Rama Nee Samanamevaru&#8217; was chosen by Amritha. One could feel her originality had taken over her intention to imitate MS in the raga vinyasa.Therefore, the essay had more of briga-oriented phrases with a few but well defined parts of extended kaarvais. The song came out in all its beauty with a brisk niraval at &#8216;Paluku Paluku&#8217;, dovetailed by intense swaras.Padma Sankar&#8217;s follow up of raga and swaras waas always in tune with the vocalist.B Sivaraman&#8217;s precise thani was impressively conceived.Amritha could have chosen more popular numbers for the two concluding pieces with a prelude of sloka viruttams; her selections here were &#8216;Pibare Rama Rasam&#8217; in Yamunakalyani by Sadasiva Brahmendrar and &#8216;Sri Ramachandra Kripalu&#8217;, a Tulsidas bhajan in Sindhubhairavi.A word for the organisers about the venue, which was a small on terrace;  the listeners had to climb narrow stairs, struggle for seats, brave a variety of insects, bear the stench from a nearby toilet and ignore the intermittent whistles of pressure cookers from neighbouring flats. A better place is warranted.
