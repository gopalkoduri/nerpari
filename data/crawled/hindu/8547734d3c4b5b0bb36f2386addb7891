Raju on the mridangam and Ghantasala Satya Sai on the morsing. Vagesh began his concert withRaghunayakain Hamsadwani, which set the tempo of the concert. TheSwarakalpanawas brief and good.Yagnadhuluin Jayamanohari was another beauty with fastswaramin it. Saramathiragamwas short and sweet and Thyagaraja&#8217;sMokshamuwas sung at its best and the performer  delivered all the intricacies of theragam.The main attraction of the day was Khamboji. Theragamdelineation had all the traditionalsangathisof theragam. He chose to sing ragam-tanam-pallavi. Dwaram on the violin did very well. His Kalavathi and Khamboji elevated the main artiste&#8217;sragam. M.L.N. Raju a well-known mridangam artiste from Vijayawada AIR, showed his class in his accompaniment. Over all it was a good team work and marked the beginning of the fest in style.Vishnu Bhotla sisters &#8212; Saraswathi and Krishnaveni &#8212; from Vijayawada began their concert withNinne Bhajanain Natai of Thyagaraja in a steady tempo with briskswara.Ganamurtheof Thyagaraja was melodious.Oorajhoopuchu chedi nyayamain Kannada Gowla was another running item. Sahana was neatly essayed by Saraswathi and later improvised by Krishnaveni who is also an established violinist andEevasudhanee vanti daivamuof Thygaraja&#8217;s famous number came out neatly.Shobilluin Jaganmohini was a fast number and theKalapramanawas good. Dinakar on the violin came out well with his alert accompaniment.Histhodiwas good. B.V.S. Prasad, husband of Sarsawathi and an AIR artiste has done his job well on the mridangam. Histaniin misrachapu along with Srinivasan on the moresing was a treat to watch. They concluded with adevaranamaand atillana.The acoustics of the day largely disturbed the concert. One wished for a proper sound system.
