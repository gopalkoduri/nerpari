VIt was a music-filled night; one the audience wished would never end. There was pin drop silence as the audience sat throughout the concert, listening to the stream of music.The Museum Auditorium was filled with the sound of music as Julian Clef, Uday Shanker, Carol George and Violin Joy carried the audience on flights of music at the sixth Bach Festival last Saturday. Organised by Clef and Canto Music School, the event witnessed some great performances.Starting off on a good note was Uday Shanker&#8217;s &#8216;Waltz Brilliante&#8217; by Chopin. He was followed by Julian Clef, who touched hearts with his expertise on the piano.If Julian&#8217;s opening piece, Bach&#8217;s &#8216;Prelude and Fungue Nos 1 and 5&#8217; had parallel melodies playing to create a musical melange, C. Debussy&#8217;s Images Book 1 &#8216;Reflects dans l&#8217;eau&#8217; had patches of music joined to create fine music. Prokofiev&#8217;s &#8216;Toccatta Op.1&#8217; saw the pianist gliding his fingers over the piano as he brought to life the simple melody that is rich in technicality.A student of Chetham&#8217;s School of Music, United Kingdom, Julian displayed his skill when he played Chopin&#8217;s &#8216;Etude Op. 10 No. 3 Polonaise in F# minor Op. 44,&#8217; a Polish folk tune. Not only did he traverse the keys with ease as he played the tune, but he also had listeners tapping their feet to its constant rhythmic change.The evening was brightened further with a violin and piano session, as Julian accompanied violinists Carol George and Violin Joy. While Bach&#8217;s &#8216;Air on G string&#8217; by Carol had the audience walking in a cloud of music with its mix of harmony and melody, his solo rendition &#8216;Preludium-1 movement 6th partita 6 sonatas and partitas for solo violin&#8217; by Bach had listeners wanting more from the violinist.And to satiate the listeners came Massent&#8217;s &#8216;Meditation&#8217; from &#8216;Thais&#8221; that had the audience going through a range of emotions. But, it was Pablo de Sarasate&#8217;s &#8216;Zapateado&#8217; that proved to be the highlight of the night with Carol&#8217;s bow seeming to have a mind of its own.&#8216;Le Cygne&#8217; by Saint Seans and Tschaikowsky&#8217;s &#8216;From Concerto No.1&#8217; by Violin Joy were rich in melody. C.J. Petit&#8217;s &#8216;Sonate en Sol majeur&#8217; in three movements-moderato, adagio and allegro was a delightful blend of the violin and the piano as Violin Joy and Carol were accompanied by Julian.The evening ended with a recital by Julian &#8211; Beethovan&#8217;s &#8216;Piano Sonata Op. 57 &#8216;Appassionata&#8217; 2 and 3 movements, Andande con moto, Allegro ma non troppo&#8217; which was met with applause. A grand finale indeed.
