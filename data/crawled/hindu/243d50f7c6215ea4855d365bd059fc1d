VDwaram Lakshmi, granddaughter of legendary violin maestro Dwaram Venkataswami Naidu and daughter of vidwan Dwaram Bhavanarayana Rao, sang for Swarajhari Sabha at Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram, which was recently handed over to Sringeri Sarada Peetham. Lakshmi, now working as a professor in Padmavathi Mahila University, Tirupati, had her initial training from her parents and later advanced training from M.L. Vasantakumari, T.R. Subramanyam, D.K. Jayaraman, and J.V.S. Rao. She also received Hindustani vocal training from Pandit J.V.S. Rao. She has many achievements to her credit in her musical career and published several books on music. Clarity of diction, good style and melodious voice are Lakshmi's assets. Her concert began with Vatapi in Hamsadhvani which was concluded with good swara kalpana. Next she sang Brovabharama in Bahudari and followed it with an exhaustive and impressive raga elaboration of Dharmavathi in which she rendered Dikshitar's Parandhamavathi treating it with devotional mood to suit the appeal of the composition. Fine kalpana swaras marked the keertana.After rendering an Uttukadu Venkata Subbaiaher composition in Mohana and a Tamil keertana in Kanada, Lakshmi delineated Kambhoji before she rendered Dikshitar's Navavarana keertana Kamalambikayai, closing it with efficient swarakalpana. The main piece in Lakshmi's concert was an excellent Pallavi in Behag preceded by highly skilled alapana. The alapana, tanam and the elaboration of the pallavi Sri Kanakadurga Seveham &#8212; Maleswara Sametam (sung aptly in praise of the presiding deity of Vijayawada) were presented with expertise and efficiency.Violin accompanist B.V. Durgabhavani presented melodious versions of Kambhoji and Behag. K. Sadgurucharan's feather touch on the mridangam was soothing and marked with clarity. The tani played by Sadgurucharan and M. Haribabu (ghatam) was thrilling. Lakshmi concluded her concert with Devaranamas.
