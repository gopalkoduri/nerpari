VOf the younger brigade of musicians aspiring to make Annamacharya&#8217;s untouched compositions popular, S.Venumadhav&#8217;s name is in forefront. He is a versatile musician and much sought after. Gifted with a mellifluous voice, Venumadhav has bee\u000an rendering Annamacharya kirtanas at various concerts. He set music to 45 kirtanas of Annamacharya, so far, in as many ragas.He says his immediate goal is to compose 108 (Ashtothara Sata) untouched kirtanas of Annamacharya, render and record them.There are in fact 12,000 available songs of Annamayya, that are yet to be set to a tune. What Venumadhav and others did so far is very little. He gave the taste of his effort in a concert he presented for Sujanaranjani at Hanuman Devasthanam,  Sanatnagar. Sahitya clarity and apt musical appeal were the hallmark of his concert. Pawan Singh on violin and Vidyasagar on mridangam accompanied him.Such was Venumadhav&#8217;s expressive rendition, that one could follow the thematic context of each number. Opening Nata raga compositionAtivaro Sri Venkatagiri Meeda Veededescribes some avataras (incarnations) of Mahavishnu.Muddugaaree Choodarammain Mohana detail pranks of child Krishna.Talachina Hrudayamu Jhallanuin Abheri describes the beauty of Alamelu Manga, the consort of Lord Venkateswara.Kaalamulaarunu Kaligeneeku Nidewas a typical song of Annamayya that projects the poet&#8217;s ability in telling volumes in few words.Here he says: Venkateswara could get the feel of every season (Rituvu) just by looking at the changes in Alamelumanga&#8217;s attire and behaviour. This was set in Vasantha ragam. The kirtanaAyyo veedu Nannadagincheneprojected Alamelumanga as Khandita Nayaki, upset at her husband&#8217;s waywardness. She feels He cheated on her.Mokkaro Mokkaro Meeru Momuna Kalalu Deredepicts Radhotsavam scene of the Lord and Annamacharya appeals to the bhaktas to prostrate before Him. This was set in Amritavarshini. Venumadhav used this raga to give a touch of classicism by presenting a bit of raga and swaras.The kritis were varied in appeal and Venu chose apt ragas for setting the kirtanas. Accompanists lent a good support to the young vocalist.
