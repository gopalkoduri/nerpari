VKalasagaram celebrated its 43rd annual music, dance and drama festival at Keyes High School, Hyderabad, with a vocal recital by leading vocalist T.M. Krishna on the inaugural day. This nine-day festival is featuring leading musicians from the south and launched the music season in Hyderabad with its annual award, Sangeetha Kalasagara, being conferred upon T.M. Krishna on the first day.Krishna in the company of Sriram Kumar on the violin, Arun Prakash on the mridangam and Guru Prasad on the ghatam began his concert with Hecharikaga rara in Yadukula Khambhoji which was elegantly presented. The majestic Thodi was hummed for Ninne namminanu in Viloma Chapu in vilambith style with sound neraval which is the hallmark of his singing.Much to the surprise of many, Krishna sang Vathapi in Hamsadwani rather suddenly. Andolika, a difficult raga, was taken as the first expansion for Thyagaraja's Raga sudha which was presented neatly. Manasa Sanchara re in Sama came just before the Ananda Bhairavi which was the main attraction of the day. The ragam was appealing for O jagadamba, a majestic kriti in vilamba adi.Krishna was excellent in his kalapramana and the neraval was very pleasing with good phrases of the ragam. The violinist contributed to the concert with his accurate and sweet tonal quality and apt responses. Arun's mridangam accompaniment was top class with clean following. The concluding items Rangabharo of Purandaradasar, Sagara sayana vibho in Bhagesree, Jagadhodharana in Kapi and Vandemataram, a raga malika, were presented with rich ragabhavam and aesthetics. On the whole the concert was very good with good teamwork.
