VTo celebrate the magnificence of India&#8217;s classical heritage, Ranjana Gauhar&#8217;s academy Utsav recently organised &#8220;Saare Jahaan Se Accha-2008&#8221;, a two-day festival of music and dance at the India  Habitat Centre.Among the highlights was a Hindustani vocal concert by Shubha Mudgal. Shubha, in her seasoned voice backed with an articulate mind, opened her  recital with Jaijaivanti, one of the most melodious evening ragas, which is not heard very often. The slow khayal framed in vilambit Ek tala explored every aspect of the raga in depth, weaving delightful musical phrases during the alap barhat. The skilfully crafted and effortlessly executed taans came later. The drut khayal kept up the promise of the previous khayal with a similar lyric in Teen tala composed by Ramarang, her guru, Pandit Ramashreya Jha. Her supple voice full of controlled power had immense appeal even during the concluding thumri, &#8220;Abke Sawan Ghar Aaja&#8221; set to Deepchandi, expressing yearning and pathos through the charming bol-banaav. Sudhir Nayak accompanying her on the harmonium also handled the mood sensitively while the laggi on tabla by Aneesh Pradhan was marked by  precision.The India International Centre (IIC) presented a Hindustani vocal recital by Vishvanath, a promising disciple of Pandit Mani Prasad of the Kirana gharana, at the IIC auditorium. He unfurled raga Madhuvanti with two compositions set to vilambit Ek tala and Teen tala respectively. The systematic alap of sur-dar-sur barhat during the slow khayal, that saw him reach till Nishad and then dramatically come back to the tonic (Madhya Sa) gave a sense of wonder. The long sustained perch on Taar Shadja thereafter was remarkable. He presented an array of sargam and aakar taans in both the khayals that seemed impressive in the beginning but, the oft-repeated phraseology in the fast tempo limited its appeal somewhat. Vishvanath presented two compositions in Malhar before concluding his performance with a Bhairavi bhajan. Rafiuddin Sabri provided commendable tabla accompaniment while Manu Maharaj supported him on the harmonium.Subhadra Desai&#8217;s vocal recital was one of the highlights of the classical concerts held at the Epicentre this past week. A talented disciple of Pandit Vinay Chandra Maudgalya and Madhup Mudgal, Subhadra was further groomed by Malini Rajurkar after being awarded the Maniman scholarship of Sanskriti Pratishthan. Her detailed treatment of raga Miyan Malhar with the traditional slow Ek tala composition &#8220;Karim naam tero&#8221; and a couple of bandishes in medium and fast Teen tala was authentic. The Gaud Malhar that followed with two lovely compositions in Teen tala complemented the seriousness of the earlier Malhar with its romantic aura.The intricate nuances of the tappa that followed in Khamaj were evident from the introductory alap itself. Her command over this challenging form bore the signature of her guru Malini Rajurkar in full measure, before she concluded with a delightful bandish in Teen tala, embellished with delicacy of phrase, design and decoration. Prasoon Chatterjee on the tabla and Mahesh on the harmonium gave her perfect accompaniment.
