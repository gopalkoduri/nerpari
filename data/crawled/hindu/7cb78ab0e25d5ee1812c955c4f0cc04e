VNAGARAJ RAO Havaldar, one of the leading Hindustani vocalists of the State, gave up his job in All India Radio to plunge into music full time. The idea of his music being barricaded within an institution didn't seem a pleasant thing for Havaldar. He decided to pursue music single-mindedly. It was he who pioneered the tradition of Kannada khayal by adapting the lyrics of vachanakaras and haridasas of Karnataka.This time, this unusual musician is back in news again with an ambitious plan of setting up a digital library and music archives in Bangalore under the Sunaada Art Foundation and Pragna Vedike banner. This would be available on the Internet without infringing upon copyrights. They also request the general public to come forward and offer from collection all music that is rare and live.Havaldar also believes that this is the only way in which our rich tradition can be preserved for posterity. "What is the use of keeping all that glorious music with myself. It should reach people," he insists. Apart from this, this acclaimed musician promises that they have several plans lined up for the Foundation and the music loving public.As part of this momentous occasion, they are organising a two-day classical music festival on March 19 and 20 at Shivaratreeshawara Kendra, Jayanagar 8th Block. There will be a santoor recital by R. Vishveshwaran, vocal by Panchakshariswami Mattigatti, a tabla recital by Kallur Mahalakshmi Tabla Vidyalaya, Ustad Balekhan, Ashok Huggannavar and Nagaraj Rao Havaldar himself.For details call 26691657/ 56991432.Bottom Template Starts
