VSreevalson J. Menon's concert was a rare one. The entire event illustrated the necessary ingredients an ideal concert is supposed to embody, including an artiste's stage presence and mannerisms. While the artiste's composure and measured singing stood for the body of the concert, his profound involvement in fully realising the musical core of the compositions he selected, epitomised the soul of singing.Succulent voice carefully honed to fall on the ears gently and softly, rich deep resonance that is capable of imparting authority to his style, tasteful selection of compositions indicating meticulous planning and aesthetic presentation oconstituted the singer's musical personality.The concert started revealing all the above salient features when he began in a majestic pace, Pachimiriam Adiappayya varna, &#8220;Viriboni&#8221; (Attathala). Varieties of graces, the composition is known to exemplify, were complete, deep and fluent. A firm grip over the laya was another ingredient fortifying the progressions.Fine intonations working in perfect harmony with the gamut and volume of his voice, were almost like features perfectly tailored to animate the sahityas of various sentimental imports and ragas of different dimensions.Vocal inflections and articulations in the lower octaves perfectly matched with the gravity of the devotional aspects: Sreevalson smoothly glided into the lower octaves while reciting the phrase &#8220;Bhukti Mukti Pradam&#8221; of Vasudevachar's &#8220;Bhajare Manasa&#8221; in Abheri.Nevertheless, the lyrical sections were not entirely devoid of shortcomings, unawares, carried by his streaming extempore. Though the general diction remained meaningful, there were instances of either wrong splitting of the words (like Thyagara - Juni in &#8220;Rama Nipai Tanaku&#8221; of Thyagaraja in Kedara) or strong accentuation on wrong places (on Dambikayai in &#8220;Brihadambikayai&#8221; of Dikshithar in Vasantha) causing uneasiness for those who depend on the lyrical imports also, for an appreciation in its entirety.As he treated with due care, as to every subtlety, the ragas like Abheri, Mayamalavagoula, and Panthuvarali (&#8220;Sundarataradeham&#8221; - Thyagaraja), the singer remarkably expanded Kamboji (&#8220;O Rangashayi&#8221; -Thyagaraja). The latter one was the focus of the concert, and therefore received comprehensive scholarly attention.He built the alapana in Kamboji systematically and analytically, exposing its characteristics and nuances in every passage his extempore imaginatively evolved. He extended such melodic and lyrical interpretations to the neraval (at the charana section, &#8220;Bhuloka Vaikuntha&#8221;) and kalpanaswaras too.The melody accompanist, H.K. Narasimhamurthy (violin) was at his best in Kambhoji in contrast to his approach to Panthuvarali). Young Radhesh's (mridanga) control over his instrument was amazing in uniquely framing rhythm-passages and in effecting feather-touch crisp beats redolent with fine resonance. Shri Shaila (ghata) appropriately complemented all the artistes.
