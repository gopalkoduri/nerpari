VCharsur Digital Workstation have brought out a compact disc featuring Aruna Sairam as the vocalist who has rendered compositions on the deities of some of the prominent temples in Chennai.A slokam in Nattai, Arabhi and Sudha Dhanyasi serves as a curtain raiser to this disc. The slokam composed by Sengalipuram Anantharama Dikshitar on Lord Parthasarathi leads  to the Atana classic of Mysore Sadasiva Rao &#8216;Vachamagochara.&#8217; Had the third raga of the preceding sloka been sung in Atana, it would have blended finely with the kriti. Aruna has sung this great composition with gusto and self enjoyment. The chittaswara and the corresponding sahitya, where the swarakshara techinque is in abundance, has the listener wanting to salute the composer. Aruna has been the beneficiary of this composition from the treasure troves of Veena Dhanammal through T.Brinda.Select verses from the &#8216;Vadivudai Amman Padigam&#8217; have been vocalised in Bilahari, Kalyanavasantham, Sahana and Kalyani with an element of drama. The raga phrase,sa n d p ma g r ga sa,which appears towards the close of the Kalyanavasantham section of the virutham, would have been apt if theri ga saphrase had been eschewed and sung as justs n d p m g r s. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Sundari Nee&#8217; (Kalyani) is one amongst the Thiruvottriyur Pancharatna kritis on Goddess &#8216;Tripurasundari&#8217; also referred to as &#8216;Vadivudaiamman&#8217; in Thamizh. This kriti rendering is enjoyable and the focus has been on the clear lyrical enunciation. The kalpanaswaras, which are pegged on to the song, are rendered merely as a formality, which could have been altogether avoided. The melkala swaras are too brief to make any sort of an impression.A couple of Papanasan Sivan&#8217;s compositions &#8216;Nambikettavar&#8217; (Hindolam) and &#8216;Kapali&#8217; (Mohanam) are spirited renditions. These are preceded by Arutpa and Thevaram verses sung as ragamalika viruthams. The tail-enders are a Thiruppugazh &#8216;Nisanaranadi&#8217; in Chenjuruti,  selections from Appar&#8217;s Thevaram and the famous padam in Atana &#8216;Thiruvottriyur Tyagarajan&#8217; composed by Ghanam Krishna Iyer.Aruna&#8217;s singing of another Tirupugazh &#8216;Marumalli&#8217; in a haunting Subapantuvarali and a brief rendering of Pasurams by Tirumangai, Peyazhwar and Tirumazhisai azhwar bring the curtains down on this enjoyable disc.The mridangist J. Vaidhyanathan&#8217;s contribution is no small measure and his long association with the vocalist has him anticipate every nuance and flourish in the compositions sung by Aruna. H.N. Baskar (violin) and S. Karthik (Ghatam) have also lent their services for this recording.Charsur Digital Work stationAruna SairamCarnatic &#8211; Audio CD (Price Rs.195)
