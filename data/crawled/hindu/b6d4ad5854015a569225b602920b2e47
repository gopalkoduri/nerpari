VThe first concert was a vocal duet by Mayavaram sisters Uma and Geeta. They are disciples of late K.S. Krishna Murthy. Meechu Krishnaiah&#8217;s compositionDaya Payonidhein Jaganmohini was the starting item. The voices of the sisters were good but the overall effect of their concert was some what on the mediocre side. Uma and Geeta sangKaruna Joodavammaof Syamasastri inVaralirendering it with impressivealapanaandswaras. Fine support of the duo came from Lalitha Raghavan (violin), P. Ramesh (mridangam) and K. Gnananandam (Kanjira). The sisters renderedLaliyugaveinNeelambariand athillanainJonpuri.A. Ananta Padmanabhan, a vainik and a staffer of Trissur Akashvani, gave a melodious concert as the second programme of the evening.

A happy blend ofGayakistyle and sensible sound modulation marked Ananta Padmanabhan&#8217;s playing. Starting withAnuragamuleniof Thyagaraja inSaraswathi, he played as the main item, a hauntingly sweet delineation ofKafipreceding the Thyagaraja keertanaInta Sowkhyamu. Thekalpana swarasalso were crisp and carried the ragabhava. As the final item, Padmanabhan played a fine Meera bhajanKandha TereinSindubhairavi.
