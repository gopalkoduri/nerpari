VS. Shashank, accompanied by Charulatha Ramanujam (violin), Arjun Kumar (mridanga), and Giridhar Udupa (ghata), presented a flute recital recently as part of the Ninth Karthika Sangeethotsava of the Nadaranjani Sangeetha Sabha, Bangalore.The ata thala varna in Kanada marked the beginning of a concert that was remarkable for its blend of melody, technical prowess and soaring manodharma. A mellow sketch of Natta raga was next, followed by the krithi &#8220;Jayajayajaya Janakikantha&#8221;, adorned with a few kalpana swaras. A lilting exposition of Nagagandhari preceded &#8220;Sarasijanabha Sodari&#8221;', the Dikshitar composition set to rupaka tala. A leisurely elaboration of Chandrajyothi, illumining the unique beauty of the scale with a number of sweet phrases was succeeded by Thyagaraja's &#8220;Bagayanayya&#8221;, set to adi tala, and several rounds of kalpana swaras that included a final stint around the dhaivatha.The focal point of the concert was a raga tana pallavi in Keeravani. While the raga alapana progressed gradually with exquisite sancharas spun around long plain notes, the tana gathered speed and vigour as it traversed the three octaves in a profusion of complex patterns. The flautist explained the tala of the pallavi as an 18-beat cycle, later to be compressed into nine beats, which in practice translated into variations of the khanda jathi triputa tala. The entire exercise, including the kalpana swaras, was a brilliant kaleidoscope of multiple tempos, rhythms and ragas and a contrast to the tranquil charm of the recital hitherto, with the accompanists responding to the melodic and rhythmic challenges in admirable fashion.The Rajamahal Vilas Sangeetha Sabha hosted a vocal duet by the Kasaravalli Sisters, Roopa and Deepa, accompanied by Mathur R. Srinidhi (violin), C. Cheluvaraju (mridanga) and Dayananda Mohite (ghata), last weekend.The concert got off to a bright start with &#8220;Samidayajuda&#8221;, the aditala varna in Kedaragoula, Mysore Vasudevacharya's &#8220;Girija Ramana&#8221; in Gambhiranatta, supplemented with some lively kalpana swaras, and Thyagaraja's &#8220;Makelara&#8221; in Ravichandrika. Though the short alapana of Reethigoula that followed seemed slightly rushed, it incorporated the essence of the raga, as did &#8220;Nannu Vidachi&#8221; in misra chapu thala.An appealing elaboration of Ranjini, replete with intricate sancharas, prefaced &#8220;Durmargachara&#8221; in rupaka tala, suffixed with imaginative kalpana swaras, while &#8220;Meevalla Gunadosha&#8221;, the Thyagaraja composition in Kapi raga and khanda chapu thala, provided a brisk interlude before the main raga of the evening, Karaharapriya.The raga alapana was fairly detailed and meticulously executed, running the entire gamut of the scale in a series of nuanced sancharas around significant notes such as the panchama, dhaivatha, tara sthayi shadja and rishabha. A graceful rendition of the beautiful krithi &#8220;Janakipathe&#8221; in adi tala was reinforced by kalpana swaras in the second speed, with a number of cycles of diminishing length ending at the dhaivatha, concluding with a long segment suffused with raga bhava and culminating in a tani avarthana.However, the item would have been enriched further by the inclusion of a few avartanas of neraval. Timely and tuneful accompaniment by the violinist and expert support from the percussionists effectively underscored the efforts of the vocalists.
