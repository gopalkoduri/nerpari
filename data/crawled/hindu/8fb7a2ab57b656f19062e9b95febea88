VConnoisseurs, especially those who bemoan increasing evidence of a decrease in the tribe of highly skilled veena exponents, were in for a treat at Bonala Shankara Prakash&#8217;s recital under the auspices of the Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams, Chennai.Doing his father and guru, Bonala Jagannatham proud, the artist expressed his musical convictions through a vocabulary that stood out for its elegance and meaningful content.The Vasantha varnam &#8216;Ninnukori&#8217; and Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Therathiyaga Raadha&#8217; (Gowlipanthu) invested the opening with solemnity. Achieving a golden mean between azhuttam and melody, the artist explored Sriranjani in raga, kriti (&#8216;Gajavadana,&#8217; Papanasam Sivan) and swaraprasthara. The niraval embellishing &#8216;Saraswathi Namosthuthe&#8217; (Sarasawathi, G.N. Balasubramaniam) assumed a rare luminosity with gentle cadences, the khanda and tisra gait kalpanaswaras in judicious measure conveying both discretion and valour, the result of focused sadhana.A serene overture announced the entry of Dvijavanthi raga and Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Akhilandeshwari,&#8217; the artist breathing life into the delineations with sancharas that glowed, coalesced and beckoned. Fluidity and felicity guided the rendition of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Tanavaari Tanamu&#8217; (Begada). Fervent audience request yielded a gimmick-free &#8216;Nagamomu&#8217; in medium tempo.The artist struck gold in the main piece in Purvikalyani. Mining deep, Shankara Prakash unearthed precious nuggets shot through with veins and streaks of spontaneity. There was no room for the pedestrian. Rich double gamakas and deep jarus crafted a memorable alapana that flowed now rapid, now gloriously languid, charged throughout with an undercurrent of the raga&#8217;s essential energy.Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s emotive masterpiece &#8216;Meenakshi Memudam&#8217; was literally articulated &#8212; so close to vocalisation of lyric was the rendition. The tisra patterns in kizhkala and the khanda patterns in melkala alternated with chatusra gait kalpanaswaras in a sophisticated matrix.V.L. Kumar (violin) put his best foot forward in an attempt to tune in to the main artist&#8217;s formula-free wavelength. Shankar Prakash was ably assisted in his endeavours by Shertalai Ananthakrishnan (mridangam) and Pudukkottai N. Ramachandran (ghatam), whose playing was distinguished by subtlety and an unerring instinct for aesthetic highlights.
