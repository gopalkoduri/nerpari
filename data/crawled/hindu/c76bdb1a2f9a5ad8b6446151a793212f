V&#8220;Several researches have pointed out that there were about 400 Haridasas in Karnataka who poured their spiritual experiences in lyrical form in the 15th and 16th Centuries. Unfortunately, we have unearthed only 10 per cent of them and only a handful is popular in music platforms today,&#8221; says Carnatic vocalist, Mysore Nagamani Srinath. Her eagerness to propagate the thoughts of Haridasas not just has her take up a good measure of dasa-sahitya in her concerts, but also has her zealously involved in conducting Devaranama Workshops in Bangalore, Mangalore, Puttur, Shimoga, Chitradurga, Mysore and Hassan where she finds the young and old flocking her sessions. As an extension of her role, Nagamani has now come up with twin audio-discs &#8220;Haridaasa Deepthi&#8221; containing 101 Dasarapadas of which 11 are from the lady-haridasas of the State. &#8220;Dasa-sahitya is one of the foremost forms of devotional narrative in simple and understandable Kannada written five centuries ago,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The focus is the essence of &#8216;Hari Bhakthi&#8217; and surrender to Lord Vithala of Pandharapur even as the thought-flow is an appealing essence of the Vedas, Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita,&#8221; says Nagamani, who took a few months to wrap up her endeavour that &#8220;caters to diverse section of rasikas.&#8221; So, some are in the Bhajana-sampradaya format; the classical touch is in her using conventional sangati-laden style in Kalyani or Atana; Madhuvanti, Ahir Bhairav and Mishra Bhoop show up for melting Hindustani scales and several more have a fusion effect with instrument orchestration. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want the Haridasa specials to be restricted to its subject alone, some drama and novelty came in my selection like Sarasangi for the first pada, and rare raga scales like Krishna Mani, Shubali, Soorya, Varamu and Jaa Sammohini for some others. I have retained the glorious scales that made about 15 padas ever-popular as they are today and tuned the rest in ragas that suited the lyrics and the mood-flow,&#8221; she says.The excitement, however, was her inclusion of lady Haridasas wherein the lyrics of Helavanakatte Giriyamma, Bellari Radhabai, Saraswatibai, Ambabai, Yadugiriyamma and Nanjangud Tirumalamba not only enclosebhakthiandmukthiin flowing spiritual poetry, but lend themselves to some outstanding musical form, says Nagamani.Some of the other saints who figure in the album are Purandaradasa, Kanakadasa, Sripadaraja, Vyasaraya, Vadiraja, Jagannathadasa, Naraharitheertha, Vijaya Vittaladasa, Gopaladasa and Prasanna Venkatadasa.Brought out by Sunaada Cultural Centre, Karnataka Ganakala Parishat released the discs in its Annual Conference at Holenarsipura and the proceeds go towards the working of the Sabha. &#8220;There are 101 padas, and the twin package costs Rs. 300. How about spending Rs. 3 for a kriti for a wealth of information by our musical saints?&#8221; asks Nagamani.(Call 23585705 for details)
