VAn absolute and incommunicable silence pervaded the sprawling complex of the Isha centre in front of the Lingabhairavi shrine at the foothills of Velliangiri in Coimbatore. The place reverberated with music and attracted rasikas to enjoy the music of Anil Srinivasan and Gurucharan.The rasikas had gathered to assure themselves of a sumptuous musical fare. The well-known duo with Purushothaman on the ganjira, presented a new format of Carnatic music using the classical piano at the Isha fest organised by Isha foundation with The Hindu as the media partner.Every number chosen for the classical recital was preceded by a short intro by Anil Srinivasan in chaste diction. The lyrical beauty of the opening &#8216;Naan Oru Vilayattu Bommaya' in Navarasakannada was enhanced by the melody from the piano played by Anil.&#8216;Nee Vaaradhirundhal' in ragamalika and Muthuthandavar's padam, &#8216;Theruvil Vaaraano' (Khamas) were reflective of their meaningful contents. The pianist's presentation of the sangatis and their 12 variations citing the example of &#8216;Twinkle, twinkle little star' and the song &#8216;Chinnanchiru Pennpolae' were the tours de force of the concert. The vocalist's alapana of Purvikalyani mapped the contours of the raga with elegance.The rendition of &#8216;Sarvam Brahmamayam' in Madhuvanthi was in tune with the symbolic Dhyanalingam. A vibrant tillana closed their musical agenda.Rooted in Hindustani musicMelodious notes from his three-and-a-half ft long shank bansuri wafted through the ineffable atmosphere of Isha fest of music and dance. Accompanied by Indraneel Mullick on the tabla and Kalpesh Sachala on the flute, Pt. Ronu Majumdar entertained the audience through the reed for nearly two hours. Rooted in the Malhar gharana of Hindustani classical music, the flautist explored the beauty and the essence of the raga while elaborating it in the alap portion. Prefacing the recital with a remark that music inculcates sensitivity and that it heals the tormented mind, he chose the madhyama raga Bagesri for the composition &#8216;Kaise Karoon' in jhaap taal (ten beats) revealing its intrinsic beauty and inner content in a sublime manner sans gimmicks. The vilambit and the rise to the drut in teen taal was ecstatic. The listeners could easily visualise the sad tones in the sweet melody as he played the soft notes.Soulful presentationPt. Jasraj's dignified gait in prayerful silence towards the platform showed his deep absorption in the Divine Mother. His singing was distinguished by this in his Hindustani vocal concert. The foremost exponent of Mewati gharana did not disappoint his rasikas. Groomed by Baba Shyam Manohar Goswami, the veteran's vocal range extending across three-and-a-half octaves while singing the composition &#8216;Om! Mangalam Bhagwan Vishnu, Mangalam Garudadwaja' in rhythmic tone struck a chord with the listeners. Swami Vivekananda's composition &#8216;Har Har Har Bhoothnath Pasupathi,' that followed, when sung with the accompaniments was a poetic rhythm.The other song, &#8216;Dekho More Rang Mein Bhigoye' was a soulful presentation.&#8216;Jagadamba Suramuni' and &#8216;Prabhu Jagannatha Natham' with several sangatis towards the end were marked by devotional fervour. The haunting melody of his transcendental music was awesome. Vijay Ghat (tabla), Sridhar Parthasarathi (mridangam), Mukund Phetkar (harmonium) and Shashank Subramaniam (flute) &#8211; the accompanists &#8211; lent dignity to the concert.Isha Foundation's annual festival of music and dance &#8211;YAKSHA&#8212;culminated on Mahasivaratri day, March 4.Thousands of devotees attended the night-long satsangh led by Jaggi Vasudev. The holy event was preceded by a seven-day session of Hindustani and Carnatic music and dance recitals. The programme began with a Sufiana/Qawwali by Wadali Brothers followed by Prem Joshua and Band's fusion and world music. The fusion percussion Ensemble of Bickram Ghosh's Rhythmscape and Sounds of Isha providing urban folk music followed by a Fire dance sent the crowd into raptures. As the clock struck 12, Sadguru initiated the gathering into the sacred Mahamantra meditation with the chant of &#8216;Om Namah Sivaya.'
