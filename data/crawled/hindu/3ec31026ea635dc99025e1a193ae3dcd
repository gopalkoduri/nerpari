VKalasagaram  organised a three-day youth fest to provide  platform to the prize winners of the music competitions held by them recently. Lakshmi, a disciple of Dr. Panthularama, a leading vocalist from Visakapatnam, is a recipient of the Kalasagaram Tambura Prize in 2008.Her voice  can reach thetarasthaias well as the lower octaves. She started her recital withSurati Varnam.Datta GanapathiinMohanamof Deekshitar was the next , followed byAndolikawhereRagasudharasawas rendered more technically. Instead of beginning withMayamalava Gowlashe sangTulasidalamula Cheof Thyagaraja withneravalandswaramin it. The rendition ofMamava Paatabhi Ramainmanirangwas strange at this point as it usually sung at the end of the concert.Kapinarayaniwas a good attempt and theragacame out in a flash. Lakshmi also sang a Tamil composition for the Kalasagaram audience. RTP was the main focus, and for this, she choose Bhairavi. . . Thepallaviset inmisragathi aditalamwas well executed. Raghuram on violin did well  but hiskrithiaccompaniment  needs to improvement. Pappu Jayadev exelled in thetani.  Lakshmi concluded her recital with aJayadeva AshtapadiinAmirkalyani tillanainChenchuti.Swathi amd Sowmya who performed on the 3rd day are trained by violin vidhwan Surya Deepthi, who works with AIR. Swathi is doing her M.Tech and Sowmya is doing her MBBS. . These up-and-coming artistes have won several prizes and are showing the right attitude towards  Carnatic music. The approach to the concert by the sisters was  well balanced. They began withBhaiaravi Atatala varnamViribhoni. The two synchronised well. Sri Ganapathi in Sowrastra,Ninne BhajanainNataiwithSwaram,Mayateeta Swaroopiniin Mayamalava Gowla  started the concert in the first part in style.  The concert was ably supported by Surya Deepthi,  a senior mridangam vidwan. Sadgurucharan and Satya Sai were on the morsing. Thetaniby the percussion duo in thePallaviset toKhandajhathi triputatalamwas laudable.The first day of the fest featured Sivani a child prodigy with more exposure into Annamacharya, film singing and light classical music. She began withbegada varnam, and sungGaajananyuthamin Chakrawakam.Then she sang Ganapathi Sachidananda&#8217;sBhavaye Vaisnaviin Saraswatiragam. TheswaraminAmmaravammawas impressive.Dhanyasiwas a good choice andNeechittamuof Thyagaraja, was rendered neatly. After a fast numberNiravadhisukhainRavichandrika, Sivani tookbhairavias the mainragam.Herragammissed the important links as it was sung methodically. Balagopala of Deekshitar was a good choice and could have been presented in a better way. Young Peri Thyagaraja on the violin and Burra Sreeram on the mridangam did their best to keep up the spirit of the concert.
