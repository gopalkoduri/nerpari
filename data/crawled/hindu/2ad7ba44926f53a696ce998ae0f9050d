VK. KrishnakumarBinni KrishnakumarTimes MusicMRP Rs 125.A compromise on the sruti (pitch) has to be arrived at generally when a singing duo consists of a male and a female vocalist. This might not enable them  to give a free reign to their manodharma and to some extent will restrict their creativity. This\u000a is not felt in the combination of the voices of K. Krishnakumar and Binni Krishnakumar. Their voices blend well in the recently released audio compact disc titled &#8216;Divine Ragas&#8217; by Times Music.The evergreen &#8216;Vatapi Ganapatim&#8217; (Hamsadhwani, Muthuswamy Dikshitar) is sung as the curtain raiser. The singers choose to be dramatic while rendering the lyric &#8216;Hamsadhwani&#8217; in  the charanam. A chittaswaram composed by their guru M. Balamuralikrishna is sung with a good grip in both chatusra and tisra modes.  The violinist V.V. Srinivasa Rao falters while playing  the second round of solfa passage.After a hesitant beginning, Binni&#8217;s Purvikalyani  gains  clarity as the alapana progresses. The composition sung is a creation of M. Balamuralikrishna (&#8216;Nee Dayarada&#8217;). The singers do justice to this kriti rendition though it occurred to this reviewer that the composition creates a better impact when sung by the composer himself. The vinyasa of Kapi by Krishnakumar reveals his talent. The violinist offers a tidy raga reply as well. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Intha Sowkya&#8217; is sung with a good focus on the diction of the lyrics. The percussionists Mannarkovil J. Balaji (mridangam) and Vaikkom R. Gopalakrishnan (ghatam) have accompanied with a lot of enthusiasm and offer a short precise thani avartanam at the conclusion of the Kapi kriti.The tukkada segment comprises &#8216;Ninaikada Neramillai&#8217;(Ragesri-M.M. Dandapani Desigar), &#8216;Narayana Namo&#8217;(Sarasangi in Madhyama Sruti- Narayana Tirtha ), &#8216;Yake Nirdaya&#8217; (Ragamalika-Purandaradasa) and &#8216;Rama Deiva Sikhamani&#8217; (Sindhubhairavi-Bhadrachalm Ramadas).Binni and Krishnakumar have pleasing and pliable voices and would do well to ensure that the kalapramana of the brigas during raga and niraval singing is complimentary to the slow paced sancharas.
