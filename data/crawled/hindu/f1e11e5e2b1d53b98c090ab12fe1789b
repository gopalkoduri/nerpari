V`These days, television shows give credit to each one of the unit members, down to the spot boy. But how many of them give credit to their violinist, guitarist or a saxophonist,'  asks Shyam Raaj, a saxophonist who has contributed to a number of hits over the years. He started off by learning the violin and then switched to the saxophone. "I was commissioned by a nightclub for a few performances. The saxophone can be played solo, so I chose this instrument. My interest in it grew and I got attuned to playing it to a western music loving audience," he recalls. Once the contract with the nightclub drew to a close, he moved to films.His first film was Raj Kapoor'sBobby, for which he contributed to the background score. "Raj Kapoor was so impressed that he incorporated some of the saxophone bits into the music record." Since then, he's played for Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Oriya films. "Recently, I worked with Ilaiyaraja forShiva 2006. I worked with him for the originalShivaand this was a sort of homecoming," he says. Quiz him about his forthcoming films and he sighs, "I don't know which movies I've played the instrument for. You see, most often, we record our bits and leave. Recording of voices and background music happens in isolation nowadays and you don't get to see the complete picture until an album is released."When he isn't recording for composers like A.R. Rahman and Ilaiyaraja, he gives solo performances or tours abroad alongside artistes like Adnan Sami. His only request: "People like Yash Chopra have begun giving credit to their musicians. I hope others will follow suit. Artistes like me compose for a number of albums, jingles and film numbers but not being given credit does nothing to boost our morale."SANGEETHA DEVI.
