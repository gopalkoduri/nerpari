VRenganayaki's concert filled the hearts of the audience at the &#8216;Eppadi Paadinaaro' series, that took place during the weekend at the FGN Auditorium, Tiruchi. The event was jointly organised by Krishna Sweets and R.R. Sabha.Starting briskly with a varnam in Bhairavi, Renganayaki explored Arabhi in the kriti &#8216;Pranavakaram.' She delivered a fast Dhenuka (&#8216;Teliyaleru Rama') and a commanding Atana (&#8216;Sankarimal').In her orthodox music journey she dealt with Thodi (&#8216;Ninne Nammi') and Balamanjari (&#8216;Sanatana Parama') extensively, with intricate swaras and niravals. Her Mohanam (&#8216;Renganayakam') and Saranga (&#8216;Pachai Mamalai Pol') were fabulous.Violinist Sachidhanandam (Ranganayaki's husband) traversed carefully in the violin and was in tune with the singer throughout.The captivating thani of Madurai Thiagarajan on the mridangam made the concert lively.
