VThere is a reassuring, no-frills solidity to Bharathi Ramasubban&#8217;s music. This very quality that is a touchstone of tradition also opens up avenues for thought. While the artist&#8217;s manodharma strode boldly forward to translate intent into  articulation, it also made you reflect on how aptly this puissance could be complemented by a delicate touch here, a subtle hue there.In her concert for the Music Circle, the vocalist opened with the varnam, &#8216;Sami Ninne Kori&#8217; in Sri ragam. Sarvalaghu patterns lent easy flow and variety to the swarakalpana embellishing the kriti, &#8216;Intha Paraka&#8217;( Mayamalavagowla).A whiff of the 1970s kutcheri nostalgia blew in with the ever-popular &#8216;Seethapathe&#8217; (Khamas) spruced up with elaborate niraval and sprightly kalpanaswaras at &#8216;Premajuchi&#8217; that affirmed raga chaya at each turn.A well-structured Reetigowla alapana with emphatic madhyamakala statements radiating from the madhya stayi madhyama took centre stage.Full throated prayogas at the tara sthayi shadja brimmed with vim and vigour, completing the contribution to a vadi-samvaadi studded delineation whose hallmark was robustness.Lyrical touches were added by talented young violinist, K.P. Nandini, her interpretation heightening flavour while echoing feel.A weighty rendition of &#8216;Dwaitamu Sukhama&#8217;(Tyagaraja) gave ample evidence of the artist&#8217;s fidelity to patanthara. Kalapanaswaras were built tier by tier in a kizhkalam that spoke of dedicated effort.Melkala swaras needed a tighter reign on kalapramana and more insouciance to achieve that quality of seeming effortlessness.An infrequently aired, gamaka-rich &#8216;Sri Kamakshi Maampahi&#8217; (Saranga, Annaswami Sastri) was a welcome offering, with chittaswaram communicating an undulating energy.Two fillers in quick succession highlighted accelerated tempo &#8211; &#8216;Vinatha Sutha Raaraa&#8217; (Huseni, Tyagaraja) and &#8216;Maragatha Lingam&#8217; (Vasanta, Muthuswami Dikshitar).Banking on panchama-centric sancharas that mixed and matched veena and nagaswaram phrasing followed up with vibrant karvais at the tara sthayi shadja, the vocalist constructed a Thodi alapana in which the striking usage of akara showed off her naturally resonant tone to advantage.The same azhutham nourished the sangatis of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Emi Jesithe&#8217;. The focus was on kizhkala in the niraval while competent kalpanaswaras in two speeds added the finishing touch to a tidy portrait.K.P.Nandini&#8217;s solo turn spoke volumes of  her instinctive feel for raga atmospherics. With deft strokes, Praveen Kumar (mridangam) displayed his flair for maintaining an even keel throughout.
