VParashuram's vocal recital was interesting and absorbing. H.K. Narasimha Murthy (violin), G.S. Ramanujam (mridanga) and V.S. Ramesh (ghata) accompanied him. Dharmasthala Manjunatha Institute of Management had arranged Kala Anubhava in Mysore, introducing its students to the delicacies and intricacies of Indian classical music.Clear diction ruled his singing; the lyrical imports shone with full glory and sentiments; and contemplative involvement enlivened the compositions. Right tempo upheld the dignity of the bhasha and magnitude of the sahitya, and right accentuations enhanced the embedded bhava.Dikshitar's two compositions &#8211; &#8220;Shri Muladhara Chakra Vinayakam&#8221; (Shri raga) and &#8220;Pashupatishvaram&#8221; (Shivapantuvarali/ Shubhapantuvarali) stood as testimonies to diction and commitment.Alapana in Shivapantuvarali gained a pleasing momentum from the beginning, progressively reaching gentle climax, most of the movements taking shapes in vilamba and madhyama kaala sancharas, connected by opulence of jaaru gamaka-s. Finely knit swarakalpana-s expanded the mood (rather the feeling), he had instilled into the minds of the listeners through the lyrical sections. As a result the experience proved to be an integrated whole.Though &#8220;Shobillu Saptasvara&#8221; (Jaganmohini &#8211; Thyagaraja) was plain in narrative style, it impressed the audience through sheer clarity and subtle gamakas.As opposed to the above presentations, &#8220;Kayarohanesham&#8221; (sung in Abheri-Dikshithar) could not reach the expected level, may be attributable to the strained chords. Whereas HKN fared well in tune with the approach of the singer, both the percussionists buoyed the listeners, by their versatile approach to resonance and beat-patterns.&#8220;Murahara&#8221; (Purandaradasa), &#8220;Narayana Namo&#8221; (Jhinjooti-Annamacharya), &#8220;Anjaneya Swaminam&#8221; (Hemavathi - Ramaswamy) and a Tillana (Kuntalavarali-Balamuralikrishna) constituted other numbers.Mysore V. Vamshidhar's flute recital was remarkable, with distinct emphasis on simplicity, restraint, proportion and melody. The young artiste successfully exposed his artistry and dexterity, accompanied by stalwarts, Mysore M. Manjunath (violin), Tiruvarur Bhaktavatsalam (mridanga) and Vyasavittala (khanjira).His stronghold is consistency; indeed, time-tested, ensuring elevating accomplishments. Sushira Shri V. Deshikachar Academy of Music had arranged this recital in memory of the renowned luminary Deshikachar.Methodology in elaborating Purvikalyani and Madhyamavati, and the importance given to highlight the imports of &#8220;Maanavajanma&#8221; (Purandaradasa) and &#8220;Palinchu Kamakshi&#8221; (Shyamashastri) may well be considered for analysis.While developing the ragas the sancharas would strictly adhere to the purity of swaras and subtleties of the sancharas. Thootkara-s maintained continuity in the flow of the swaras and the resultant melody too.With the technicalities remaining subservient to the melodic and sentimental aspects, the compositions invariably realised the composer's vision and imagination.Thodi (raga-tana-pallavi) was another exceptional piece of melody, and his control over blowing never muffled the bewitching naada fluently emanating from the instrument.Thana sections, though proved scholarly, playing for the aavartha-s, seemed unusual. Pallavi evolving in an appreciable majestic tempo was absorbing for its simplicity progressing into intricacies as it unfurled within a strict aesthetic ambit.The senior accompanists' surging extempore necessitated more restraint; and tani avarthana could have been gentler considering melodic and reposing nature of the concert.&#8220;Seethapathe&#8221; (Khamach-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Nenarunchinanu&#8221; (Maalavi-Thyagaraja), and &#8220;Saagarashayana&#8221; (Bageshri-M.D. Ramanathan) were other inclusions.
