VYoung R. Sriram presented a 90-minute veena concert for Sri Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer Golden Jubilee Foundation in their annual concert series at the Raga Sudha Hall. It was another young master Bharadwaj on the mridangam.It was fast pace from the word &#8216;go.&#8217; Sriram set the tempo with the Surutti varnam. Hamsadhwani that followed was impressive but full of fast phrases.  A rare krithi &#8216;Pahi Pahi&#8217; (Rupakam &#8211;Mazhavai Chidambara Bharathiyar) followed it with kalapanaswaras on the expected lines.&#8216;Janani Ninnuvina&#8217; (Ritigowlai-Mishram-Subbaraya Sastry) was a sincere attempt while &#8216;Nee Daya Radha&#8217; (Vasantha Bhairavi-Rupakam-Tyagaraja) and &#8216;Nee Vada Ney Gana&#8217; (Saranga-Kandam-Tyagaraja) passed muster.Bhairavi, the main item, was built more on one-day cricket lines. Phrases came one after the other in a cascade. The boy&#8217;s fingering and flow were amazing. But then Sriram should realise that there is beauty and music in the pauses  between phrases. The meditative long karvais were missing. He could have stuck on to Bhairavi in the thanam instead of foraying into a ragamalika thanam.A well polished &#8216;Bala Gopala&#8217; (Adi, Muthuswamy Dikshitar) was presented with aplomb. The kalpanaswara segment lacked imagination and was a mere journey up and down the arohanam and avarahonam.Accompanying veena is an art which even experienced vidwans find tough. It is heart warming to see that young Bharadwaj has already mastered it.  Playing with the ease of a veteran, he never allowed his enthusiasm to take control of the instrument. His blows were soft but telling. The sound engineer had done a good balancing act.The expert, however, played truant at the main concert on Friday last, that of R. Suryaprakash.  With the result, mridangam was loud almost drowning the already thin voice of the main singer. Its time auditoriums thought in terms of shifting the console and the man at the helm to the stereo mid-point of the wall opposite the dais, from where he can judge and balance.&#8216;Brova Barama&#8217; (Bahudari-Adi-Tyagaraja) with kalpanaswaras in sarva laghu, reminded the listener of his guru T.V.Sankaranarayanan. &#8216;Nithya Roopa&#8217; (Rupakam-Tyagaraja) was rendered in Darbar after a brief alapana, though there is a Kapi version of the kriti.&#8216;Deva Deva Jagadeeswara&#8217; (Poorvi Kalyani-Adi-Swati Tirunal) was a victim of the sound man&#8217;s ignorance. The Devagandhari alapana was splendid and it was a  great effort from Suryaprakash in rendering Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Kshirasagara Sayana.&#8217;Normally a tail piece, &#8216;Smara Janaka&#8217; (Behag, Mishram, Swati Tirunal) was a surprise inclusion at this point, like Sreesanth Nair coming in to bat at No: 3.  Taking up Kharaharapriya as the main raga was a bit intriguing. The vocalist had already tackled  Darbar its Janya.  The akara phrases, however, were captivating. Rama nee Yeda (Adi-Tyagaraja) was a faithful rendering. Niraval was taken up in the charanam &#8220;Thana Sowkhiyamutha&#8221; and  thankfully there was no butchering of the sahityam.The replies of Mullaivasal Chandramouli (violin) were distinct and spirited. Particular mention must be made of his ability to strike unison with the singer&#8217;s voice from the beginning. Mali, a seasoned veteran, practically appearing to be a statue on the stage presented a lively thani with interesting patterns. The small variations while on a sarva laghu nadai were attractive.After a brief but captivating Sindubhairavi it was an emotional &#8216;Viswesvara&#8217; of Swati Tirunal. &#8220;Petra Thai Thanai&#8221; that figured in the viruttam segment was a ragamalika  culminating in Jonpuri. Suryaprakash signed  off with Gopalakrishna Bharathi&#8217;s &#8220;Eppo Varuvaro.&#8221;
