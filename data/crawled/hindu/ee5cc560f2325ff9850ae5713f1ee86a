VPantuvarali was dynamic with swirls and brigas in full degree and brightened further with the kriti &#8216;Sada Enna Hrudaya Dalli.&#8217; Sriranjani&#8217;s niraval at &#8216;Ninne Nado Viduava Dilla&#8217; was poignant and the swarakalpana added charm and weight.A Tamil verse on Abhirami came as a prelude in Mohanam for the composition &#8216;Jagadeeswari Kripai Puri.&#8217; Tyagaraja made only a late entry here with the unusual  kriti &#8216;Nija Marmamulanu&#8217; in Umabharanam.  Sankarabharanam shone in brevity. The precise package covered the range but just skimmed the surface. With her voice power and tutelage one expected some extensive and in-depth exploration, especially of Sankarabahranam.Nevertheless, her choice of Syama Sastri&#8217;s  &#8216;Saroja Dala Netri&#8217; proved rewarding. With the time ticking fast, Sriranjani had to directly march towards swaras sans niraval at &#8216;Sama Gana Vinodini.&#8217;The sarva lagu stratagem and the kuriappu swaras circled around gandharam progressing into a well designed korvai.A suggestion here. It is always a better proposition for new entrants to bank on the well known and time tested compositions of the Trinity than take up  little known numbers, rarely heard ragas of less popular composers.Sriranjani was amply supported by Akkarai Swarnalatha on the violin. Swarnalatha executed her part without blemish doing full justice to the core quality of Pantuvarali and Sankarabharanam. Mannargudi Subramaniam, passive initially,   caught up with some quick rounds of rhythmic patterns during tani avartanam.
