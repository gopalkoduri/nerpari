VIt seemed to be a sudden downpour of Carnatic music in Delhi, a welcome downpour indeed.Shretally K.N. Ranganatha Sarma&#8217;s recital under the aegis of Nadhabrahmam was of high quality and  embedded with traditional musical values. Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Kshitijaramanam&#8221;, a slow tempo composition in raga Devagandhari, was presented well. While presenting two Tyagaraja kirtanas subsequently, &#8220;Teliyaleru Rama&#8221; in raga Dhenuka and &#8220;Durmargachara&#8221; in Ranjani, the emotive aspects came to the fore. A good sketch of the raga preceded the later kirtana. The main item of the recital, again a Tyagaraja kirtana, &#8220;Emineramu&#8221; in raga Shankarabharanam. This contained a fine alap  and enjoyable niraval,  as well as creative swara formats. Vittal Ramamurthy provided excellent violin support. Tiruvarur Bhakthavatsalam&#8217;s mridangam  was elegant and graceful. H. Sivaramakrishnan  on the ghatam rose to the occasion. Their tani avartanam session was lively and enjoyable.Manasi Prasad, who reportedly turned down a Rs.1 crore-pay package offer for the sake of art,  was featured on the last day of Nadhabrahmam&#8217;s festival. Her presentation of Tanjore Sankara Iyer&#8217;s Ranjani mala, (a song composed in ragas Ranjani, Sriranjani, Megharanjani and Janaranjani) and Mysore Vasudevacharya&#8217;s &#8220;Bhajare manasa&#8221; in the raga Abheri were impressive. She prefixed the latter composition with a detailed sketch of the raga and suffixed it with niraval and swara formats. Sadly, her recital did not create as lasting an impression as  the reported news of turning down the job offer. Trivandrum S.R. Rajasree on the violin and Mannargudi N. Subramanian on the mridangam provided good support to Manasi.Dwarkalaya&#8217;s festival of music, a tribute to the Tamil composer Papanasam Sivan, opened with the saxophone recital of Kadri Gopalnath and party, at the auditorium of the Delhi Tamil Sangam. Though the presentations of various compositions as such were impressive in this instrument, the bouts of swara formats that followed for every song  he presented till the tani avartanam session (with the exception of &#8220;Durga Lakshmi Saraswati&#8221;  in raga Arabhi) were not all that soothing. Gopalnath opened his recital with Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8220;Gajavadana Karuna&#8221; in the raga Sriranjani. Tyagaraja&#8217;s composition that he took up was &#8220;Maravairi ramani&#8221; in raga Nasikabhushani. Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Akhilandeswari&#8221; was the main item of the recital. A. Kanyakumari on the violin produced a scintillating sketch of the raga Nasikabhushani, besides creative swara formats on all occasions. Harikumar&#8217;s mridangam accompaniment was noisy and his laya depiction, particularly for the slow tempo song, was not soothing either. Delhi&#8217;s Mannai Kannan on the ghatam did not contribute significantly, partly because of Gopalnath&#8217;s intervention. B. Rajashekar on the morshankh provided good support, besides being busier controlling the laya for the entire  concert.At the Yuva Festival presenting performances by  recipients of the Sangeet Natak Akademi&#8217;s Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar-2007, Sikkil C. Gurucharan&#8217;s brief 45-minute recital  was brilliant. His opening piece itself, a Tyagaraja kirtana &#8220;Sittamma mayamma&#8221; in raga Vasanta was very impressive. He followed it with swaraprastaras rich in creativity. Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8220;Janakipate&#8221; in the raga Kharaharapriya was handled well. Gurucharan prefixed this song with a fine sketch of this raga and suffixed it with enjoyable niraval and swaraprastaras. V.S.K. Chakrapani on the violin and P. Jayabhaskar on the mridangam provided good support. Jayabhaskar too was  a recipient of this year&#8217;s Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar. The Akademi could consider hosting only two programmes per day instead of three, as this would have provided awardees some more time to showcase their talents adequately.
