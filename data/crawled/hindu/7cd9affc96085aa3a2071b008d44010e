VSattiraju Venumadhav's vocalism stands out from the rest of the young brigade of musicians purely because of his melodious voice and his ability to espouse his mastery of the nuances and clear diction of sahitya. The concert he gave for Navya Nataka Samiti and Navya Sahiti Samiti at Sundarayya Kala Kendram establishes his ability to meander through the ragas with ease.Starting his vocal recital with Vanajakshi in Kalyani done in two speeds with brief swarakalpana, he came out with rare compositions set in exotic ragas, with integrated nuggets of the raga and the composition.Abheri was chosen as his main melody. The raga essaying was methodical, illustrative in its construction retaining its mood. Nagumomu was his choice number that was rendered with palatable expression. The neravu at the line &#8216; Jagamele Paramatma' accentuated the beauty of the sahitya and the swarakalpana that followed also spoke of his command on the technicalities. Sadasiva Brahmendra's Gayati Vanamaali in Hamsadhwani tuned by Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna appeared towards the end came as pleasant whiff of air. Kolanka Saikumar on violin and Burra Sriram on mridangam lent a uniformly good support. Saikumar excelled in his play of Abheri the main number and Sriram presented a sensible tani avartanam.
