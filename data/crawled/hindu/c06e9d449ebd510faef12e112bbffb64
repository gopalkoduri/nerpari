VThe 35th Neelakanta Sivan Sangeetha Aradhana festival, conducted under the auspices of Sri Neelakanta Sivan Sangeetha Sabha of Thiruvananthapuram, which began on August 1 with Sanjay Subrahmanian's exhilarating concert concluded on August 8 with a memorable show by Renjani and Gayathri.On the third day of the fete this year, Ayamkudi Mani began with Veena Kuppier's varnam &#8216;Vanajaksha' in Behag. &#8216;Geetha vadhya Vatana' in Natakapriya (10th Melakartha Raja), composed by Tanjavur Sankara Iyer, was a brilliant exercise as the vocalist could stick to its original notes.Apt expressionsThe Neelakanta Sivan composition &#8216;Ananda Nadamaaduvar' in Poorvikalyani and Pattanam Subramania Iyer's &#8216;Idi Nyayama' in Malavi were sung with the apt expressions. The relaxed diction of the main kriti &#8211; &#8216;Amba Kamakshi,' a swarajathi in Bhairavi of Syama Sastri &#8211; suffixed with niraval and well-sequenced swaraprastharas was a pleasure to listen to. Mani concluded his concert with &#8216;Kaanthannodu Chennu' in Neelambari and a thillana, both composed by Swati Tirunal. He was ably accompanied by Easwara Varma (violin), Kadanad V.K. Gopi (mridangam) and Ananthakrishnan (ganjira).Abishek Raghuram's outstanding recital was complemented by his strong voice that was aligned to the sruti. His artistry was revealed in his opening number &#8211; a varnam in Darbar. The Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Paraloka Sadaname manasa' revived memories of the the great GNB. A lengthy exposition of Thodi highlighted the singer's loyalty to tradition. Dikshitar's &#8216;Sree Krishnam Bhajamanasa' was captivatingly sung. To conclude, Abishek chose a Swati Tirunal padam in Dwijavanti &#8211; &#8216;Tharuni njan enthu cheivu,' followed by a bhajan in Sidha Bhairavi and the mangalam &#8216;Bhujaga sayino' in Yadukula Kamboji. S.R. Vinu (violin), Trivandrum Balaji (mridangam) and Uduppi Srikanth (ganjira) provided excellent support to the vocalist.The abrupt winding up of the concert much ahead of the usual time and that too without including any of the Neelakanta Sivan compositions disappointed the audience.On the fifth day, S.P. Ramh began his concert with a varnam in Valachi. Syama Sastri's &#8216;Sarojadalanetri' was the main number. &#8216;Venkitachala Nilayam' in Sindhu Bhairavi and &#8216;Bhagyadha Lakshmi Baramma' in Sri Raja brought the concert to a close. On account of his ill health, Ramh could not do full justice to his concert. He was accompanied on the violin by Madurai Balasubamanian who was also not in good form. However, percussionists Umayalpuram Mali (mridangam), Achal Krishna Iyer (ghatam) and Kalamandalam Shaiju (morsing) did their part very well.A meritorious concert was presented by Sreeram Prasad and Ravikumar, popularly known as Malladi Brothers. Beginning with &#8216;Karunimpa,' a varnam in Sahaana, they went on to a fantastic Dikshitar kriti in praise of Lord Siva &#8211; &#8216;Parameswara Jagadeeswara Sankara paahimam' in Natta. Neelakanta Sivan's &#8216;Nava Siddhi Petralum' in Kharaharapriya was charged with devotional fervour.Virtuoso presentation&#8216;Parvathi Ninu ne' in Kalgada, a rare composition of Syama Sastri, proved beyond doubt the virtuosity of the vocalists. An elaborate exposition of Kamboji was followed by Tyagaraja's &#8216;Evarimata.' Their chaste diction brought nostalgic memories of the great maestro Ariyakudi. Niraval at &#8216;Bhakta Paradeenudanuchu' was a superb, imaginative choice. Excellent accompaniment was provided by Nagai R. Sriram (violin), Nanjil Arul (mridangam) and P.L. Sudhir (ghatam).On the final day of the fete, Ranjani and Gayathri opened their account with Veena Kuppier's varnam &#8216;Intha Chalamu jesithe' in Begada. Neelakanta Sivan's &#8216;Oraru Mugane' in Ritigoula was greeted with applause. The alapana, niravel and swaraprasthara were well delineated in &#8216;Birana Brova' in Kalyani, a composition of Talangampadi Panchanada Iyer. &#8216;Koluvai Yunnade' in Bhairavi was the main kriti.The sisters' tonal brilliance got soaked in the raga and every phrase offered was filled with rasa. The post-taniavarthanam session included a Purandarasa padam in Mandu, a Meera bhajan in raga Meg Malhar and a Neelankata Sivan kriti &#8216;Theruvattppo' in Kamas.H.N. Bhaskar (violin), Delhi Sairam (mridangam) and Veellatanjoor Sreejith (ghatam) embellished the concert with their marvellous support.
