VNeither Aruna Sairam nor her musical prowess is new to the Coimbatore music lovers. But what was new on the wet evening of November 25 at the Corporation Hall, R S Puram, Coimbatore, was that her entire concert was devoted to famous Abhangs.Abhangs are Marathi compositions by Sants such as Namdev, Gnaneswar and Tukaram. For those present in the auditorium, it was a real feast of soulful music in praise of the Lord.It was amazing to note that from the standard opening song of &#8216;Ganesh Sthuthi' to the last bhajan &#8216;Bhaje Gunguru,' the artist showed the same involvement, concentration and enthusiasm. This, one could say, is the USP of Aruna Sairam. May be that was the reason why the audience sat enthralled throughout.Her voice modulation especially suited the rendering of Abhangs: bold and vibrant. If in the lower octaves, it was steady and majestic, it was more so in the higher octaves.Another of her strong quality was the way she traversed from one octave to the other, smooth and continuous. Similar was her ability to maintain &#8216;sruthi sudham' even during her prolonged stay on a given note. Perhaps, this was the result of rigorous training in the nuances of Hindustani Music.In the first Abhang, Namdev's &#8216;Thirtha Vittala' , the elaboration of the line &#8216;Matha Vittala, Pitha Vittala,' was spot on. The audience too, realised the aptness, which emphasised the equality of one's parents with the Almighty.The next Abhang, Sant Tukaram's &#8216;Rajasa Sukumara', was slightly different, in a different tempo.Carnatic music lovers could see the resemblance to their own raga, Siva Ranjani, and enjoyed it even more.To emphasise the similarity between namasankirtanam and bhajan, the artist selected &#8216;Thodayamangalam' from the South Indian and traditional &#8216;Katha Kalakshepam.'The continuous rendering of five ragas and five talas was fast paced. All the accompanying percussion instruments followed suit in the same pace and the audience was ecstatic.Aruna Sairam then changed the atmosphere to one of peace and serenity, through her rendering of Samartha Ramadas's Abhang on &#8216;Kolahpur Saraswathi.'The introduction of the occasional fast rhythm symbolising the movement of palanquin bearers, made the song livelier. It was obvious, the artist had done her research well. This could be seen in the next selection where Azhwar Pasuram's &#8216;Pachai Mamalai' was followed by Tukaram's &#8216;Sawale Sundararupa,' which had the same meaning.A treatThe audience was in for a treat, thereafter. They were all transported to the Oases of Rajasthan, on a camel cavalcade. This was the effect when she sang &#8216;Govinda Liyo Mol'.She did break the monotony of desert travel, however, by introducing a Gujarati Garbha Ras.She did justice to the rich traditions of Bengali music by her rendering of &#8216;Suprapatham' to Goddess Durga.The conclusion with a slokam on Venkatachalapathi, followed by &#8216;Mangalam', brought every one back to reality - all good things have to come to an end.Mention must be made of the powerful accompanists. Their ability to control the decibel levels of their instruments in consonance with the mood of the lyrics, was superb. Though, one could not be faulted for wondering whether so many percussion instruments were really needed.Perhaps, it could have been justified, had they been given an opportunity for a thani avarthanam. There is no doubt that it would have been the crowning glory.
