VA scholarly Carnatic vocal concert by Mavelikkara P. Subrahmanian, head of department of music, Swati Thirunal College of Music, Thiruvananthapuram, proved to be a lesson  on how to render a vocal concert that  adheres to traditionalism.With Edapally Ajith on the violin and Cherthala Dinesh on the mridangam, Subrahmanian&#8217;s concert saw the deep understanding and team work between the vocalist and his musicians. Subrahmanian&#8217;s stage presence and excellent kalapramana made the concert a note-worthy one.Subrahmanian opened his concert with a rare Adi tala varnam of Lalgudi Jayaraman in Tamil, &#8216;Arunodayame,&#8217; in  raga Bhouli, followed by a rare composition of Lakshmanan Pillai in Natta, &#8216;Gananadhane&#8217; set to Adi tala.GNB&#8217;s &#8216;Vinuthapalini&#8217; in  raga Sivasakthi, set to Roopaka tala, paved the way to a subtle exploration of the multi-faceted raga Varali. In Ajith&#8217;s solo, the sancharas were rich in expression and magnitude.The rendition of &#8216;Eti janmamithiha,&#8217; an elegant composition of Tyagaraja set to Misrachappu, with emphasis on  diction, highlighted the musical patterns in the sahithya.Artistic niraval and alluring swarakalpana at the charanam &#8216;Satileni marakotilavanyuni&#8217; was followed by a brief but comprehensive exposition of raga Valachi for &#8216;Santhathamu ninnekori,&#8217; another rare composition of GNB. The hallmark of the concert was the ragam-thanam-pallavi. An erudite exposition of raga Bhairavi documented the innovative sancharas. Thanam was neatly woven into attractive sancharas and Dinesh followed it on the mridangam.The pallavi, &#8216;Kapalini, Thrisoolini, Nathapalini, Athisamanani,&#8217; set to Khandhathriputa (two kala), was appended with ragamalika swaraprasthara in Saraswathi, Kanada and Bindumalini, and sung in two speeds.In the thani, Dinesh made his mark with beats and korvais. A ragamalika &#8216;Mannupukazh Kosalaithan Manivayiril Vazhnthavane,&#8217; comprising Durga, Paras, Saranga Hintholam and Neelambari sent  listeners into a trance. A soulful rendition of the popular &#8216;Ennathavam cheithanai&#8217; in Kapi brought out the feel of the song.The programme was organised by Department of Music, Government College, Chittur, in connection with a three-day national seminar on Carnatic music.
