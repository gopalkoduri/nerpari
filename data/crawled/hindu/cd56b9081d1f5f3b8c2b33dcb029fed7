The novelty lay in the insuperable way he adopted the sublime nuances of carnatic music on to the violin and vice versa. In the process, he innovatively derived strains of varied hues of soul stirring fervour by blending and amalgamating the native charm of the alien instrument and the indigenous music differently in different proportions instantly each time he rendered a concert, Narasimham said.Eminent violinist Kokkanda Subrahmanya Sarma of Angara of E.G. Dist. (former staffer of AIR) who was guest of honour was felicitated on the occasion. He later rendered a violin recital in the company of Narasimham on mridangam. Elegant elaboration ofChakkaniraajamaargamu(Kharaharapriya) of Thyagaraya followed by the expansive thani eruditely executed by Narasimham marked the evening.Bottom Template Starts
