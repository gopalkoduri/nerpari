VKnown for his Tyagaraja bhakti, Radhakrishnan first sang &#8216;Sree Ganapathine&#8217; (Sourashtram-Adi) copy book style. Though his voice was not at its best, Tiruvidaimarudur did well to overcome it and presented sangitham that was touching. Throughout the concert, it was athma bhavam came to the fore rather than vidwat.&#8216;Kana Kana Ruchiraa&#8217; (Varali-Adi ) was the next. The Sriranjani alapana was brief yet authentic. &#8216;Sogasuga&#8217; (Rupakam) was a faithful rendering with minimal kalpanaswaras.Sankarabharanam&#8217;s essence was brought out impressively before &#8216;Emi Naramau&#8217; (Adi) was chosen for rendition.The swaras again were sans any frills. &#8216;Maravairi Ramani&#8217; (Nasikabhushani-Rupakam), kriti without the Tyagaraja mudra, &#8216;Entha Muddo&#8217; (Bindumalini-Adi) and the concluding song Pahi Rama Dhootha (Vasanthavarali-Rupakam) were rich in emotional content, an inherent quality of the saint&#8217;s kritis.Veteran Lakshminarayanan was a tremendous support on the violin, while Thanjavur Ramdoss gave the needed impetus to the concert with his superb playing on the mridangam.
