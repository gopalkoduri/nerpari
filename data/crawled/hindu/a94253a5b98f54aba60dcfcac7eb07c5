VA jugalbandi in Kochi, which featured Ronu Majumdar on the flute in the Hindustani style and Ravikiran on the Chitra veena in the Carnatic style, was an aural treat. Ronu Majumdar of the Maihar gharana delighted the audience with his &#8216;sruti shudha' (clarity in tone) .Meanwhile, Ravikiran left no stone unturned to retain the Carnatic flavour in his presentation. Yet, the coordination, goodwill and reciprocity that the musicians managed to maintain throughout the concert was admirable. The duo also recalled a few words about their first performance together some 15 years ago.Simple improvisationsThe first raga of the evening was Hamsadhwani, and both musicians chose to keep the alaap and other improvisations simple. The composition &#8216;Vathapi Ganapathim' had many surprising turns and both the musicians complemented each other. Keeping abreast with this formidable duo were percussionists K.V. Prasad on the mridangam and Abhijit Banerjee on the tabla, who were together a towering presence in their own right. Their support enhanced the aesthetics of the next number in raga Keeravani by several notches.The raga and cjhala (of Hindustani, akin to tanam) was a revelation of the musicians' immense artistic prowess, variety and style. Usages that centred on &#8216;nishada,' which is the jeeva swara to the raga, was appealing.However, throughout the concert the Hindustani musicians followed their Carnatic counterparts. This was due to the fact that two main ragas of the concert were of Carnatic origin, and the main piece set to Keeravani was in the pallavi format of Carnatic music. Banerjee rose to the challenges set by Prasad and the two together presented a rhythmic exercise that was a comprehensive display of their potential and variety. The programme was devoid of technical hitches, and the stage decor and ambience were exquisite and inspiring.Ronu Majumdar was once again in his element when he presented a stirring Kajri in Misra Khamaj. The abrupt opening of the piece led to a folk number, which was greatly appreciated by the audience.The programme was organised by Dharani society.
