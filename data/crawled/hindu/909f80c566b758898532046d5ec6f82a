VBlessed with a rich and expressive voice, Malayalam playback singer Gayatri Asokan enthralled the audience with her ghazals and geet at Corporation Kalaiarangam, Coimbatore.Arena Expression Group, founded in 1992 by a group of art and theatre enthusiasts of Coimbatore, in association with RmKV Wedding Silks had featured her for the music programme, Aalaap.Having received training in the Hindustani style of singing under Alka Marulkar, she could sing the heavy as well as the light songs with ease.Gayatri's first song, Samajhat naahin, maanat naahin in Maru Behag, set to Vilambit Ek Tal, had a deep touch of classical Hindustani as she presented it with good improvisation and lively swaras.The rest of the songs were the well-known favourites by famous singers.Soft and moving&#8216;Ud Jaa Re Kaaga,' a Meera Bhajan, originally sung by Lata Mangeshkar was soft and moving. Meera's uniqueness could be seen even in the choice of her messenger.Ignoring the swan, the pigeon and the cloud, the usual messengers of love, she requests the crow to carry her message to her Krishna.Gulam Ali's &#8216;Ae Husn Beparwah' and &#8216;Hamko Kiske Gham Ne Mara,' Jagjit Singh's &#8216;Dair O Haram Mein Basne Walo' and Mehdi Hassan's &#8216;Pyar Bhare Do Sharmeele Nain' were some of the songs she rendered with &#233;lan.Gayatri also presented &#8216;Deen Dayalo Rama' (movie-&#8216;Arayannagalu De Veedu'), a bhajan with which she made her entry into the world of play back singing.Gayatri's friendliness and casual approach made the whole experience quite pleasant for herself and the audience. She welcomed requests from the listeners and obliged them to the extent possible.Experienced and skilful accompanists, Roshan Harris (tabla), Prakash Ulleri (harmonium) and Abhijeet (guitar) added to the liveliness of her rendition.
