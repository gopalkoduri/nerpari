VG. JAYAKUMAROutside, it was a depressing evening with an overcast sky and intermittent rain. But inside the Bhajana Mandapam, a different kind of rain lifted the spirits of the gathering, as Thiruvizha Jayashankar breathed life into his nadaswaram. You could call it `nada thein mazha.'Inaugural performanceIt was the opening day of the six-day-long 30th annual Neelakanta Sivan Sangeetha Aradhana, coinciding with the 105th samadhi year of the saint-composer, Neelakanta Sivan. Sri Neelakanta Sivan Sangita Sabha organised the music festival at Sree Vageeswara Swami Japa Dhyana Bhajana Mandapam, Karamana.Thiruvizha Jayashankar, the recipient of this year's Guruvayoor Puraskaram, began his concert with `Mallari,' a jati in Gambhiranatta, which is a dance composition. Next was `Everi' in Abhogi raga, followed by the famous Neelakanta Sivan composition `Anandanatanamaduvar' in Poorvikalyani in which Thiruvizha excelled in bringing forth the elaborate nature of neraval. A composition of Papanasam Sivan, `Karunaidavame,' in Sindhubhairavi was also played with elegance.The concert concluded with a Kavadichinth. Thiruvizha was ably supported by Mahadeva Sarma on the violin, Nanchil Arul on the mridangam and Karthikeyan on the ghatam.The concert was preceded by the observance of a minute's silence in memory of Subramonia Potti, a noted Koodiyattom artiste who died recently.In his keynote address, Dr. V. V. Srivatsa, Secretary, Music Academy, Chennai, pointed outthat Neelakanta Sivan, whose real name was Subramanya, had more than 1,200 compositions to his credit.He was avaggeyakaran, who combined in himself the Bhakti , and Shaiva traditions of the Trinity of Indian music. Distinct from Dikshitar, almost all forms of music, say, Kummi, Kavadichinth could be discerned in his compositions.Bottom Template Starts
