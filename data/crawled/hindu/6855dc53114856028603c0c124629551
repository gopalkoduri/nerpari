VA shower of padhams and javalis kept the audience riveted, as Geetha Raja (and her disciples) presented as many as a dozen of them at the Mahalakshmi Temple Hall, R. A. Puram. Gaanapriya Foundation together with Brhaddhvani had organised the event.Anuradha, Janani, Roja, Sankari, Saranya and Vasumathi were on stage with Geetha. An additional mike or two may have captured the voices of all the singers -- who, it is learnt, are students at The Music Academy.Geetha Raja said that padhams and javalis are known for their long drawn out structures, leisurely pace and graceful raga movements. She added that javalis can be distinguished from padhams by the slightly faster pace they adhere to and the more colloquial language used in the lyrics.Sringara rasa dominatesThe kaarvais and hence the spaces these provide, give the singer abundant scope for modulated rendering. They have been built in rakthi ragas (Khamas, has about 10 ), and scalar ventures (a Dharmavathi or a Needhimathi) are avoided. Sringara Rasa permeates this genre and chapu talam appears to be the favourite of the composers.Though not intended to be a catalogue, the compositions need to be mentioned here. &#8216;Veena Pusthaga Dharini' (Vegavahini, Dikshithar) was the invocation song. A javali in Bhairavi, &#8216;Elararayane Kamini,' came as the first piece. Kshethragnyar's two padhams (&#8216;Baamaro' in Kedaragowlai, &#8216;Aligithe' in Useni) occupied the earlier slots, while Muthu Natesar's &#8216;Ososi' Mukhari) and Subbaramayyar's &#8216;Athuvum Solluval' in Sourashtram were reserved to be sung towards the end.The other composers had their share in this concert, Pattabiramayya with his &#8216;Neematale' (Poorvikalyani), &#8216;Thelise Vagalella' (Bilahari) and &#8216;Enthati Kuluke' (Kalyani), and Dharmapuri Subbarayar's &#8216;Nareemani' (javali in Khamas) &#8216;Smarasundaranga' (in Paras) and &#8216;Sakhiprana' (the cheated one's plaint in Senchurutti). Two Tamil padhams -- Nithirayil (Panthuvarali) and Thiruvotriyur Thyagarajar (Atana) that were sung, were ones authored by Ganam Krishnayyar.Concluding with Shyama Sastri's Sriraga composition &#8216;Karuna Jooda Ninnu,' Geetha also answered a few questions related to these compositions.Geetha has a deep resonant voice which is well-heard especially at the lower registers and her brief alapanas had phrases that affably threaded their way into the songs.Still and serene, Usha Rajagopalan, the accompanying violinist, added to the ambience admirably. Her short Atana alapana had a distinctive flourish. Umayalpuram Mali (mridangam) unleashed nadais that meshed well with this genre.
