VAkkarai Subbulakshmi and Akkarai Swarnalatha presented a violin duet at the Namana Kala Mantapa, accompanied by B. Ravishankar (mridanga) and B. Shashishankar (ghata) in Mysore recently.The young artistes adhered to tradition, always paving a majestic path. Their control over the instrument facilitated smooth and consistent flow of passages.Violinists thrived on sheer competence and artistry, without taking recourse to any deceptive modern gadgets for flashy special effects. It was a deeply ingrained musical vision and well-chiseled dexterity, that worked in singular harmony exerting a long and sustained influence on the listeners.Refinement reigned the entire concert, which started with Swathi Thirunal's (&#8220;Thanjai Vadivelu&#8221;) varna, &#8220;Sarasijanabha&#8221; (Kamboji-attathala). Irrespective of different speeds in which they rendered the composition, the subtleties of the sancharas remained impeccable, and in the process, fine gamakas establishing the desired connectivity between the swaras, sumptuously yielded the expected ineffable experience.Delicacy, command, composure and confidence governed &#8220;Siddhi Vinayakam&#8221; (Shanmukhapriya-Dikshithar), and brought the number, in terms of fervor and import on par with any excellent vocal rendering. The same grit and mood distinctly characterised the swarakalpana section - the framing complementing both the meaning of the lyrics and personality of the raga.Most of the numbers falling between slow to medium speeds; all the components of the compositions were remarkable in consistency. To give a welcome change and a wholesome lift, they included a fast number, &#8220;Atukaradani&#8221; (Manoranjani-Thyagaraja) appending it with a few passages of brisk swaraprastara.Alapana in Lathangi quenched the thirst for decent music. The duo progressively developed Patnam's &#8220;Marivere Dikkevaru&#8221;, richly complementing the composition with elaborate swarakalpana, the patterns never repeating. Both the accompanists held the audience under their sway equalling the lead artistes in dignity, smoothness and fervor.****R.K. Padmanabha sang at Ganabharathi, accompanied by Veena Suresh (violin) and P.S. Shridhar (mridanga).His voice is rich and resilient. The resonance is consistent throughout the range, and as such is tailored for pleasing expressions.He would expatiate the ragas invariably providing them with pauses, and this confirmed his sense of nuances of the ragas. Further, he would progressively expand them systematically beginning with short phrases expanding into movements designed to display admirable latitudes of his imagination and fluency.Hamsadhwani (&#8220;Gam Ganapathe&#8221; - Muthayya Bhagavathar), Dharmavati (&#8220;Paripahimam&#8221; - Veena Subbanna) was especially fluent while expanding the lyrics at &#8220;Sharanagatharthihara&#8221; and Mayamalavagoula &#8220;Kalinarulaku&#8221; &#8211; Vasudevacharya- attractive neraval at &#8220;Sulalithamagu&#8221; followed by sprightly swarakalpana leading to vibrant tani avarthana) were some examples proving his mettle and proficiency.Nevertheless, very frequent employment of tiripa gamakas (sounding like a damaruga) interfered with the lyrical expressions. Simpler approach in delineations would have enhanced the beauty of his imaginations.&#8220;Guruleka Etuvanti&#8221; (Gourimanohari - Thyagaraja), &#8220;Shri Guruguha&#8221; (Devakriya-Dikshithar) and &#8220;Heththa Thaithandegala&#8221; (Hindola-Purandaradasa) were other absorbing pieces that he sang.
