VUP AND coming singer Vaikkom T.V. Jayachandran gave a vocal recital at Ravindra Bharati in Hyderabad recently, on behalf of the South Indian Cultural Association. A disciple of T.M. Thiagarajan, Jayachandran has all the requisites of a promising musician. Usually, he adopts a leisurely approach in his rendition but what he rendered on the occasion was quite methodical.His `Kalyani', for example,  evolved into a melody even as he defined its beauties at every stage. This raga was the major attraction of his show.His repertoire comprised many compositions of Thyagaraja. Giving him support was Ananda on violin, B. Vijay on mridangam and S. Sankar on kanjira.The well-chosen numbers also included a composition of Ramadasu. After invocation to Vinayaka in `Hamsadhwani', he rendered `Nada Tanumanisam' in `Chittaranjani' and also `Srirama Namam' in `Mohana' with a sketch of raga.Both were rendered with devotional appeal but lacked a spirited approach.With his present style sounding more like that of a schoolteacher, it would do the young singer good if he were to add vivacity to his style of presentation.Despite these few drawbacks, his approach to the concert was quite enthusiastic.The supporting artistes on violin and percussions tried their best to leave a positive impact. The `Tani Avartanam', for example was quite lively.The violinist came out with his own version of `Kalyani' that was brief but enjoyable. Jayachandran presented the famous kirtana `Nidhi Chala Sukhama' in this raga.The `Swara Prasthara' he did in this mirrored his imagination. `Himagiri Tanaye' in `Suddha Dhanyasi', `Kamalapta Kula' in `Bridavana Saranga' and `Sankara Srigiri' in `Hamsanandi' were delightful quickies.G.SBottom Template Starts
