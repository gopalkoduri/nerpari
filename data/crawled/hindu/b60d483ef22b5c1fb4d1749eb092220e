VLalgudi Vijayalakshmi led the group, and together with Meera Srinivasan, Mumbai Shilpa, Ranjani, Priyadarshini and Girish seemed to symbolically represent the six faces of Lord Muruga. The voices melded well to delight the audience. The programme commenced with a Lalgudi varnam in Nilambari (a raga not normally preferred for varnam) followed by &#8216;Nee Dhayai Seyyavidil&#8217; (Begada) written and composed by Lalgudi. Arunagirinadhar&#8217;s &#8216;Tiruppugazh&#8217; in praise of the presiding deities of the temples at Tiruttani (&#8216;Edu Budhhi Ayya&#8217;-Misram), Tiruthavathurai &#8212; now known as Lalgudi &#8212; (&#8216;Karaniyum&#8217;-ragamalika-Ekam and Misram), Tiruveezhimizhalai (Behag-Adi) and Swamimalai (Dwijavanthi-Adi),Tirukkazhukundram (&#8216;Veda Veppil&#8217;-Bhimplas- Tisra nadai-Adi) andVallimalai (&#8216;Alli Vizhiyalum&#8217;-Jhonpuri-Adi) were presented. All the compositions   bore the Lalgudi stamp.The last three pieces were those written and composed by Lalgudi V.R. Gopala Iyer, father of Lalgudi G.Jayaraman.The session wound up with &#8216;Kandan Seyalandro&#8217; (Nattakurinji) another  Lalgudi composition, a special request of Y.Prabhu, general secretary, Sri Krishna Gana Sabha.  Ananthakrishnan (veena), Srinivasamurthy (violin), Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar (mridangam) and H. Sivaramakrishnan (ghatam) combined well to embellish the show.The singers&#8217; cohesiveness,  contributed much to the programme&#8217;s success. It&#8217;s time sabhas allot a slot for such thematic presentations, for, the devotional and emotional content is exhibited more in a group concert, and inspires  the rasika to look inward.
