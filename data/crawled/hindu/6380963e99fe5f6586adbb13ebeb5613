VT. K. SADASIVAN"Sitar, for me, is the deepest passion and my constant companion. It is the voice of my soul and humble offering to the Almighty," says the renowned sitarist, Renu Jain.The sitarist was in Aluva recently. Renu Jain was initiated into music at a very young age. She is an artist, sculptor and dancer. But the turning point of her life was a live concert of Pandit Nikhil Banerjee, which she attended in Delhi many years ago. Renu Jain found herself in harmony with the sitar and realised that it was the music of the sitar, which is closest to her heart. Since then she has been a disciple of Pandit Uma Shankar Mishra, a disciple of Pandit Ravi Shankar.The Delhi-based musician heads one of the leading consultancy firm for interiors. Although she is an accomplished interior designer, her priority is always music.  She has participated in many prestigious music festivals, including Festival of India. Her recitals, both in India and abroad are always for charity.Renu Jain delighted the listeners in Aluva with her enchanting recital. Thedhunin `Pahadi' evoked pleasant visuals of a valley. Anotherdhunset to `Sindhu Bhairavi' was also played. Incidentally, both of the dhuns were her own compositions. Renu Jain believes that art is for art sake."Music is so vast like an ocean and what we can gather in a lifetime is few pots of water," she says.Bottom Template Starts
