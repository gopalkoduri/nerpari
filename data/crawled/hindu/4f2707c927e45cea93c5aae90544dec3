VWhat is &#8216;Margazhi Raagam,&#8217; the feature film? Let&#8217;s leave out its yard-long technical credentials. Impressive as they are, what do they mean to the lay listener? No more than what the recipe of a delicacy could represent to one who longs to taste it. Let us also spare the task of going into the experience, background and accomplishments of Jayendra, founder of Real Image; Srikanth of Aghal Films; Sreeram, Sridhar, Rajeevan, Satissh Kurusowa and Venkatakrishna &#8212; all of whom have put their mind and shoulders to this creation &#8212;accomplishments which could humble any of us.What one wished to get  was the taste, the experience. Within seconds of the start of the feature, it generated an electrifying sensation on the viewer-listener. Can the eyes hear, and the ears see, one began wondering, and Margazhi Raagam demonstrated over and over this can happen!If you are relaxed and just sit back and watch what is happening on the big, big screen, you will be wafted by the Music into the same gentle notes from Bombay Jayashree or soar in a whirling motion, churned by that same vibrant voice and pattern of T.M. Krishna, as you come across on the music concert stage, without the slightest effort at emendation, but what is the difference here? Even as Krishna is the Krishna you know, or Jayashree the one you encounter on the stage, and all others appear as you know them, there is that element of realism, fidelity, fullness and presence of every one of them &#8212; be it the tampura, mridangam, ganjira, or violin &#8212; which makes you gasp &#8216;Gosh ! Have I been missing all this, all this time?&#8217;Let&#8217;s dwell a little on the music and its reproduction in specific instances: the deep bassy sound of the left side (or right, for a lefthander like Arun Prakash) of the mridangam is not often noticeably etched; this happens more often as a result of the natural response of the human ear, whose frequency response falls off rapidly below 100 hertz, at which the bass notes sound. This is compensated for by raising the volume and improving the audio system response. A common difficulty faced by the system engineers is that when the former is done, there is almost always acoustic feedback, leading to &#8216;howling&#8217; or &#8216;squealing&#8217; or &#8216;booming.&#8217; One is faced with a Hobson&#8217;s choice. The film  offers bass in plenty, which enhances the mridangam/ganjira experience.You can identify, even without training, Embar Kannan&#8217;s violin sounds as different from Shriram Kumar&#8217;s, even as they play the same notes in the same scale, separately or together. The melody of Jayashree&#8217;s voice is distinct from the timbre of Krishna&#8217;s. The ganjira&#8217;s beats sound true because all its constituent notes come through in proper volume.  The visual appeal contributes a great deal to the listening experience. One saw many examples of this, during the two-hour show : the attention on the face of the singer alone, occupying the whole screen, with the rest of the screen carrying a single colour&#8230;  when the violin played, the camera directed us to look at its bow &#8220;bestriding us like a colossus&#8221; diagonally across the screen, as if to stress the great contribution it is making to the music. If there was effective dramatisation of the fingers on the mridangam and ganjira, there was some dehumanisation in the depiction of the tampura players, which in fact raised aloft the image it left in the mind: the tampura players looked almost immobile; and Emmanuelle Martin exuded the pristine aura of the statue of a Greek goddess in her perfectly erect stance.In a purely subjective sense,  this experience could be savoured very deeply, because there are no distractions while we see and hear all the artists; the relationship is entirely on a one-to-one plane; but how did the artists feel? The eye contact between the artists and a large number of the audience and body language which the artists can notice over a long distance are valuable feedback in the conventional stage. Didn&#8217;t they miss it here?According to Jayendra, the musicians felt  absolutely at ease. The  situation was similar to their singing in the drawing room of their residence, all alone physically, but very much in the company of their preferred co-artists in a psychological or perhaps even spiritual sense. Abandon thus came easily.What prompted the title?&#8220;Margazhi is the month of music and we selected ragas which we think have the widest appeal over the population of music lovers, spanning all classes of mostly interested but uninitiated. Well, Mayamalavagowla (&#8216;Maya teertha-svarupini&#8217;), Ritigowla (&#8216;Janani&#8217;), Varali, Yamunakalyani, Behag, Sama, Begada are all ragas which live up to that description,&#8221; explains Jayendra.Well,  deliberately or by chance, while choosing the title, Jayendra has hit the definition of a Raga in the Sangeeta Ratanakara :Yo sau dhvani-viseshastu svara-varna vibhushita:Ranjako jana-chittanam sa raga: kathito budhai:(That which is adorned by a variety of tones and coloursAnd charms the minds of people is what the wise call raga.)
