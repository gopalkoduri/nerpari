VVocal &#8211; Pandit JasrajMusic &#8211; Kedar Pandit(Rs. 295).The strains of the veena (Narayan Mani), flute (Sandeep Kulkarni) and the chorus in these segments enhance the pieces.A stuti bhajan in Jog has Pt. Jasraj showering swara pushpanjali.Interspersed with pieces on the sarod  sarod (Zarin Daruwala), this bhajan concludes  with the namavali, &#8216;Rama Lakshmana Janaki, Jai Bolo Hanuman Ki,&#8217; lifting one to heights of ecstasy.Perfectly tuned tabla (Kedar Pandit) and pakhavaj (Prakash Sejwal) add value to the CD. The Ashottarashat Namavali presented in  chorus is different from the one in vogue in the south.  Sanskrit research is by Bal Pandit.Hanuman Chalisa has the chorus singing it with devotional fervour. Aarti,  sung alternately by male and female voices, is a fitting finish to the album. Sitar (Umashankar Shukla) and the accompaniment  are noteworthy. Kedar Pandit, a prolific composer, has chosen the right ragas and beats which uplift the listener.The vibraphone (Dhyanesh Deo) and the sruti suddham of the chorus throughout the album are outstanding. Recording engineer Nitin Joshi has done a perfect job of mixing and balancing.A must  for Hanuman devotees.
