VWith  no restriction on  age or experience, anybody who could sing reasonably well and was capable of singing Tamil songs participated. The hall was full with participants and their kith and kin.Freshers like Baby Swetha sang on the same stage where veterans like S.R.Krishnamurthy, Meena Subramaniam and B.S.Shekar presented their fare. Several students from  music schools in and around Coimbatore participated.  Some of the gurus  also sang along with their students.After the nagaswaram recital by Pazhani S. Ramadas and Pazhani M. Sakthivel, Anitha Jayashankar made an auspicious beginning with Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Sri Ganesha Sharanam&#8217; in Tilang. Jayalakshmi Krishnaraj, along with Sangeetha and Sandhya, sang a few thevarams melodiously.Sathyaprakash sang the interesting song, &#8216;Vaangum Enakku Iru Kai Aanaal Arulai Vazhangum Unakko Panniru Kai&#8217;. C.K. Jagadish Prasad presented Thiruvasagam and Radha Sriram sang a few songs of Ambujam Krishna.Mohana Krishnan presented &#8216;Abhiraami Ammai Padhigam&#8217; with her troupe. &#8216;Lalitha Puranam,&#8217; a collection of songs from Nilakanta  Sivan&#8217;s compositions was presented by Anandhi Krishnan.There were instrumental presentations by Kovai Jayashankar (saxophone), Pazhani Sakthivel (shehnai), Bhanumathi (veena), Raghunathan (flute) and Perumal (harmonium).Senior vidwan Krishnaveni, Sirumugai Sivagami, Sriranjani and Brinda Raghu supported the musicians on the violin and Raghu, Radhakrishnan, Ganeshan and Vadasithur Ramachandran provided percussive support on the mridangam (taking turns).Inspired by the aradhanas for Tyagaraja and Purandaradasa, Hariharan, founder of Sadhana Sadhan (popularly known as &#8216;Thiruppugazh Mama&#8217;) started this music festival four years ago.The encouraging response has been growing steadily.According to Hariharan,  the festival that is conducted for three days now may have to be extended for four or five days in the coming years.The fact that more and more rare compositions come to light as students  learn new kritis every year especially for this Tamizhisai Vizha is heartening.
