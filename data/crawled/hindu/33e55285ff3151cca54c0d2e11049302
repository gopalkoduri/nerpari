VMystica MusicUstad Shujaat Husain KhanAudio CD- Rs. 295.Two of the most prominent advocates of Sufism are Sant Kabir and Hazrat Amir Khusro. The mystic poets may have been separated by a century (Khusro was born in 14th century and Kabir, 15th century), but there is a common thread that runs through their poetry&#8230; an expression of the highest philosophy that God is within every man.Hazrat Amir Khusro, a disciple of Nizamuddin Auliya of Delhi, wrote poetry mainly in Persian and Hindavi. He has often been hailed as the &#8216;father of qawwali&#8217; and is credited with introducing Persian and Arabic elements to Hindustani music. His contribution to the development of the ghazal in India is significant. As for Kabir, he truly believed religion is not about rituals but a way of life. His dohas resonate with devotion to God and talk of love of the Supreme kind (&#8216;Moko Kahan Dhundr Re Bande&#8217;).These two Sufi poets have always held the fascination of sitarist Ustad Shujaat Husain Khan, son and disciple of the sitar maestro Ustad Vilayat Khan. That led to the making of &#8216;Unforgettable Sufis,&#8217; a twin CD.The albums feature six poems by Kabir. Check out folksy &#8216;Chunri main pad gayo&#8217;, &#8216;Rehna Nahin Is Desh Mein&#8217; or &#8216;Patta Bola Vriksh Se&#8217; which talks of the transient life of man. The lyrics are laden with such deep meaning that it will take repeated listening to understand the high philosophy.Similarly, Khusro&#8217;s four poems featured speak of love, his most famous being &#8216;Chaap Tilak&#8217; which has been a favourite with almost every great qawaal. What makes the album interesting is that the numbers have been sung by Shujaat Khan himself. And he has a deep voice that is able to effectively convey the mysteries of the world and the longing for communion with God. The ghazals have been set to simple yet endearing tunes. The accent here is on the lyrics and so, the music is not overpowering&#8230; just the guitar (Azaan Khan), flute (Ajay Prasanna), sarangi (Murad Ali) and the rhythm section (Rakesh and Prashant). Of course, the sitar is prominent by its presence, but one sees more of Shujaat Khan the singer rather than the sitar player. The music arrangement has been credited to Upamanya Bhanot, while all the poems have been set to music by Shujaat Khan.SAVITHA GAUTAM
