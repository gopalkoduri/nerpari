VThe third death anniversary of M.S.Subbulaksmi falls on December 11 and it may not be inappropriate to recall a few of her qualities before writing this concert review of her daughter Radha Viswanathan. A voice that can never be forgotten, a charisma unparalleled, a life of nothing but music and bhakti, an icon of Indian womanhood, and a devotee who converted music into a penance, briefly summarise the greatness of M.S. Subbulakshmi.M.S.&#8217;s musical heir Radha Viswanathan, who in her long innings preferred to lend vocal support to her mother in her concerts rather than performing on her own, was a vital force in M.S&#8217;s kutcheris.Radha was featured in the violin vidwan R.K.Venkatarama Shastri&#8217;s centenary celebrations on November 18 with Amritha Murali on the violin and B. Sivaraman on the mridangam. The programme agenda comprised familiar songs often heard in an M.S. concert beginning with the Thodi varnam &#8216;Eranapai&#8217; in Adi Talam. Tyagaraja&#8217;s Nalinakanti kriti &#8216;Manaviyalakinchara&#8217; preceded a brief raga alapana of Poorvikalyani and Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Gnanamosakaradha&#8217; embellished with niraval and swaras that were convincing efforts. &#8216;Deva deva&#8217; in Mayamalavagowla, that is popular in the Semmangudi repertoire, kept the audience interest sustained.A beautiful composition of Yoga Narasimham, &#8216;Sada Saranga Nayane,&#8217; in Ranjani with its imaginative chittaswaram, was rendered with striking fervour.Sankarabharanam was elaborated methodically, effectively communicating the swaroopa of the raga with pertinent prayogas. Subbarama Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Sankaracharyam&#8217;, niraval and kalpanaswaras set the platform for the mridanga tani avartanam played with praiseworthy laya proficiency. The end pieces &#8216;Akhilandeswari&#8217; (Dikshitar) in Dwijavanti, Sri Ramachandra (Tulsidas) in Sindhubhairavi, &#8216;Bhavayami Gopala Balam&#8217; (Annamacharya) in Yamuna Kalyani, &#8216;Jagadhodarana&#8217; (Purandaradasa) in Kapi, &#8216;Kuraionrumillai&#8217; (Rajaji) and Kanchi Paramacharya&#8217;s &#8216;Maithreem Bhajatha&#8217; proved that the singer&#8217;s focus and commitment were absolutely intact. Amritha Murali, the violinist, has made impressive inroads as a sensitive, supportive accompanist, and she reinforced that assessment in Radha&#8217;s concert.This review would not be complete if the oral assistance provided by Radha&#8217;s grand daughter Aishwarya Srinivasan is not given due recognition. A dulcet, perfectly sruti aligned voice with a stunning extraordinary range and confident effortless expression are worthy attributes indicative of a rising star in the firmament.Despite the passage of time, severe health problems and a recalcitrant voice, if Radha was able to remind rasikas of the fragrance of yore it was her all consuming passion for the art.
