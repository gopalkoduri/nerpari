VR. Sreedev from Kerala\u000apresented a vocal concert\u000aat the Seva Sadana\u000aHall, Malleswaram, on\u000athe August 30, as part of Kalothsava\u000a08, organised by\u000aAnanya and the Department\u000aof Youth Services and Sports.\u000aThe accompanists were Kottayam\u000aV.G. Upendranath (violin),\u000aChanganasseri K.R.\u000aJayan (mridanga), and Trivandrum\u000aR. Rajesh (ghata).The navaragamalika varna\u000ain adi tala, the first item, was\u000afollowed by the Deekshitar\u000akrithi "Swaminatha" in Nattai\u000aand adi tala, to which were\u000aappended copious kalpana\u000aswaras. Thyagaraja's "Niravadhisukhada"\u000ain Ravichandrika\u000aplaced a greater\u000aemphasis on raga bhava than\u000aon speed, as did the alapana of\u000aArabhi, "Juthamurare" in rupaka\u000atala, and the ensuing\u000akalpana swaras. "Ramanamamu"\u000ain Athana was succeeded\u000aby a beautiful alapana of Kalyani\u000aand "Ammaravamma"\u000ain khanda chapu tala, with neraval\u000aat "Tamarasadalanetru"\u000aand energetic kalpana swaras.\u000a"Kamalapthakula", in Brindavanasaranga,\u000aprovided a\u000afine contrast in tempo and\u000amood.Bhairavi, the main raga of\u000athe evening, was taken up for\u000aa well-contoured elaboration\u000awithin the prescribed classical\u000aparameters, with heavy\u000agamakas and leisurely rests at\u000athe madhya sthayi panchama\u000aand tara sthayi shadja. The\u000aThyagaraja krithi "Upacharamulanu"\u000ain adi tala was\u000asung with due consideration\u000ato the gravity of its form and\u000asubstance.Nevertheless, the possibility\u000aof a more enriching experience\u000awas negated by the\u000aomission of the neraval at kapata\u000anataka, from where a series\u000aof kalpana swaras based\u000aon good rhythmic skills was\u000alaunched, followed by an\u000aebullient tani avarthana.The violin accompaniment,\u000awhile competent, could have\u000asynchronised better with the\u000avocalist's style. A soulful "Devan\u000ake pati", Swathi Thirunal's\u000acomposition in Darbari\u000aKanada, and "Vinayakuni" in\u000aMadhyamavathi were the\u000aconcluding items.The concert revealed R.\u000aSreedev's steadfast adherence\u000ato classicism with a pronounced\u000aaccent on melody,\u000amoulded by a soft voice. However,\u000athe high volume levels of\u000athe accompanying instruments\u000acould have been balanced\u000amore evenly to match\u000athat of the vocalist, thereby\u000aenhancing listening pleasure.****Kalothsava 2008 is a laudable\u000ainitiative launched by\u000athe cultural organisation\u000aAnanya in association with\u000athe Department of Youth Services\u000aand Sports to showcase\u000ayoung musical talent from\u000aKarnataka and the neighbouring\u000astates.Though Ananya has conducted\u000aseveral programmes\u000ain the past specifically for\u000ayoung artistes, Kalothsava\u000awas started this year with the\u000adual purpose of providing\u000athem with opportunities to\u000aperform, and encouraging interaction\u000abetween musicians\u000abelonging to different regions.\u000aThe vocalists featured this\u000ayear were Pattabhirama Pandit\u000aand G. Ravi Kiran from\u000aKarnataka, R. Raghavendra\u000afrom Tamil Nadu, R. Sreedev\u000afrom Kerala and V.G. Guha\u000afrom Andhra Pradesh.\u000aAccording to Dr. Raghavendra,\u000aManaging Trustee of\u000aAnanya, exposure to developing\u000atrends and standards in\u000aother states is as important as\u000alistening to top ranking and\u000awell-established artistes.The process begun now\u000acould yield results in a few\u000ayears time, not only for the\u000aperformers this year but also\u000afor the aspiring musicians in\u000athe audience.Dr. Raghavendra feels that\u000athe response from the latter\u000acategory was lukewarm in\u000aterms of attendance at the\u000aconcerts, but hopes to continue\u000athe venture in coming\u000ayears with greater media participation\u000aand a more streamlined\u000aselection procedure.
