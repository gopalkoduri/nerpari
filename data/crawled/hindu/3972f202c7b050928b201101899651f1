VR.A. Ramamani's concert at Sri Kannika Parameshwari Temple, Malleshwaram, under the aegis of Nadajyothi Sri Thyagarajaswamy Bhajana Sabha filled the air with her robust voice and her felicitous odyssey into the mandra, madhya, and tara sthayis. Her elaborate Abhogi alapana filled the air. She sang Devagandhari ("Vinarada na manavi") and Shankarabharana ("Saroja dala netri"). She gave a profound treatment of large artistic proportions to the manodharma exercises. She was aptly backed up by C.N. Chandrasekhar (violin), V. Krishna (mridanga), and T.N.Ramesh (ghata).Good stage presenceYoung Lakshmi Basavaraj, who gave a Bharatanatya recital at the Nayana auditorium under the Every Wednesday Cultural Evening Programme Series, had an attractive stage presence. Her postural control was good and in the Shabda (ragamalika), she showed a capacity for mobile expressions. The greatness of Lord Shiva was mimed with exuberance by depicting Parvati Kalyana, Amritha Manthana and other episodes. The Shankarabharana varna ("Deena bandhu") eulogising Lord Krishna was in perfect coherence with rhythm and her half-seated posture was well articulated. A series of episodes connected with Lord Krishna were portrayed in a nutshell. Her abhinaya for different lines drawn from different padas of Purandaradasa strung together imparted a collage effect. It evoked mixed reactions. The musical support from the wings was lent by her guru B.K.Vasanthalakshmi (nattuvanga), Bharathi Venugopal (vocal), Gurumurthy (mridanga) and Mahesh (flute).M.
