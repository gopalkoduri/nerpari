VG. JAYAKUMARThe seven-day Swati Sangeethotsavam 2007 saw noted musicians enchantingrasikaswith a variety of compositions of Kerala's royal composer Swati Tirunal. The music festival is fittingly held year after year in the courtyard of the Kuthiramalika in Thiruvananthapuram.The opening day's concert was presented by Sanjay Subramanyan who displayed his prowess in voice modulation.  Sanjay started off with `Sarojanabha' in Chakravakom set to Adi tala and followed it with `Parvathy nayaka' in Bouli. The main attraction was `Mamava ashrutha' in Bhavapriya, which he rendered with an elaborate raga vistaram. The thaniavarthanam witnessed musical fireworks at the hands of K. Arun Prakash on the mridangam, S. Karthick on the ghatam and Payyanur T. Govindaprasad on the morsing. M. R. Gopinath accompanied on the violin. .Sanjay also rendered `Palaya Deva Deva' (Bhairavi), `Jagadeesa' (Nattakurinji), `Bhogeendrasayinam' (Kuntavarali), `Visweswara Darsana Karo,' and concluded with `Bhujagasayino' (Yadukulakambhoji).Devotional compositionsRama Varma's concert the next day was notable for his rendering of Swati Tirunal's devotional compositions. One of the kritis he sang was `Paramananda mam pahi' in Kedaram eulogising Lord Siva of Sreekanteswara Temple in Thiruvananthapuram.He also presented a kriti `Nandasudha tava jananam' in   Rohini, composed by his guru M. Balamuralikrishna. The rendering had a Hindustani flavour. He chose Sankarabharanam for the main item of the evening. The kriti was `Devi jagat janani.' The other compositions included `Aaj aye syam mohan' (Pahadi), `Paramapurusham' (Lalithapanchamam), and `Japathe Japathe,' a bhajan in the ragamalika form.On the third day of the festival,  S.K.S. Hariharasubramanian showed his enthusiasm by stretching his  concert to over four hours. Maintaining the pure classicist style, he reproduced a rich repertoire of Swati Tirunal's compositions. He began his concert with `Deva Deva Kalayamithe' in Mayamalavagoula set to Roopaka tala. He followed it with `Paripalayamam' in Ritigoula. Rama Rama Guna Seema' in Simhendramadhyamam, set to Adi tala, exemplified his classical knowledge. S.K.S also sang `Sarasijanabha murare' (Todi), `Mamavasada janani'(Kanada), `Jaya Jaya Devi' (Yamunakalyani), `Visweswar Darsana Karo' and a tillana in Dhansree.T.M. Krishna brought to fore his expertise in manodharma sangeetham, especially through the rendering of the effervescent Kalyani and the kriti was `Enthu cheyvu njan.'The high point of his kutcheri was `Pahi janani' in Nattakurinji, wherein he delineated the intricacies of the raga.The star attraction of Sangeetha Sivakumar's concert was the kriti `Pankajalochana' in Kalyani. It was marked by gamaka prayogas and smooth swara sancharam. She also rendered the well-known `Deva Deva Kalayamithe' in Mayamalavagoula, `Narasimhamamava' in Arabhi, `Sumasayaka' (Sudhakappi), `Bhogeendrasayinam' (Kuntavarali), `Saramaina' and `Bhujagasayino.'The penultimate day of the music festival was set apart for the Hindustani compositions of Swati Tirunal. Pandit Ganapathi Bhatt and party mellifluously sang these. It was amazing how Ganapathi Bhatt sustained his voice quality moving to higher octaves, without diluting the bhava of the kriti.Veena recitalTrichy B. Sivakumar was the lone instrumentalist who performed in the festival. He follows the gayaki tradition in veena playing.Sivakumar began his veena recital with `Karunakara' in Begada set to Rupaka talam. `Gopanandana' in Bhooshali was absorbing. `Rama Rama Guna Seema' in Simhendramadhyamam started with a ragavistaram followed by thanam and moved to the kriti.Trichy B. Sivakumar also played `Mamava sada janani' (Kanada), `Krupayapalaya Shoure' (Charukesi), `Pahi Parvatha Nandini,' a Navarathri kriti in Arabhi, `Visweswar Darsana Karo' (Sindhubhairavi), `Panchasayaka' (Neelambari), `Saramaine' (Behag), and a tillana in Dhansree. He concluded his veena concert with a mangalam in Yadukulakambhoji.Earlier, the veena concert was preceded by a Sangeetha Aradhana by students of the Department of Music, University of Kerala. The Swati Sangeethotsavam was a success in terms of the recitals and the large crowd present on each day of the concert.Bottom Template Starts
