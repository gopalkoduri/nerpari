VSouth Indian Cultural Association's annual music fest concluded with Sudha Raghunathan's vocal recital and she regaled her fans with a chain of favourite ragas like Dhanyasi, Jayantisree, Simhendra Madhyamam, Shanmukhapriya , Khambhoji and so on.Her virtuosity was unquestionable and her alapanas bore ample testimony to this fact. She delves into the raga in full strength, churns out the essence and presents it to us. Her diction is lucid and her technical prowess, like sruti bedham has been long established. The concert only reiterates this.While the Thyagaraja kriti Maryaada kadayya&#8230; flowed easy, the Shyama Sastri kriti Meena lochana&#8230; in Dhanyasi following an elaborate alapana, established her style &#8211;intellectual, racy and technically perfect. Sudha is at the fulcrum of classicality with a timbre and tone that has the sharpness of steel and never wavers at any point of time. The Asainthadum mayil&#8230; a Tamil composition in Simhendra Madhyamam was tinged with the raciness that suited the lyric and the vocalist's rendition added glitter to this beautiful kriti. Sadaashraye abhayambike &#8230; in Shanmukhapriya (Chamaram: 56th mela in the asampurna scale) a very esorteric kriti was treated with her trademark alapana, by now so evident and the neraval at Chidaashraye&#8230; was extensive as was the manodharma. Given her ingenuity, these lines were very conducive to inserting a yati, at precisely this point, but we were a tad disappointed. This fairly lengthy charanam turned into a technically fast-paced finishing line.The ragamalika (Kambhoji, Mohana and Brundavana Saranga with the pallavi recitation of verse was the highlight of the evening. The shifting of ragas between the dhrutam and lagu was a creditable piece of artistry. The sama eduppu (from 2 -1) showcased her virtuosity. It was a recital of methodological skills in tala and raga with creative intelligence at its peak. Going by the capacity audience of Ravindra Bharati it's not an exaggeration to state that Sudha Raghunathan is definitely a crowd-puller. B. Raghavendra Rao on the violin, T.Vaidyanathan on the mridangam and R. Raman on the morsing gave fitting accompaniment.
