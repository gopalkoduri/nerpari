VG. SWAMINATHANYouth is full of energy and vigour. Accepted. What matters is how these elements are exploited. Abhishek Raghuram's voice has pleasantly matured but sadly, not the mode of presentation. He still seems to be a restless singer.Raghuram had to satisfy himself with just an hour's concert as the awards presentation ceremony of Sri Ragam Fine Arts at Raga Sudha Hall swallowed up 45 minutes of the concert time."Sabapathikku Veru Deivam'' in Abhogi was indeed a good start. Abhishek gave an outline of Vachaspathi for "Parathpara Parameswara."High accelerationThe neraval at "Hari Ayanum Kaana Ariya Jothi" and the follow-up of swaras went on high acceleration. So did the alapanawhile the kalpanaswara segments were turned into frenzied chains.There was no pause for a breather till the Saveri kriti, "Muruga Muruga" which came as a whiff of fresh breeze. But the respite was shortlived. Abhishek started belting out Suddha Saveri with minimum repose and maximum roll-ons. "Dharini Telusu Konti" provided extra scope for him to race through. The kriti does allow a sensible way of building up sangatis; but Abhishek's obsession with speed threw ignored the option.Abhishek Raghuram's well-groomed voice and training could be put to better use with slow, steady and more systematic style.B. Sivaraman   played his role on the mridangam with encouraging beats that flew about like sparks. V.V.Srinivasa Rao on the violin was just a prop in the jangle.Bottom Template Starts
