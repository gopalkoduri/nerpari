VThe creativity of any artiste lies in exploring the unknown  and presenting it effectively and efficiently. This was proved true by V. R. Dileep Kumar during his  concert at Nadopasana, Irinjalakuda.The opening Kedaragowla varnam was followed by a salutation to Lord Ganesha, &#8216;Vallabha nayakasya&#8217; in Begada. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Maa kelara, adorned with elegant kalpanaswaras, reminded one of the Semmangudi bhani.An elaborate aalapana of Dwijavanthi portrayed the serene beauty of that raga. The kriti &#8216;Akhilandeswari&#8217; followed.This was followed by another Dikshitar composition, a Panchalingasthala kriti &#8216;Jamboopathe&#8217; in Yamunakalyani, addressing the lord of Thiruvanaikkavu.Dileep Kumar&#8217;s clear diction enriched his rendition.  His rendering was  proof of his command and control over the laya and he was able to imbue each kriti with saahithya bhaava as well as sangithabhava. Swati&#8217;s &#8216;Saadaramava&#8217; in Saraswathy and Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Sreenivasa&#8217; in Hamsanandi stood out as they contrasted with the pace of the earlier  Vilambhakaala kritis.However the piece de resistance was the elaboration of Sudha saveri. Starting with a slow pace, in perfect conformity to the kriti to be followed (Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Darini Telusukonti&#8217;), he scaled through the contours of that raga, painting a neat and clear picture that portrayed the various stages of its evolution.The kriti praising the Goddess Thripurasundari (Thiruvottiyur pancharathnam) was neatly rendered with neraval and manodharma swara passages.The final phase of the concert comprised a javali &#8216;Vagaladi&#8217; in Behag, &#8216;Karunai deivame&#8217; in Sindhu Bhairavi and &#8216;Eppo Varuvaro&#8217; in Jaunpuri. Edappaly Ajith Kumar was excellent on the violin and his  delineation of Dwijavanthi and Sudhasaveri needs special mention.Thiruvananthapuram R.Vaidyanathan accompanied on the mridangam. He  played a crisp tani along with Mangad Pramod on the ghatam.
