VA vocal concert by Vidya Kalyana Raman, accompanied by T.S. Krishna Murthy (violin), B.S. Prashanth (mridanga) and G.S. Nagaraj (kanjira) was hosted by the Malleswaram Sangeetha Sabha, Bangalore, recently.The performance began on a conventional note with &#8220;Sarasuda&#8221;, the adi thala varna in Saveri, and Purandaradasa's &#8220;Jayajayajaya Janakikantha&#8221; set to Natta raga and khanda chapu thala, ornamented with a few kalpana swaras. The alapana of Reethigaula that followed was meticulous, suffused with raga bhava and bedecked with fine touches. Mysore Vasudevacharya's &#8220;Mama Hridaye Vihara&#8221; was presented with due emphasis on the lilting cadence of the lyrics and reinforced with a fine neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Mandahasa Vadana&#8221;. A striking contrast in tempo and mood was induced with a leisurely rendering of the Deekshithar krithi in Lalitha raga and rupaka thala, &#8220;Hiranmayeem Lakshmeem&#8221;, and a bracing &#8220;Sarasa Samadana&#8221; in Kapinarayani, leading up to the main raga of the evening, Kalyani.The alapana progressed in a series of appealing gamaka laden sancharas adhering to the identity of the scale as prescribed by tradition. A keen aesthetic sense was evident, for instance, in the panchama and shadja varjya usages around the nishada in anticipation and leading up to the thara shadja. Though the strength and volume of the voice appeared rather diminished in the thara sthayi, clarity and flexibility were maintained. &#8220;Nambi Kettavarillavo&#8221; in mishra chapu thala was supplemented with a well contoured and technically sound neraval and fluent kalpana swaras in two speeds at &#8220;Garudagamana&#8221;, with prompt and expert support from the accompanying artistes.&#8216;Allied Ragas 10' was presented by S. Shankar, ably accompanied by S. Sheshagiri Rao (violin), M.T. Rajakesari (mridanga), and supported by his disciples Arjun, Shashidhara, Krishna and Karthik, under the auspices of Ananya. The ragas taken up for comparative study were Bilahari, Deshakshi and Maand.The major part of the session was devoted to Bilahari, in consonance with the raga's importance, popularity and scope. The audava-sampoorna scale derived form Dheerashankarabharanam with the kaishiki nishada constituting its bhashanga attribute, was explained, and datu, janta and other sancharas highlighted. Veena Kuppiers's varna &#8220;Intha Chouka&#8221; incorporating several unusual melodic combinations, Mysore Vasudevacharya's varna &#8220;Chalamela&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Kanukontini&#8221;, Deekshithar's &#8220;Ekadantham&#8221; and Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer's &#8220;Paridanamichithe&#8221; were among the compositions sung. The lead artiste's alapana, followed by Mysore Vasudevacharya's &#8220;Sri Chamundeshwari&#8221; in adi thala, suffixed with an evocative neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Raka Nishakara Sannibhavadane&#8221; and a brief thani avarthana, demonstrated the range, beauty and classicism inherent in both raga and composition.It was explained that while the arohana of Deshakshi is similar to that of Bilahari, the avarohana employs the kaishiki nishada, categorising it as a janya of Harikamboji. The softer nuances characteristic of the raga, its emphasis on the second half of the madhya sthayi and upwards, and in particular the jaru glide of the nishada, were elucidated and amply illustrated in the rendering of Oothukkadu Venkatasubbaier's &#8220;Santhatham Aham Seve&#8221; and Swathi Thirunal's &#8220;Sarasiruhanabham&#8221;.The different shades of Maand, an import from the Hindustani idiom, were demonstrated chiefly through Vasudevacharya's &#8220;Janakimanoharam&#8221; and Lalgudi Jayaraman's thillana.
