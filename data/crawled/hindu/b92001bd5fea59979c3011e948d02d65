VThe concert started with the famous Bhairavi Varnam inata talaand was followed byvallbhanayakasyainbegada. Thekalapramanamfor thekrithiswas ideal and conveyed thebhavawell. Similarly thekrithi thelisiramainpoorna chandrilkahad a dignified march unlike the contemporary way of unholy speed that is so prevalent. Garudagamana innagaswaravali,annapoorne visalakhsiinsamawere impressive. Kalayani was taken up for elaboration that was accompanied bythanamand thekrithis ninnuvana. The concert came to a close with attractive tailenders including ajavali.Padma was ably assisted on the veena by Vidya Ramaraj, whose contribution was very helpful. Vidya Sagar played the mridangam; his input was rather limited and essentially mechanical. One cannot help in a situation where there is not enough opportunity and scope for innovation. In short it was a reasonably good concert that could give adequate pleasure to the common listener.
