VThe saxophone artiste Kadri Gopalnath was accompanied by four percussionists: mridanga (Hari Kumar); tabla (Rajendra Nakod); khanjira (Amruth N.) and morsing (Rajashekar). But not once, at the concert at Chamarajpet Ramaseva Mandali last week, was there any instance of percussion overtaking melody. Gopalnath is indeed brave to go to a concert with such a strong percussive set. &#8220;The tabla brought about a dynamic character to the overall effect. Since both my saxophone and Kanyakumari's violin have high-end contact mikes, the balancing became uncomplicated,&#8221; said Gopalnath.The sharpness of the morsing added to the drama. What one observed was that there was a perfect understanding not only between the percussionists, but also the way they complemented the sensibilities of the sax and violin.The thani avartha was the highlight of the entire concert. The patterns that emerged were fascinating and engaging as well. The morsing excelled and provided a delightful experience.RANJANI GOVIND****The sisters, the divas of Carnatic music, presented rare ragas: Lathangi, Nasikabhushini, Manirangu, and Poornachandrika. Their exceptional imagination coupled with an amazing felicity of voice leaves the listener overwhelmed; the sisters are brimming with ideas and negotiate their complex manodharma with an exceptional ease.&#8220;Mara Vairi Ramani&#8221; in Nasikabhushini was racy, yet fervent. &#8220;Lokavana Chatura&#8221;, Tyagaraja's kriti in Begade had an interrupted flow &#8212; in the alapana, neraval and the svaraprasthara. Raga Tana Pallavi in raga Varamu (Shuddha Hindola) was the masterpiece of the concert. Ranjani's profound elaboration in the lower and middle octaves was followed by a passionate delineation by Gayatri in the upper octaves. Ranjani's dynamic presentation painted a vivacious picture of the raga and Gayatri's meditative, long phrases punctuated with silences brought out a contrasting image of the raga quite compellingly.Poongulam Subramanyam on the mridangam, M.A. Krishna Murthy on the ghatam and Ganesh Prasad on the violin elevated the concert. But truly, what an audience! It was the quintessential, large-hearted, committed Kannada audience that passionately receives all that is exceptional. And the sisters basked in the adulation.DEEPA GANESH****Malladi means music, and Vasavi, sister of the Malladi Brothers (Sriram Prasad and Ravi Kumar) proved it this week in the junior series.The Malladi style takes a different path in trying new ragas but does not cross the golden line of the melakarta repertoire as they &#8216;offer a complete range for expansion'.Vasavi took up Bhairavi for Tyagaraja's &#8220;Enatinomu Palamu&#8221; and brought in some interesting elucidation in her neraval. As the Pinakapani tradition has it, she came up with a mukthayi swara-kalpana that weaved in some enjoyable calculations devoid of the usual frenzied wrap up.With H.S. Venkatesh on the mridanga and Anuthama Muralidhara on violin, Vasavi's outline of Atana and Pantuvarali spoke of her schooling.R.G.
