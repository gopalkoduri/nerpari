VMarking the 599th Jayanthi of Annamayya, Sujanaranjani organised a two day festival at its venue, Hanuman Devasthanam, in the complex. The festival featured young and talented vocalist Duddu Radhika, in an exclusive vocal recital on the first day. The second day was allotted to young talent, numbering around 20 artistes, but formed into three groups for a chorus rendition of the chosen songs of great Padaakavita Pitamaha.Duddu Radhika appeared to have prepared herself well for the event and tried her best to select compositions of Annamacharya that accommodate classical element of rendition too. In fact Annamacharya compositions are more sahitya-oriented and suitable music is to be chosen to present it meaningfully, as a vehicle to convey.Radhika chose devotional numbers for display of her classical strength inragadelineation andswaraprasthara, to make her listeners to also enjoy that classical flavour too. Her repertoire was a mix of popular an\u000ad freshly composedkirtanasand had a full fledged orchestral support that classical concert requires of two percussion instruments and of course violin accompaniment- S.V. Ramana murthy on violin, Kapa Srinivasa Rao on mridangam and J\u000aanardan on ghatam respectively. Most of the numbers she sang have been set to music by Nedunuri Krishna Murthy. She madePoorvikalyanias her mainragaeffort and rendered it with comfort. She also used the numberGhummani Shruti, for the presentation ofSwaraprasthara.Radhika did not lose the sight of the richsahitya bhavaof kritis of Annamayya. The opening number was a salutation to Lord Venkateswara -PurushothamudaveevuinRevagupti. Cheri YasodainMohana, RamachandrudithaduinDwijavanthi, Adideva ParamatmainSindhu Bhairavi, Joachyutananda, a popular lullaby, inKapi , Bhavayami GopalabalaminYaman Kalyanwere the most enjoyable numbers from her.On the second day young artistes of a music institutes formed into groups and rendered a good number of compositions of Annamacharya.
