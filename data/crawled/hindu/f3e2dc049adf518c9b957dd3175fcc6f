VS. AISHWARYADetailed raga alapanas, well-structured niraval and fitting song selections made Geetha Bennett's veena concert an enjoyable experience for the audience.  The concert, held at Rasika Ranjana Sabha, Tiruchi, recently, was rich with the inclusion of vocal sangathis and bhava.Geetha took up "Sri Raga" varnam as the inaugural piece, which was followed by "Gurulekha" in Gowrimanohari.Her deft fingers tastefully captured verses from "Vinaradhana" in Deva Ghandhar and "Vijayambike" in Vijayanagari.Her brief preface to the songs before every presentation did help the listeners.  Geetha held the audience captive by addressing them and singing quite a few numbers in between, a knack she learnt from Pt. Ravishankar and Maharajapuram Santhanam.  An instant rapport was created with the listeners who appreciated her alapanas.Other numbers she placed before the audience were Bharathi's "Vedipadu" in Mohanam, her father &#151;  Guru S. Ramanathan's "Nin Malaradi" set to Megaranjani, "Dorakuna" in Bilahari and the tailpiece Subramania Bharathi's "Theeradha Vilaiyattu Pillai."Her wrapping up Thillana piece in Nagaswarali, composed by her husband Frank Bennett, was captivatingly crisp. It was a concert in memory of her father and Geetha Bennett played that evening with her commanding eloquence in tone and firmness in meetu.R. Govindarajan on the violin, Nirmal Narayanan on the mridangam and R. Renganathan on the ghatam ably accompanied her, maintaining the tempo in admirable fashion.Bottom Template Starts
