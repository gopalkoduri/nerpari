VThe vocal concert by Maharajapuram S. Ramachandran, under the auspices of Manoranjitham, the cultural wing of Ayyappa Puja Sangam, Coimbatore, was a treat for the listeners. The Kanada varnam, `Neranammithi' laid the foundation for a three-hour long aural treat. After a brief alapana in Chakravaham, Ramachandran sang a rare composition by Mangalam Ganapathy,  `Sakala loka jana vanditha varadam.' `Guruguha swamini Bhaktim karomi' in Bhanumathi by Dikshitar was a rare kriti that delighted the listeners.Oothukkadu Venkatasubbaiyar's Kambodhi kriti,  `Kuzhaloodhi manamellam' was followed by an elaborate  Kalyani and `Enduku nee manasu karagathu' by Tyagaraja with due emphasis to the sahitya drenched in karuna rasa.Purandaradasa's `Ksheerabdhi Kannige, Sri Mahalakshmi' in Ragamalika was an incredible blend of the beauty of the sahitya and total devotion. Ramachandran also sang a devout song `Anbaal unnaippaadinen Ayyappa' by Swarna Venkatesha Dikshitar. The speciality of the composition was that each line started with a Tamil vowel. Before concluding with his usual `Bho Shambho', the artiste sang a lovely virutham in Ragamalika describing the response of the birds and animals when Krishna played on his flute, and burst into `Anandaamrutha karshini' in Amruthavarshini.The alapanas, neravals and swaraprastharas were elaborate or brief according to the need of the kriti and never exceeded the limit.M. R. Gopinath's nimble fingers danced on the violin with speed and dexterity. Mannargudi Easwaran enjoyed  playing on the mridangam throughout the concert and during the `thani' he proved his class.B.
