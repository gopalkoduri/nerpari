VPeriasami Thooran is one of the last century&#8217;s noted composers. He was  a multifaceted personality who was a writer, journalist, lyricist, and story teller. Besides, he put together  the first encyclopaedia (&#8216;Kalai Kalanjiyam&#8217;) in Tamil. The programme organised by Brahma Gana Sabha at the Sastri Hall, was dedicated to Periasami Thooran and young Amrutha Venkatesh gave a concert which showcased some of the popular kritis from his 200-odd compositions.Amrutha&#8217;s voice is not robust but husky. This is compensated by her range of creativity especially in her ability to build up raga images. They are simply bold and beautiful. In this programme, her focus  was on Begada, Saveri and Keeravani.Amrutha took sometime to stabilise and Begada was rather too short for comments. Nevertheless, Amrutha&#8217;s sancharas travelled like a  kite flying high and low with definite expressions. Her phrases were never too short but extensive, pivoting on a note and circling over it on varying levels steadily and progressively. Amrutha&#8217;s technique is definitely fascinating because she at no instance sacrifices the melody. Saveri and Keeravani were strikingly structured with many segments linked with aesthetic loops and pliant passages.In Saveri, her choice went for Thooran&#8217;s famous composition &#8216;Muruga muruga endral&#8217; with a slow set niraval  on the line &#8216;Senthil malayil vazhum&#8217;. Keervani was built on many layers of fine phrases in lower and upper regions through proper connectivity. &#8216;Punniyam oru koti purindeno&#8217;, a kriti in praise of Sankaracharya and the detailing on &#8216;Annai kamakshi poale anbe vadivai vandai&#8217; was well developed. &#8216;Gana nathane&#8217; in Saranga, &#8216;Harihara sudane iyyappa&#8217; in Abohi, &#8216;Ethanai taram sonnalum&#8217; in Begada, &#8216;Samagana priye&#8217; in Anandabhairavi and &#8216;Thaye tripurasundari&#8217; in Suddha Saveri were the other numbers that filled the rest of the concert.Amrutha with all her favourable points should give importance for an even tempo; this programme gave an impression of being too leisurely one. Even fast numbers such as &#8216;Thaye triupurasundari&#8217; lacked the usual dash.L. Ramakrishnan on the violin was not just a prop but contributed substantially with his serious and sensitive responses in the main ragas. He scored in his delineations of Begada and Saveri. Nellai A Balaji on the mridangam gave a perfectly matching rhythmic support.
