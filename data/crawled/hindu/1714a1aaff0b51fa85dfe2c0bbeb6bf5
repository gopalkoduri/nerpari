VThe centenary celebration of G.N.Balasubramaniam held under the auspices of the Indian Fine Arts Society, was marked by a recital by Sangeetha Sivakumar.GNB was noteworthy for introducing a new era of kutcheri presentation that bridged the traditional and the contemporary. His vidwat was deployed to convey music&#8217;s perpetual joy.In pursuit of this ideal, his alapanas had a well thought-out design. He brought out arresting images of a raga determined to capture in his brigas the sparkle and splendour of sancharas.GNB&#8217;s influence over the next generation rested on his astonishing ability to visualise the unexplored richness of a raga. These aspects are replete in his compositions.Sangeetha Sivakumar, with verve, vibrancy and vitality in interpreting GNB&#8217;s kirtanas, emphasised that the vidwan&#8217;s style still held the field. She very ably reflected the bhani keeping in view her objective.  The composer&#8217;s stamp in the ragas and kirtanas was preserved. Sangeetha drew out  the niceties and nuances of the pieces which she chose.Kiravani (&#8216;Nee Charanambujamunu&#8217;) and Arabhi (&#8216;Maravanune Ninnu&#8217;) were selected for alapanas. While Arabhi had glittering sanchara combinations, speedy movement with good balance and pleasurable phrasings dotted the Kiravani vinyasa. In both, she revealed that passion was not lacking in purpose.&#8216;Parama Kripaa Saagari&#8217; in Yadukula Khambodi represented GNB&#8217;s hand in composure and poise, and Sangeetha did full justice to it. &#8216;Saraswathy Namosthuthe&#8217; (Saraswathy) and &#8216;Kamala Charane&#8217; (Amrita Behag) had a lilting gait.In violinist Akkarai Subhalakshmi, Sangeetha had an inspiring accompanist. At Akkarai&#8217;s hands, the lyrical beauty of Arabhi and Kiravani was brought to the fore. She brought out core of the ragas with great firmness and intensity.Manoj Siva (mridangam) and B.S. Purushothaman (kanjira) in the percussion wing impressed with the feeling that they were in full control over the supportive process.
