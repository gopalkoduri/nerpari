VThe alaap and the aakar taken by Kalaapini seemed to declare itself in silence when she took dha in kharaj.The dropping and strengthening of voice at places and the rendition of re and the touching of shadaj was negotiated with such emotion that the rasika experienced a rare and immediate completeness.The structuring of the musical phrases, the nuanced gamakas, meandering tans, the clear vibrant aakars and alaps, the significant modulations in the bandish &#8212; vahin jaavo jaavo tum jaavo balma &#8212; the characteristic swara alap through bandish; the journey between octaves in maend and finally the beautifully taken tihai was an insignia of the Kumar Gandharva style with strong traces of the Gwalior school of Pt. Vishnu Digambar Paluskar.This was followed by the Tarana, a unique composition of Kumar Gandharva himself &#8212; dena dena dena, tandeem tadeem tannom &#8212; expressing intricate vocal artistry and in extension, a deeper quest of the soul.This was followed by the release of a compact disc of the sagun and nirgun bhajans of Kalaapini Komkali, articulations of Bhakti to the formless and to the one with form.Thereafter, raga Alaiya Bilawil was taken in adha teentaal and madhya laya &#8212; Kaun batariya gayilo maahi. This most accented and swinging bandish once again set the tone and tenor of the Gandharva style.The last two bhajans &#8212; &#8220;Mrig nayni ni mero marpi&#8221; &#8212; in Manjh Khamaj and Rasia Ravre were the highlights of the morning. These resonances from the folk lore of the Malwa region filled the whole being with harmony.Vyasamurthy Kutty on the harmonium and Ravindra Yavagal on the tabla synchronised beautifully and enhanced the aesthetic pleasure of the concert.
