VA special concert to commemorate &#8216;Maharajapuram Santhanam Day&#8217; organised in association with  the Maharajapuram Santhanam Foundation, Chennai, and Nadhadweepam Trust, Tiruchi, at Srirangam, recently proved to be a rich tribute to the renowned vocalist.The vocal concert by Maharajapuram Srinivasan was thoroughly enjoyed by the audience and  he  had to acknowledge the encouraging listeners  who listened to him for over three hours in rapt attention.Said Srinivasan, &#8220;To perform my concert before an audience composed of people - not just music-loving but music-knowing - is a unique pleasure I enjoyed all throughout my concert at Srirangam.&#8221;With vocal support by S. Ganesh Viswanathan, Srinivasan was accompanied by Parur M.A. Sundaresan on the violin and Thanjavur Kumar on the mridangam.The concert which commenced with a &#8216;varnam&#8217; composed by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar was in Kaanada ragam. The thirteen other songs and kirtanas kept the audience spell-bound.Popular kritis composed by M.D. Ramanathan (&#8216;Gajavadana&#8217; in Hamsadhwani) and Purandarasar (&#8216;Govinda Ninna&#8217; in Janasamodini) were dotted with an intelligent performance in Ragamalika.  Tyagaraja kritis,  &#8216;Chelimini&#8217; in Yadukula Khambodi and &#8216;Chakkani Raja&#8217; in Kharaharapriya, as well as Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s composition &#8216;Swaminatha Paripalaya&#8217; in Nattai enthralled the audience.The concert assumed  greater significance when  Srinivasan meticulously handled &#8216;Suddha Dhanyasi&#8217; for a kirtana &#8216;Narayana&#8217; of Purandarasar.Awe-struck were the listeners when he exhibited his unique style in rendering Annamacharya&#8217;s  &#8216;Gummani Yedi&#8217; in Purvikalyani.Like his father, he ensured variety in his concert. The conclusion of the concert with the kirtana &#8216;Bho Sambho&#8217; composed by Swami Dayananda Saraswathi in Revati especially invoked memories of Maharajapuram Santhanam.
