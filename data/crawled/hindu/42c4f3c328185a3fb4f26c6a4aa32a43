V&#8220;Diversity of language, caste and creed creates confusion but the diversity of music brings people together, and &#8216;Baaja Gaaja&#8217; is a unique concept that has brought together all that is related to music with all its diversity under one umbrella,&#8221; said Gulzar after inaugurating the Baaja Gaaja Festival, held at the Ishanya Mall, Pune. This summed up the initiative of Shubha Mudgal and Aneesh Pradhan, who conceived this one-of-its-kind festival bringing all kinds of music with Indie labels, artistes, publishers, and craftsmen of musical instruments together.The three-day festival had seminars, panel discussions, films screenings, archival photo exhibition, live music and dialogues with performers and a variety of evening concerts. The whole area was thriving with exhibition and sale of CDs, DVDs, books and merchandise pertaining to music. Musical instruments makers could be seen with their exquisite craftsmanship along with the instruments they made. The festival took a resounding start with a celebratory drum ensemble comprising folk to classical, traditional to western drums that opened with one beat and gradually progressed to eight-beatcycle before playing a vibrant variety of breathtaking rhythmic variations. The shehnai players playing raga Jaunpuri took over from them to herald the  audience inside the venue. The symbolic inauguration with the guests tying bells had the Suprabhat band (the oldest band of Pune) playing &#8220;Jyoti kalash chhalke&#8230;&#8221; as the background score.The inaugural session was  followed by a seminar titled &#8216;Towards a Sound Future&#8217; that focused on insurance and financial strategies for musicians, crafts people and other agencies involved in music. There was a panel discussion on Music &amp; Media. The other seminars were on intellectual property rights and on experimentation in contemporary music besides a discussion on issues related to current performance and recording situations. The archival photo exhibition in the Tilting Art Gallery had  old photographs from the Azmat Hussain Khan collection, Jazz the Bombay collection and the SIRC collection.  The evening concerts also had an amazing variety. The first evening had a unique concert titled &#8216;1871 in 2009&#8217;. It was a recreation of repertoire from the published catalogue of Parsi Gayan Uttejak Mandali&#8217;s concert presented on 28th April 1871. This concert was a tribute to the music clubs and music circles for their contribution in popularising music. The concert that transported you to 1871 opened with an impressive Dhrupad in raga Yaman rendered soulfully by Uday Bhawalkar followed by a khayal by Anuradha Kuber. Hori was rendered first in thumri style by Shaunak Abhisheki and then in hori-dhamar style by Uday. Dadra was rendered charmingly by Bireshwar Gautam. Prachi Dhobale came up with a ghazal by Bahadur Shah Zafar. Manjusha Kulkarni Patil sang a lovely bandish and an intricate tappa. The vocalists had superb sangat on harmonium by Sudhir Nayak and Suyog Kundalkar, tabla by Bharat Kamath and pakhawaj by Manik Munde.The next two evenings had Spin-n-Scratch concert and Maestro&#8217;s Muse with Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma and Dr. Balamurali Krishna respectively.
