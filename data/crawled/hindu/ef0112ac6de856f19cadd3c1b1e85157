VA Carnatic concert by  Sreevalsan J. Menon was conducted in Thrissur as a tribute to the legendary K.V. Narayanaswamy. The performance was in every way a worthy homage to the maestro.Sreevalsan  began his concert with &#8216;Viriboni,&#8217; the Ada tala varnam in Bhairavi. From the word go, the singer was at ease. &#8216;Ninne Bhajana,&#8217; a Tyagaraja composition in Nata (Adi tala), describes the single-minded devotion of the saint composer who refuses to worship any other deity. Sreevalsan&#8217;s unusual sancharas, centred around the gandhara, gave a different feel to the familiar raga.A brisk alapana introduced Todi,  followed by the composition &#8216;Rajavedale&#8217; in praise of Sri Ranga Raja. Set to Roopaka tala, the kriti evokes the picture of the lord bedecked with precious ornaments being carried in a procession by the banks of the Kaveri.  Niraval at &#8216;Bremanu&#8217; was embellished by a variety of manodharma swaras.Sreevalsan chose &#8216;Sumasayaka,&#8217; the Swati padam in Kapi  as his next item. This was one of the masterpieces of the late Narayanaswamy. The lasya bhava of this graceful song was elucidated by the singer. The composition was interspersed with swaras and Sreevalsan made a foray into ragas Kalyani, Behag, Hindolam and Mohanam. Surprisingly, the popular &#8216;Karanam Kettu Vadi&#8217; in Poorvikalyani, composed by Geethapriyan and set to Adi tala, was sung at this stage of the concert. It is usually sung in the latter segment among the lighter compositions. Sreevalsan treated it as a regular kriti with manodharma swaras.The main raga of the concert was Kamboji. The alapana was  comprehensive, exploring all the nuances of the raga. Sreevalsan makes generous use of gamakas in his alapana style. The composition &#8216;Rasavilasamu,&#8217; set to Adi tala, was another favourite of K.V.N. Myriad  swara patterns were woven at the niraval at &#8216;Gopika Mandala.&#8217; Sreevalsan showed his understanding of the raga and his total mastery over the technique.M.A. Sundaresan, nephew of the illustrious M.S. Gopalakrishnan, provided the violin accompaniment. His playing style displayed flashes of the genius that has made his uncle a legend in his own lifetime. Thaniavartanam was sprightly, but whereas the ghatom (Kottayam Unnikrishnan) had fine touches, the mridangam (Thrissur C. Narendran) dominated.&#8216;Varugalamo Undan Arikil&#8217; is a touching plea by Nandanar to the lord of Chidambaram. A selection from &#8216;Nandanarcharitam&#8217; by Tyagaraja in raga Nathanamapriya and set to Chapu tala, the song is an ardent plea, &#8216;Can I be admitted into your presence, O Lord?&#8217; The rendition was full of fervour.Sreevalsan&#8217;s next piece was &#8216;Krishna Nee Begane Baro.&#8217;  &#8216;Samaina Matala,&#8217; a Javali in Behag, set to Roopaka tala, sounded attractive with its string of swaras. Tillana in raga Poorvi sparkled.Sreevalsan displays extensive knowledge and an in-depth understanding of the ragas. With this, he combines a passion for beauty and an eye for detail. Here is a singer whose aesthetic sensibility has not lessened his adherence to traditional precepts.The concert was organised by Rasikapriya, Thrissur, which conducts bi-monthly concerts, some of which are commemorative programmes to honour the masters.
