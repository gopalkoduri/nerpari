VThe 41st anniversary celebrations of Ragapriya Chamber of Music, Madurai, began with Nithyashree Mahadevan's concert. The Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Manasa Yetulo' in Malayamarutham was followed by the well-known kriti by Mysore Vasudevachar, &#8216;Devadi Deva' in Sunadhavinodhini. The alapana for this song was sung in different speeds and had good orchestral support from R. Hemalatha (violin).The Koteeswara Iyer kriti, &#8216;Va Saravana Bhava' in Bilahari, with its internal rhymes had percussionists I. Sivakumar on the mridangam and Alattur Rajaganesh on the ghatam, perking up. Her main alapana was in Kharaharapriya, although she mentioned that the song that followed &#8216;Rama Neeyada' was considered by purists to be in Dileepakam. The tukkadas included Ghanam Shankara Iyer's &#8216;Jagajjanani' in Ratipatipriya, Sivan's &#8216;Kanne En Kanmaniye' in Kurinji and Kanakadasa's &#8216;Rama Rama Ena Radha' in Sindubhairavi.Connoisseur's delightThe first few songs of Neyveli Santhanagopalan's concert, Tyagaraja's &#8216;Orajoopu' in Kannadagowla, and &#8216;Gnanamu Sagaradha' in Purvikalyani were an intellectual exercise wherein intriguing permutations and combinations of swaras were matched to the beats and sometimes baffled the listeners. Chennai Tyagarajan on the mridangam rose up to the occasion, with thundering climactic beats, particularly when the singer was shy of reaching the higher notes. It was when he sang the kalpanaswaras that V.V. Ravi on the violin supported him the most in his complex presentation. S. Venkatraman supported him on the ganjira. The artist focused on the melodic content of the songs when he sang Gopalakrishna Bharati's &#8216;Arukkuthan' in Purvikalyani and launched into a pleasing alapana in Mohanam for Thiruvarur Ramaswamy's &#8216;Jagadeeswari.' He further won over the rasikas by singing the pallavi &#8216;Raga Priya' in Dwijavanti for his excellent RTP in the same raga and by catering to a request from the audience and tuning a Thiruppugazh in Rasikapriya on the spot. His concert was a connoisseur's delight.Wholesome experienceUnabated energy and creativity marked the concert of the Malladi Brothers, Ramkumar and Ravi Prakash, be it the strident Maharajapuram compositon in Atana, &#8216;Sri Mahaganapatim Bajeham' or Tyagaraja's &#8216;Sogasuga' in Sriranjani or &#8216;Samayamu Telisi' in Asaveri.The brothers chose Subhapanthuvarali as the main raga for elaboration for &#8216;Pasupathi.' They complemented each other's sangathis in Kedaragowla by making slight alterations to each other's niravals for Tyagaraja's lyrics beginning &#8216;Tulasi Bi0lwa.' S. Varadarajan caught every nuance on his violin and this harmonious reciprocation made the creative sessions a wholesome experience.In the same vein, K.V. Prasad on the mridangam played the beats with subtle alteration and Tiruchi Murali on the ghatam joined him enthusiastically. Eyebrows were raised in appreciation of the tani avartanam. The final songs included singer Ramkumar's song, &#8216;Chandamama' which was set to tune by his guru Sripada Pinakapani, whose 98 {+t} {+h} birthday fell on the same day as the concert.Homage to GNBSudha Ragunathan educated the audience on the concept of sruti bedham as the process of shifting the focus from one note to another in the ragam thereby shifting to a completely different ragam. As requested by the organisers, she demonstrated this process in her alapana in Thodi for the song, &#8216;Karthikeya Kangeya.' She also paid homage to GNB by singing his &#8216;Nee Valayinche' along with a long alapana in Chayaranjani and by pointing out that he popularised the Tyagaraja kriti, &#8216;Mariyada Gadayya' in Bhairavam. Embar S. Kannan played suitably on the violin while Neyveli Skanda Subramanam enlivened the proceedings on the mridangam. Raman on the morsing played exceptionally well. Sudha concluded the concert with a tillana in Hamsanandhi, the only one composed by GNB.Passion for Tamil songsSanjay Subrahmanyan's increasing passion for Tamil was evident in his selection of songs. Except for the initial Tyagaraja kriti, &#8216;Kripa Juchutaku' in Chayatarangini and the Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Neerajakshi Kamakshi' in Hindolam, the rest of the songs were in his mother tongue. The audience enjoyed his delineation of the ragas' structure when he sang Purvikalyani, for Vallalar's &#8216;Appa Naan' and Husseini for Arunachala Kavirayar's &#8216;Enna Punniyam.' They also perceived the scope of the rarely sung &#8216;Soolini' when he elaborated on it for the main song, &#8216;Paaramugam Adheno.'Srimushnam Raja Rao's mridangam was a unique blend of fine tenor, brilliant combination of phrases, speed and dexterity that made his performance unparalleled.Sanjay's Khamas was an unstoppable flow of swaras with diverting side tracks, followed by tanam and pallavi &#8216;Jalame Seivadhazhagagumo' which he sang in ragamalika. His efforts were expertly supported by M.A. Sundaresan on the violin. He concluded the song with Bharatiyar's &#8216;Kaani Nilam' in Sindubhairavi.
