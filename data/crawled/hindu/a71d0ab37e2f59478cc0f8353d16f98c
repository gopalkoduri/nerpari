It was followed by a Dikshitar kriti in Raga Marua, rarely heard in music concerts. Owing to time constraints, he directly moved on to the main raga alapana. A rich `Charukesi' was sung with ease and received loud applause from the audience. The main kriti that was taken up was `Aadamodi Galade Ramayya... ' the masterpiece of Madurai Mani Iyer. The sarvalaghu swara patterns were sung with lot of `sowkhyam,' even though they included some challenging permutations, usually sung by Mani Iyer. It was followed by the `thani.' Suryaprakash concluded the concert with `virutham' in Kapi and Sindhu Bhairavi and a Meera bhajan.Ananthanarayanan, disciple of the celebrated violinist Kanyakumari, provided appropriate support on the violin.
