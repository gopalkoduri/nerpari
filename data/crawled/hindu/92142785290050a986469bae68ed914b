VG. Ravikiran, a promising young vocalist from Bangalore, gave a spirited concert in Coimbatore recently in connection with Sri Purandaradasar aradhana, arranged under J. Sakharam Rao memorial endowment at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan auditorium.An engineering graduate from BITS, Pilani, Ravikiran efficiently juggles a software career and his Carnatic concert schedules. Gurus R.K. Srikantan and T.M. Krishna have given him the required foundation and polish. His alapana, niraval and swarakalpanas were quite impressive on that day.A little bit of tightening will make his presentation crisp and classy.Impressive packageRavikiran began majestically with &#8216;Vandisuvudu Adiyali Gananaathana' in Nattai. The traditional composition, sung in sampradaya bhajans, &#8216;Kodu Bega Divya Mathi, Saraswathi' was presented differently in Vasantha, after a lively depiction of the raga. The endearing song, &#8216;Pogadhirelo Ranga' followed in Sankarabharanam in which Yasodha pleads with little Krishna, not to go out. Unlike the ordinary mother who would fear that her child might come to harm, Yasodha fears that the bhagavatas, saints and the women who keep yearning for him, will take him away if they set their eyes on him.After a detailed alapana of Varali, Ravikiran presented the devout pada, &#8216;Ille Vaikunta' describing the sacredness of Sriranga. The main kriti, &#8216;Odi Baarayya Vaikuntapati Ninna Noduve Mana Dhaniya' was in Bhairavi and Ravikiran decorated it with the honour it deserves. With motherly affection, Purandaradasa pleads with the Lord of Vaikunta to come running to him because he is desperate to see Him, kiss and talk to Him (&#8216;Nodi, Mudhadi, Maathadi').The slokam, &#8216;Saayankaale Vananthe' sung in ragamalika was quite enjoyable and Ravikiran followed it with &#8216;Govardhana Giridhara' by Narayana Tirtha. The vocalist received a well-deserved standing ovation after concluding his concert with &#8216;Chinnanjiru Kiliye' and a Thiruppugazh.Coimbatore S. Usha on the violin, Coimbatore R. Jayaprakash on the mridangam, Coimbatore G. Suresh on the ghatam , Peelamedu K. Sundaram on the ganjira and Palani K.V. Arumugham on the morsing (all veterans) gave excellent support and enhanced Ravikiran's brilliant performance.
