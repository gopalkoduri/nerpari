VP. VIJAYAMBIKAA temple festival or other celebrations seems empty without a nadaswaram performance by the Nalleppilly brothers, P. Narayanaswamy (86) and P. Vaidyanathan (73).   Swathi Sangeetha Sabha, Palakkad, awarded  the duo with the title `Nadachandrika.'Budding artistesThe ceremony was followed by a vocal concert by  budding  artistes Sreenadh and Karthik Harikumar.  Sreenadh, a student of class twelve, started his concert with a brisk number of Tyagaraja's `Sobillu sapthaswara' in raga Jaganmohini, set to Roopaka tala.The beauty and grandeur of vilambakala was brought out in `Akhilandeswary rakshamam,' a composition of Muthuswamy Dikshithar in raga Dwijavanthy, set to Adi tala (second speed). He concluded his concert with a thillana of Swati Tirunal in Dhanasree.Karthik Harikumar,  started the concert with a Ganapathysthuthi `Vallabha nayakasya' of Muthuswamy Dikshithar in Raga Begada, set to Roopaka tala. `Mamavasada varade' of Swati Tirunal  followed.
