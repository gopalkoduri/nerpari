VWhat do college students do when a teacher is absent? Usually, they form small groups and start playing antakshari.One such impromptu session led to a bunch of students cutting their first disc. Dhananjay Kulkarni, Edwin Laurenze, B. Sandeep, Delwin Dishan and Kanchana Gada of the Karnataka College in Bidar have brought out their music album &#8220;Na Jane Kyun&#8230;&#8221;. All the enterprising students are awaiting their final year degree results yet!They wrote the songs, composed the music and recorded the album themselves, sharing the cost of production.&#8220;Na Jane Kyun&#8230;&#8221; contains seven Hindi songs. The highlight of the album is that all the tunes are original.The lyrics carry a lot of meaning and one finds it difficult to believe that they were written by 20-year-olds! The themes of these songs are what college-goers anywhere would be preoccupied with &#8212; success, love and longing, and life ahead. &#8220;It all began when a professor did not turn up,&#8221; recalls Dhananjay who wrote the lyrics. In the antakshari that followed, he began humming a tune and asked others to identify the song.After the whole class had tried unsuccessfully, he said it was a line from one of his poems. &#8220;They forced me to set it to music. And so was born the idea for a music album,&#8221; he says.&#8220;It has been our collective effort,&#8221; says Edwin who sang some of the songs. B. Sandeep, Kanchana and Delwin sang the other songs.Delwin also composed the music with his friend Ravi Moses. The songs were recorded in Moses&#8217;s studio in Bidar.&#8220;We did it for the fun of listening to our voices on a CD player. We will continue to bring out more such albums if the response is good,&#8221; says Edwin. The album was released at the college annual day celebrations recently.In appreciation of their efforts, college Chairman Channabasappa Halahalli presented them a cash award of Rs. 11,000. The band has released around 200 Compact Discs, each priced at Rs. 50. &#8220;We spent nearly Rs. 50,000 on the album. Sandeep bore most of the cost and we shared the rest. We are yet to recover our cost,&#8221; explains Edwin.However, the group is not one to be held back by such &#8220;accounting issues&#8221; as Edwin puts it.They are already looking forward to their next album. The CDs can be ordered by calling 99002-93141, 93437-21192.RISHIKESH BAHADUR DESAIBottom Template Starts
