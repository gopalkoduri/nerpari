VSYED MUTHAHAR SAQAFJayalakshmi Sekar from Malaysia gave an enthralling performance on veena at  a music programme held at Balakala Vidhanam auditorium, Tiruchi, recently. Organised by  Sri Rama Gana Sabha Trust, Renga Nagar, the programme began with  a varnam in raga Mandaari followed by a Dikshitar kriti in Begada. Her rendering of the Sri Raga was precise and appreciable.The  programme echoed the gayaki style of   Veena Dhanammal only proving that she was trained by Pudukottai Jayarama Iyer, who belonged to the same school. Her vidwat was well exposed in her Ragam Tanam Pallavi in the raga Saveri. Her alluring raga alapanas kept the audience spellbound. Her fingering was very fluent and resembled the vocal style.Jayalakshmi Sekar's talent was espoused in the tillana in raga Yaman Kalyani. Madhusudhan on the mridangam and Ravi Krishna on  gottuvadhyam gave able support.Jayalakshmi Sekar, student of  Pinakapani, is currently under the tutelage of Lalgudi Jayaraman.Besides veena she is also proficient in playing  flute and violin.  She is the recipient of many prestigious awards and has performed in many parts of the world.Bottom Template Starts
