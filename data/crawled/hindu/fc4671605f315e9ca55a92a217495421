VRenowned singers Pankaj Udhas and Anup Jalota have sung for the &#8216;Ennumee Swaram,' an album of Malayalam ghazals. But that is not the only attraction of this album that features eight tracks composed by up-and-coming composer Jitesh Sundaram, and penned by Rafeeq Ahmed. Jitesh, who is also an up-and-coming Ghazal singer, has rendered six of the tracks.&#8216;Ee nilavil&#8230;,' the charming number sung by Udhas, is the best composition in the album. There are, as expected, a few predictable glitches in diction, but the singer's mesmerising voice makes for compelling listening.Jalota has sung &#8216;Karthika deepangal&#8230;' rather well; the emotion in the lyrics has come out nicely in his powerful voice. Jitesh's &#8216;Rathriyil mazha&#8230;' is another melodic number in the album as are &#8216;Akannirikke&#8230;' and &#8216;Athmashaila nirakal&#8230;' Rafeeq merits mention for writing some lovely lines despite being constrained by the unfamiliar rules of ghazals.
