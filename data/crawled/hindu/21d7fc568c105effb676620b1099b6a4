VB. RAMADEVIAruna Ranganathan is one of the few musicians  committed towards popularising the Trinity's rare kritis.  She sang   kritis of Tyagaraja  for Alapana at G.K.D. Auditorium, Coimbatore. A die-hard traditionalist, Aruna, who received training under Alamelu Mani of Bombay, is currently under the tutelage of Bombay S. Ramachandran.Aruna began with the varnam in Kanada, `Ninne Koriyunnaadhi' by Thiruvottriyur Tyagayyar. Though most of the kritis she presented were by Tyagaraja, they portrayed the different ways in which the saint communicated with his favourite deity.Tyagaraja's sorrowIn `Tholi Nenu Jeyu Poojaapalamu' (Kokiladhwani) Tyagaraja accepts Sri Rama's indifference sorrowfully thinking that he has not done enough good deeds to please his Lord.In the next kriti, `Brochevarevare' (Sriranjani) he asks Rama who is there to protect him if He fails to do so.In `Kadhalevaadu Kaadhe' (Narayana Gowla) he reassures himself saying Rama is not the one who will ignore him.In `Mudhu Momu' (Suryakantham) he visualises Rama's beauty and in `Neevada Ne Gaana' (Saranga) he pleads again with Rama asking him, "Don't I belong to you?"The two kritis on other deities, `Ee Vasudha Neevanti Deivamu' (Sahana-Siva) and `O Rangasaayee' (Kamboji-Ranganathar) were dealt with elaborately with good delineations of the ragas, neraval and swaraprastaras.After the lovely alapana in Anandabhairavi she presented the rare gem by Dikshitar, `Dhandaayuthapaani, Dhanditha Dhaitya Shreni'. She sang a few Tamil songs such as `Pizhaigalellaam Poruththu Adimaiyai Aandarull... ... ... ... 'However, one could not help noticing that Aruna was not in proper form that day.She had to cajole her voice with frequent doses of hot water and took time to establish her appeal.Her daughter Samyuktha Ranganathan sang alongside.M.R. Gopinath's violin and K.R.Ganesh's mridangam added liveliness to the concert.Bottom Template Starts
