VKasturi Kamala Deepthi, doing her post graduation in computers, is regarded as a well-grounded exponent of Carnatic vocals by Sangeetha Sabhas all over and by Akashvani studios in the south, as their graded artiste for the last 5 years. Having enjoyed the rare distinction of being a disciple of the vocal maestro T.N Seshagopalan at Chennai for about two years, she not only improved her image by leaps and bounds as a concert artiste in public, but also got her grade improved from B to B-High at Akashvani recently.She regaled music lovers of Visakhapatnam, her home town, rendering concerts, especially for the earliest of all music bodies of the city, Sri Vijaya Thyagaraja Sangeetha Sabha, and the grand finale of the recently organised Sankara Jayanthi celebrations. On all the occasions, she was expertly supported by P. Jnanadev on violin and G. Venkata Rao on mridangam.Whether it was the rendering of varnams in the two tempos to start with, or keerthanas on Vinayaka like Sakthi Ganapathim (Nata), briefly elaborated versions (with brief but beautiful alapanas and swaram) of Narasimhamamava (Aarabhi), Mariveregathi (Anandabhairavi) or Santhana Manjari Sankari of Dikshithar in the raga that goes by the same name, or more elaborate krithis like Bantureethi Koluveeyavayya of Tyagaraja (Hamsanadam) and expansively expatiated versions like those of Rara Rajeevalochana Rama of Mysore Vasudevachar (Mohana), she evolved paradigmatic expressions of manodharma.
