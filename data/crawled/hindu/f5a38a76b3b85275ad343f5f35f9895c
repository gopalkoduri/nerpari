VGARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMIf you were to cut an album from Aruna's Sairam's sensational performance on Sunday at the Krishna Gana Sabha, the most obvious selection would include the Ragam Tanam Pallavi (RTP) in Hanumatodi, which received a rapturous  applause (from the 800-plus audience).Aruna showed  a remarkable balance of skill and passion in her exposition of the eighth melakarta, slicing it up into many neat sancharas and then knitting them all together into a tightly woven unit.But the theme of the pallavi, a homage to the trinity of composers, was evidence of Aruna's shrewd sense of the audience's pulse; or was it the inspiration flowing from the richly deserved new title she received the previous evening!Set to chatusrajati roopakatalam in khandanadai, `Tyagarajayanamaste Guruguhaya Syamakrishnaya,' was a masterly presentation. Few might have anticipated that the ragamalika was going to be an exciting journey through some of the best-known works of the composers.Enthusiastic responseThe response from the floor at this point was perhaps the most enthusiastic during the entire recital, even though the choice of ragas was quite predictable. A sample from Tyagaraja's pancharatna series of kritis, Dikshitar's `Srisubramanyaya namaste,' in Khambodi and Syamasastri's `Mayamma,' to name a few.But to many, the evening was especially memorable because of a number of not commonly heard compositions that were featured such as Tyagaraja's `Mariyadagadayya,' in Bhairavam (derived from ragam Suryakantam, the 17th melakarta) and his disciple Veena Kuppaiyar's `Koniyadina na pai,' in Khambodi.The idea behind the vigorous and quick alapana to Khambodi, which received a like response from M.A.Krishnaswami on the violin was not obvious initially. Perhaps it was a foretaste of the many sangatis in the kriti that followed, or simply a way to show variation in tempo among compositions which seems to be a feature of an Aruna Sairam concert. For after `Devadideva' that followed next, the presentation of Sivan's kriti in Devagandhari in almost the vilambita mode was noticeable.Purandaradasa's `Panduranga baro" (Suddhasaveri) and an abhang by Janabai among others had the audience humming along with the artiste.J.H.Thyagarajan who played the mridangam will be particularly remembered for the nice concluding beat to end Papanasam Sivan's ``Yenneramum," besides his part in the two percussion spells with T.V.Vasan on the ghatam.Bottom Template Starts
