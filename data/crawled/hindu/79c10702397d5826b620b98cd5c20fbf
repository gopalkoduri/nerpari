VT.K. GANAPATHYChitraveena  N. Ravikiran, enthralled the rasikas of Coimbatore  under the aegis of Rajalakshni Fine arts at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan recently.  With perfect amplifier adjustment, the ebb and flow of melodic strain emanating from the instrument soaked into the interpretation of songs and alapanas enabling the audience to appreciate and enjoy the aesthetics in particular.The instrumentalist began his concert with the varnam, "Saami Daya" in Kedaragowla. This was followed by "Panchamatanga" in Malahari preceded by a genial raga delineation marked by phrasings covering all the nuances of the raga. The swaras garnishing the song sparkled and emphasised his musical prowess. The Varali raga vinyasam was touching for Syama Sastri's composition, "Kamakshi." "Kali Naruluku Mahimalu" in Kuntalavarali was ear-worthy. The radiance and range of Bhairavi in both the alapana and kriti were enriched with grace and intensity for Dikshitar's "Balagopalam."The artiste showcased his artistry in the raga sancharas of Khambodi, Abhogi, Saranga, Keeravani and Behag.  The recital was heightened by violinist Sriram Parasuram whose solo versions of Malahari, Varali and Bhairavi were well-etched.  His deft fingering technique and finesse took him along the crux of the Bhairavi raga journey admirably. K.V. Prasad (mridangam) and Purushothaman (kanjira) provided the percussive support with harmony and balance.Bottom Template Starts
