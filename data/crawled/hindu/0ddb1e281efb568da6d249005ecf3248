VIndhiya - Oru Innisai PayanamLyrics - Abdul KalamMusic - Kunnakudi  VaidyanathanDhvani Audio CD - Rs. 125Simple words and elevated thoughts mark the lyrics of `India &#151;  A Musical Journey' (`Indhiya &#151;  Oru Innisai Payanam.') Written by Abdul Kalam, the multi-faceted President of the country, and tuned by R. Kunnakkudi Vaidyanathan, the songs instil positive ideas of patriotism, godliness and valour. The proceeds from the sale of the audio CD (Price: Rs.125) brought out by Dhvani Audio, is for charity organisations, the back of the cover, informs.Surprisingly, most of the songs are indicated with titles that don't correspond with the first line of the number. For example, `Indha Maaperum Naatil ... ' an Unni Krishnan rendition, is marked as `Engum Paravattum Iraiyarul.' Probably, they were first written as poems, and the music came later. Sirkazhi Sivachidambaram's voice for `Enadharumai Raanuva Veerargaal' suits the mood of the patriotic number, though the vibrato in the voice is quite noticeable.Percussion plays a noteworthy part here, while `Yaazhisaiyil Pirandha... ' (Sudha Raghunathan) has an impressive and appropriate stringed accompaniment. The list of singers also includes Nityasree, K.V. Srinivasan, Aruna Sairam, T.V.R. Sekar, Geetha Raja, S. Rajeswari and R.Lalitha & R.Priya.MRNBottom Template Starts
