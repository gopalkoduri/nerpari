VUnlike the present day trend to sing so fast that they give listeners time only to listen and not to savour the substance, Padmini&#8217;s technique was to expound ragas leisurely forming sancharas essential to portray the nature of the ragas in short spells. So, her music had all the ingredients of classical purity conveyed in a quiet way.She handled sufficiently heavy compositions &#8211; &#8216;Sri Balasubramanya&#8217; (Bilahari), &#8216;Sri Venkatasaila&#8217; (Hamir Kalyani), &#8216;Sankri Sankuru&#8217; (Saveri) and &#8216;Raghuvara Nannu&#8217; (Pantuvarali) which contributed weightage. The raga delineation of Bilahari, Saveri and Pantuvarali was marked by sharpness of sancharas in small doses stressing their facets with karvais and madhyamakala. One distinguishing aspect in the alapanas was they were not swara-derivatives, but were meant to project their swaroopa. The ragas and songs were well-expressed.R. Kailasam was the violin accompanist. His solo versions of the ragas, were in the fast mode, comparatively. But the raga pictures were to the point. Vellore Ramabhadran was the mridangist. Whether accompanying a stalwart musician or his own daughter Padmini, his playing style remained the same. Tightly framed, his  percussive patterns were gentle.  The brief, poetic tani was an object for emulation.
