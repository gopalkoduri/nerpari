VG.JAYAKUMARA Carnatic vocal concert presented by T.V. Sankaranarayanan was marked by the fervour of the singer. The veteran vocalist is a traditionalist to the core and a staunch adherent of his guru Madurai Mani Iyer's style of singing. The concert was organised as part of the 29th Theerthapada Sangeethotsavam held at Theerthapadamandapam, Thiruvanathapuram.TVS began his three-hour concert with a Thulaseevanam kriti in Mohanam. An invocation to  Ganesha, `Gajananam' was set to Adi talam. He continued it with `Nijamarmamu Mulanu' of Tyagaraja in Umabharanam, a janya of Harikambhoji.  `Gayami Thavanama,' yet another Thulaseevanam kriti in Huseini, was set to Misrachappu talam.Main attractionThe major attraction of the day was a ragam tanam pallavi. The raga chosen was Kalyani. TVS began with an elaborate exposition of the raga bringing out its subtle qualities. The exchanges  between TVS and T.H. Subramaniam on the violin were enchanting. The pallavi was Dikshitar's `Kamalamba' set to Adi talam. Suitable gamaka prayogas and brisk rendering of manodharma swaras proved to be a lively experience.The thaniavarthanam was performed on the mridangam by Vaikkom Venugopal, Elanjimmel Suseelkumar on the ghatam and Neyattinkara Krishnan on the morsing.Bottom Template Starts
