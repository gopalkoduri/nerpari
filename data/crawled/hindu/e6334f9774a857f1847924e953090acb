VIn him, one could recognise both an artiste who is unassuming and a style that is devoid of ostentations: artistry carefully nurtured and protected by musical delicacies and scholarly decencies.Take for example two compositions: &#8220;Nenarunchara&#8221; (Simhavahini) and &#8220;Evarura&#8221; (Mohana - both of Thyagaraja). Imaginatively conceived alapanas, even of moderate lengths, comprised subtle sancharas systematically developed, eliciting their respective rasas.Consequently, the mood of Bhakti that took its origin in the alapanas grew perceptibly in the lyrical sections. Further, as the artiste appealingly maintained a tempo falling between vilamba and madhyalayas, the approach vouched for a vocal style in conveying the imports of the compositions. Kalpanaswaras too followed the same pattern.Two more compositions &#8211; &#8220;Karuna Elagante&#8221; (Varali - Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Bhajare Re Manasa&#8221; (Abheri - Vasudevacharya) also conformed to the expected standards, of course, carrying more details. Throughout, his technique of tutkara was remarkable: it never interfered in the smooth flow of melody.Focus was raga thana pallavi in Natakuranji &#8211; &#8220;Nattai Kuranji Amba&#8221;. It ultimately led the listeners to enjoy and admire the melodious tani avarthana and the refined rendering of the percussionists.The senior violinist  strictly followed the musical etiquettes of complementing the lead artiste&#8217;s style and imagination.Feather - touch percussions of T.A.S. Mani reminded of the legendary mridangist Narayanaswamy Appa who, it is recorded, would not even touch any hard surface, lest the subtle resonance would be marred.Nagaraja Rao Hawaldar sang under the auspices of Swarasankula Sangeetha Sabha, accompanied by Veerabhadraiah Hiremath (harmonium) and Ravikiran Nakod (tabla).The senior artiste started his recital with Raskhan&#8217;s Bandhish, &#8220;Gave Guni Ganika Gandhrab&#8221;, in Puryakalyan, giving the auchar (introduction) its due prominence in the mandra later on extending it into the madhya and taara saptakas. Remarkable deep voice reverberated sonorously in the lower pitches reached higher octaves too, with considerable ease. Vilambit phase comprised bol taans, akaarthaans and a few strains of sargams. He proportionately blended these embellishments, and the mukhda would come to precise and majestic harmonic closes, further beautified by tihais at the right and relevant moments.Badhat was desirably confined more to the slow and medium tempos. Even the druth section, &#8220;Aye Sab Brij Gopa&#8221;, had its sentimental imprints drawn from the slower ones. Consequently, his presentations turned out to be pleasing. Themes in Jayajayavanthi and Abhogi also elicited similar responses, though the later seemed to be arid. It needed more artistry and imagination for a better appreciation.Melody and rhythm accompanists did admirable work to inspire the singer on the one hand and entertain the audience on the other.Though the concert was impressive, it could have been soothing with gentle vocal inflections and a meditative involvement , as it was evident in &#8220;Sathyavantara Sangaviralu&#8221; (Kanakadasa) and &#8220;Kayo Karunanidhe&#8221;.
