Annaji Rao on violin, Akashvani, Visakhapatnam staffer Kesanapalli Gnananandam on mridangam and Saraswathula Hanumantha Rao from Eluru on ghatam kept excellent company.Sarma tunefully and with his sonorous voice started his recital by paying obeisance to Ganapathi, rendering Vighna nivarana (Nata). He followed it with Thera teeyaga raada of Thyagaraja (Mayamalavagowla janya-vakrasampoorna, apoorvaragam-Gouli Panthu).Expansively expatiating Appa Rama Bhakthi next (Suvaadi-Sampoorna raaganga ragam and Kamavardhini/ Kasiraamakriya), popularly called Pantuvarali, Sarma eruditely and empathetically projected an elated panorama not only of the raga bhava but also of the sahitya and layabhavams in the neravu and swarakalpana parts.Annajee Rao, while accompanying and playing his turns, proved his innovative mettle and Gnananandam besides following well on mridangam, also executed a well developed thani. Sarma continued on similar lines singing Sarasa Samadana (Kapee Narayani), Hanumantha (Yaman), Ramadasa's composition Poyyetappudu vembadi raadu (Subha Pantuvarli) before concluding with a composition of Purandhara Dasa (Kapi).
