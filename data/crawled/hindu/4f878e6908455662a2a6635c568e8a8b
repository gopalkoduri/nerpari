VTillanas(Composed by Lalgudi G. Jayaraman)\u000aCharsur Digital Work Station\u000aLalgudi G.J.R. Krishnan and\u000aLalgudi Vijayalakshmi\u000aCarnatic - Instrumental\u000aPrice Rs.195The composing of thillanas, since the earliest known composer of this musical form Melattur Veerabadriah, has undergone many changes and the last century has seen many vidwans who have made their contributions as composers of thillanas. It would be no exaggeration to state that the art of composing thillanas has reached its zenith with the creations of Lalgudi Jayaraman.Jayaraman's thillanas have gained immense popularity among music lovers, vocal and instrumental performers and have been acclaimed by the traditionalists as well.Lalgudi G.J.R. Krishnan and his sister Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi have presented eight thillanas of their illustrious father in this audio compact disc brought out by Charsur Digital Work Station.The Desh raga thillana is the composer's one of the most popular compositions, probably next to the evergreen Mohanakalyani thillana. The siblings have chosen an appropriate kalapramanam for this opening number and is an apt curtain raiser for the fare which follows.Clear lyrical contentGreat care has been given to the bowing by the violinists while rendering the sahitya portions and the differentiation between the jati syllables and the sahitya are clearly distinguishable. The sahityas do not become an extension of the jatis. The lyrical contents are distinctly clear in the charanam sections.Karnaranjani raga, sporting a tricky Arohanam &#8216;SRGMGPDS' has a sampoorna Avarohanam &#8216;SNDPMGRS' (derivative of Kharaharapriya), has been handled with the genius of the composer in the thillana in this raga. It is very sensitively played and does not portray the raga as a mere scale. The melody comes out in full glory and is very engaging.The next number is the adi (tisra nadai) tala set Behag raga thillana which was frequently rendered by M.L. Vasanthakumari in her concerts.Following this are thillanas in Bageshri, Vasanti, Bimplas, Dwijavanti and Madhuvanti. These ragas are very well suited for compositions which serve as tukkadas in a concert. The Vasanti raga thillana is the lengthiest one in this disc and has an eerie opening which suits the melody and warrants a second listening.Perfection has been Lalgudi's hallmark and his offspring live up to this reputation in this disc.The percussionists J. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and S. Karthick (ghatam) are seasoned artists and follow the compositions like a shadow. Their playing greatly enhances the listening pleasure.
