VIt was a trip in nostalgia. `Shubham' took the audience down the memory lane for the second time this year with its latest chapter of "Abhula Smruti ru khie". A few months ago, `Shubham' had come up with this unique concept where singers of yesteryear rendered their all-time hits after being felicitated for their lifetime contribution.This time, there were five singers who held the stage &#151;  Pandit Raghunath Panigrahi, Pranab Kishore Pattnaik, Bhubaneswari Mishra, Shekhar Ghose and Subas Das.Pandit Panigrahi opened with his hit modern song "Nali nali aei krushnachuda sate dakai mote dakai." Despite age catching up with him, he enraptured the audience with his typical style. But it was perhaps too exhausting for him and three other hit numbers of his were rendered by his son Parthasarathi Panigrahi.The next singer Pranab Kishore Patnaik who had formed the redoubtable triumvirate with Akshay Mohanty and Sikandar Alam five decades ago was in fine form. "Simahina Dariya sathihina duniya," "Ja re majhi ja," "Ratire amaghara loka sabu soi gala pare" and "Aei Jibana ta eka nataka" were rendered with feeling and took the audience back to the times when Pranab with his sonorous, emotion-packed voice enthralled millions.Bhubaneswari Mishra, after an impromptu tribute to the programme, began with a `bhajan' "Jagata ra natha."She went on to belt out modern songs "Manamayuri mo bayasa dena re," "Emiti rati ae je abhula smruti," "Shanibara dina mo bhaujanka mana", etc.Bhubaneswari had given a number of film hits and these numbers brought those golden days alive. Shenkhar Ghose, though no longer active for many years now, wove his magic with his all-time hit "Hrudaya ra aei sunyata ku." Some other numbers like "Nuabou mora nuabou," "Surya go tuma udaya ranga" and the `bhajan' "Jaga re to kaivalya paeen mana jhurila" were lapped up by the listeners.Subas Das is very much active in the music scene today. Yet, some of his old hits like "Udija mo suna chadhei," "Tora udi udi jae kani," etc., drew tremendous applause.B.M.Bottom Template Starts
