VMuddumohan, the director of the Department of Kannada and Culture, is an unassuming Hindusthani musician. He gave an impressive recital at the  67th Sri Ramanavami Music Festival organised by the Sri Rama Seva Mandali, Chamarajpet at the Fort Highschool.  Trained by Pandit Basavaraj Rajaguru and Dr. Gangubai Hangal, Muddumohan gave a good rendition of Pooriya Kalyan. The sancharas were ornate. Though he did have some voice problems, he compensated for it with his emotion-laden singing. Appropriately accompanied by Ravindra Katoti (harmonium) and Vishwanatha Nakod (tabla), the singer regaled the audience by presenting a string of Dasarapadas. Alongside, he rendered the various Kaanadas like Abhogi Kaanada, Shahana Kaanada, Darbari Kaanada... With a fine discernment of voice modulation he sang a moving Adana in "Rama bhajo".M.
