VThe pure stream of expression drew the attention of rasikas. A staff on the Bangalore Akashwani, Geetha adhered to the tenets of tradition and classicism of veena-playing. Thus one had the pleasure of listening to some chaste music. &#8220;Vatapi Ganapathim&#8221;, &#8220;Deva Deva&#8221; (Mayamalavagowla, Swati Tirunal), &#8220;Sadhinchane&#8221; (Arabhi) and &#8220;Sudhamayi&#8221; (Amritha varshini) which formed the earlier part of the concert were rendered in such a manner as to create a cohesive musical atmosphere.Rightly placed accents marked a beautiful &#8220;Kharaharapriya&#8221;. The unruffled delineation followed by tana malika in five ghana ragas was a treat. Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Chakkani Raja Margamu&#8221; further glowed with Geetha&#8217;s swara ornamentation. She concluded her concert with the Behag tillana. M. Gururaj (mridanga) and Narasimhaprasad (ghata) rose to the occasion with compatible pakka vadyas.***Veteran singer-poet-composer Parvathisutha regaled the packed and enthusiastic student-audience at the Vijaya Degree College with his singing and talk on World Literacy Day.He spoke about the greatness and importance of the Kannada language.In his lecture, punctuated and enriched by his singing, he quoted the contributions of Shishunala Sharif, Bhatkhande, DVG, Kuvempu, Anakru and others to the field of sugama sangeetha.Playing on the harmonium, he sang a good number of his own compositions to drive home his observation.  He also demonstrated various forms of sugama sangeetha on the basis of classical, light classical, folk, devotional and spiritual compositions.He enthralled the audience by singing, with explanation, the beauty of punning on words. For this he rendered a Kanakadasa pada &#8220;Kaayi nee kaayi&#8221; comprising the names of several vegetables but skilfully emanating philosophical meaning. Parvathisutha endeared himself with his singing of compositions by Purandaradasa, Meera Bai, DVG, Rajarathnam, GSS and others.
