VClarity of diction and perfect sruti alignment characterised the vocal recital of Poornima Krishnan, featured under the auspices of Nada Brahma Gana Sabha in Vanaprastha, Vadavalli.Poornima's appealing voice, from the opening Kalyani varnam with chittaswaras, set the tone for a lively music session.Clear definition of ragas&#8216;Maha Ganapathi' in Kanada and &#8216;Naada Sudharasa' in Aarabhi displayed her skill and supreme self-confidence. Her alapanas of Purvikalyani for the kriti, &#8216;Intha Paramukham' and Hindolam for &#8216;Govardhanagireesam' were fluent, clearly defining the select contours of the ragas flavoured with tonal felicity.Though Poornima's clever use of gana naya techniques was evident in the raga delineations of Suddhasaveri for the kriti, &#8216;Janani Paahi' and Shanmukhapriya for RTP her inability in using akaaras and ukaaras failed to bring out their nuances effectively.The other items included &#8216;Orajupuju' (Kannadagowla), &#8216;Varadarajam Upasmahe' (Saranga) and &#8216;Guruvayrappane Appan.'The concert concluded with a lilting tillana in Behag. Brinda was the violin accompanist.Ragunath's rhythmic beats on the mridangam added pep to the kutcheri.
