VLalita SantanamAbhiraj productionsRs. 150.There has been a frequent mushrooming of the composers of the fairer sex over the last couple of decades, one amongst whom is Lalita Santanam (not to be confused with Lalitha Santhanam of the Sattur Sisters).Lalita has had her tutelage under Ramadass (disciple of Brinda and Muktha), K. Rangarajan and others. The composer vocalist has rendered nine  of her Tamizh compositions in this disc on deities like Ganesha, Surya, Krishna, Muruga, Hanuman and Devi. These simple lyrics, devotional in content, have been tuned and sung in melodies like Bowli, Sourashtram, Ritigowlai, Kapi, Shanmukhapriya, Kalyani, Hindolam, Desh and Nadanamakriya. The rendering by the vocalist reveals her innate passion for Carnatic music.The name of the accompanying mridangam artiste (Mannarkoil Balaji) precedes the name of the violinist (Pudukottai Ambika Prasad) in the inlay card. Ghatam accompaniment has been provided by Srirangam S. Ravishankar. A booklet accompanies the compact disc in which the notations for the songs have been provided. This will facilitate those who wish to learn these compositions.
