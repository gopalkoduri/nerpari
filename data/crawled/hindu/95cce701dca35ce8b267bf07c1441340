VIt is a confluence of who's who in western and Indian classical music arena. Yes, the legendary Paul Simon's recent album &#8216;So Beautiful Or So What' (2008) is a collaboration with percussion maestro Karaikkudi Mani for the lovely song &#8216;Dazzling Blue.'The lyric runs like P.B. Shelley tucked with T.S. Eliot! The lines, &#8220;but the CAT scan's eye sees what the heart's concealing; nowadays when everything is known&#8230;.. you and I were born beneath a star of dazzling blue..,&#8221; are simple yet charming.Romanticism meets pragmatism and erupts into a fountain of poesy. The music translates this dichotomy into rhythm and song so beautiful.Soulful lyricThe percussion just fits the bill. The lyric sung so soulfully by Paul Simon is like a lullaby under the canopy of a moonlit night. It's not hard rock, there is a soothing touch and the blend of Mani's excellent mridangam beat with the rest of the orchestra is perfect. The very Indian &#8216;konnakkol' (syllabic utterance) gives the song an extra dimension such as &#8220;CAT scan&#8221;! Can blue dazzle? you could well question. No it is not the sea metaphor as most of us are bound to pre-suppose going by the title of the song. It is the twinkling star that dazzles like a diamond in the sky looking down at a pair of destined lovers. It is a matter of pride that the mridangam is able to stabilise the rhythm patterns within its parameters and produce a seamless merger of two streams of music.And this is Paul Simon's second collaboration with an Indian maestro after five decades; the first being with Pt. Ravi Shankar in the 1960s.While most of us know the percussion wizard Karaikkudi Mani, who came into limelight at a tender age of seven and is still going strong, Simon, a winner of a dozen Grammy Awards (one was a Lifetime Achievement award) and an Oscar nominee (2002) is a miracle musician-composer. This American-born singer-songwriter and guiterist sparkled like a dazzling star in the musical firmament re-emerging whenever the skies were clear. He is one of the few musicians who has withstood time and change in the western world to turn into a legend in his lifetime.
