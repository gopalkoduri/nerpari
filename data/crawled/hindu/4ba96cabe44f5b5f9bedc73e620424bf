VA concert titled &#8220;Nada Navaneetha Sri Thyagaraja's Nada Neerajana&#8221; was presented by R.K. Srikantan, accompanied by R.S. Ramakanth (vocal support), T.T. Srinivasan (violin), A. Renuka Prasad (mridanga) and Dayananda Mohite (ghata) under the auspices of MES Kalavedi, Bangalore, recently.Compositions expounding the power of sound and the efficacy of music as a pathway to self realisation and attainment of salvation, couched in a variety of ragas and talas, were culled from the substantial legacy of the great saint composer. The import of each was explained and key epithets within the krithi highlighted, introducing listeners to the ultimate purpose of music as envisioned by Thyagaraja. An arresting beginning was made with &#8220;Shobhillu Sapthaswara&#8221; in Jaganmohini raga and rupaka tala, accentuated by a few rounds of kalpana swaras. The other pieces in the concert were &#8220;Bhajana Seyave&#8221; in Kalyani raga and rupaka tala, the adi tala krithi &#8220;Nadathanumanisham&#8221; in Chittaranjini, &#8220;Nadasudharasambilanu&#8221; in Arabhi, &#8220;Nadaloludai&#8221; in Kalyanavasantham, &#8220;Nadopasana&#8221; in Begada, &#8220;Ragaratnamalikache&#8221; in Reethigowla and &#8220;Swararagasudha&#8221; in Shankarabharanam. Some of the inclusions were prefaced with alapanas, notably those in Kalyani, Arabhi and Kalyanavasantham, and also supplemented with kalpana swaras, underscored by good understanding and support from the accompanying artistes. The elaboration of Begada reflected the classic style of the maestro, as did the magnificent rendition of the ensuing composition. A brief neraval and kalpana swaras in Shankarabharanam were followed by a succinct thani avarthana, the accent being more on faithful and bhava laden expositions of the compositions, characterised by a clarity and purity that are adornments in themselves.A vocal recital by Bombay Jayashri, accompanied by Embar Kannan (violin), Manoj Siva (mridanga) and Udupi Sridhar was part of the Ganjam Flights of Fantasy Concerts 2010.&#8220;Vathapi Ganapathim&#8221; in Hamsadhwani, bedecked with a few kalpana swaras, and &#8220;Enduku Nirdaya&#8221; in Harikamboji, were the inaugural items in a concert permeated with melody and phenomenal improvisational prowess. Amrithavarshini was taken up next for a beautiful alapana, suffixed with Deekshithar's &#8220;Anandamrithakarshini&#8221; in adi tala and attractive kalpana swaras. &#8220;Nee Dayarada&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in Vasanthabhairavi raga and rupaka tala served as prelude to an expansive alapana of Kharaharapriya. Abundant manodharma and extraordinary flights of imagination infused the sancharas with a life and individuality of their own, though one did at times miss the sedate sweetness of a simpler and more traditional articulation. &#8220;Pakkala Nilabadi&#8221; in mishra chapu thala was rendered with a neraval at &#8220;Manasuna Dalachi Maimarachi&#8221;, with kalpana swaras appended to the pallavi. Purandaradasa's &#8220;Sakala Grahabala Neene&#8221; in Athana raga and khanda chapu thala led to the focal point of the evening, a brilliant raga tana pallavi in three ragas, Ranjini, Bindumalini, and Priyadarshini, with the pallavi beginning &#8220;Lalithe Mam Pahi Sive&#8221; set to chathurasra jathi atta tala. The dramatic interplay of the ragas, creating a kaleidoscopic effect in all three components of the exercise, was augmented by outstanding support from the accompanists. The extraordinary composure, serenity and grace displayed by the vocalist throughout the performance, eschewing all harsh expressions, gestures and movements, were indeed the hallmarks of a consummate performing artiste.
