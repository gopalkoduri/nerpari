VDr. S. Sundar&#8217;s thematic concert for Hamsadhwani on Dikshitar Day was enlivened by pertinent explication that made the presentation part lec-dem as the vocalist traced Dikshitar&#8217;s musical journey through his kritis with particular emphasi\u000as on the raga mudra and kshetra mudra woven into them. The opening notes in raga Hamsadhwani heralded the iconic Muthuswami Dikshitar kriti &#8220;Vatapi Ganapathim&#8221; that set a brisk kutcheri pace.The composer&#8217;s father, Ramaswami Dikshitar, was responsible for drawing attention to this pentatonic raga, said the artist. The youngest among the musical Trinity, Dikshitar was also the most widely travelled, visiting temples all over India and singing in praise of a vast pantheon of deities. The second item presented was the second song composed by Dikshitar, &#8220;Manasa Guruguha&#8221; (Ananda Bhairavi) introduced by a compact raga sketch.A sprightly &#8220;Aadipureeswaram&#8221; (Arabhi), in praise of the Tiruvotriyur deity followed. A rather detailed exposition of raga Lalitha and &#8220;Hiranmayeem&#8221; (Shwetadweepa kshetra) were sung with emotive conviction. Manodharma spurred niraval and kalpanaswaras at the line &#8220;Sangeetha Vadhya.&#8221; Dikshitar&#8217;s fondness for the 15th mela Mayamalavagowla and its janya ragas was manifested in kritis set in ragas such as Gurjari and Lalitha.The group kritis include the Panchalinga kshetra kritis among which the artist chose &#8220;Ananda Natana Prakasam&#8221; (Kedaram, Chidambara kshetra) in which the inclusion of jatis highlights Shiva&#8217;s tandavam. &#8220;Sarasijanaabha Sodari&#8221; (Nagagandhari) came as a filler. The Panthuvarali alapana drew upon essential features and was grounded in solid classical vocabulary. Madhyamakala sancharas and vadi-samvadi permutations backed by an air of assuredness sculpted a definite form and lent punch. The kriti was &#8220;Ramanatham Bhajeham&#8221; (Rameswaram Kshetra).The pilgrimage continued with &#8220;Somasundaram Bhajeham&#8221; (Suddha Vasantham, Madhurapuri kshetra). The Hemavathi delineation derived strength from apt emphasis on prayogas structured around the rishabha, panchama and dhaivata. &#8220;Sri Kanthimathim&#8221; was embellished with appealing sarvalaghu motifs in swaraprasthara. &#8220;Maamava Pattabhirama&#8221; (Manirangu) and &#8220;Purahara Nandana&#8221; (Hameer) completed the kshetradanam.The clean, uncluttered lines of the neat patanthara carried the unmistakable stamp of the D.K. Jayaraman school to which the vocalist belongs. Sahitya enunciation was succinct and clear, yet another distinguishing trait of this bani. Bright vocal support was provided by Keerthana, disciple of Dr. Sundar. Mullaivasal Chandramouli (violin) and Vellore Ramabhadran (mridangam) brought their considerable experience and expertise to bear upon the recital.
