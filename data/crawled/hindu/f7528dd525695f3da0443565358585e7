VGUDIPOODI SRIHARIIt was a beautiful opening of a festive session, purely allotted for ghazal singing reflecting the culture of Hyderabad and also exposing abundant talent available in this field. There are not only singers but poets too in Hyderabad reputed for writing ghazals, and also for rendering them with touch of authenticity.A reflection of the twin cities' secular philosophy the festival, projected as Sampradaya Kala Vaibhavam, now in Urdu culture, was formally inaugurated at the open air lawns of Ravindra Bharati..The inaugural programme was the rendition of ghazals by Zeba. Zeba, with excellent stage presence, won the hearts with her opening numberDard se mera daaman. The rendition was sweet for she was endowed with melodious voice and literary sense, which are very important for any ghazal to sink into the mind. Similarly the ghazalRanjish hi sahiand the subsequentRafta rafta woh meribrought out the melancholy associated with the lyrics.The second singer of the evening was Adnan Salem. He has given performances in the Middle East . He opened with Saleem Kausar's ghazalMain khayal hoon kisi aur kawith some philosophic expression.Adnan too has impressive expression and has voice that has resonance and range.Tabaye dil aazmae tuandMein kya karoonpenned by the scion of Nizam rulers, Prince Mauzzam Jah,  proved a good draw with `wah wahs'.The highlight was poet Shakeel Badayuni'sKaise kahoon ki mulaqat nahi hoti hai, that expresses the mind  of a lover who is  unable to communicate with his beloved.Both the artistes got good instrumental support with traditional harmonium and tabla and an addition of  keyboard, meeting the demand of modern taste. This festival would be having a qawwalis too, besides a few more ghazal programmes.Bottom Template Starts
