VRasikas were in for a treat of authentic and  pure music this past week end at Ayodhya Aswamedha Maha Mandapam, West Mambalam. Singing for the 56th Sri Rama Navami celebrations of Sri Ram Samaj, Vijay Siva opened his concert with Patnam Subramania Iyer&#8217;s Thodi raga varnam setting the mood for the rest of the evening.Close on the heels came &#8216;Hiranmayeem&#8217; (Lalitha-Rupakam-Dikshitar). Taking up niraval in &#8216;Geeta Vadya Vinodhinim,&#8217; Vijay explored the raga  using subtle and bright phrases. The same could be said of the swaras that followed.A brisk Kalyani raga alapana that came next kept the rasikas engaged. It was a statement on the lakshana of raga alapana what with long karvais, controlled akara and vakra phrases. No wonder young music students make it to his concerts.Amritha Murali on the violin was in her element that day probably inspired by the main artist. One good thing about Amritha was her constant eye contact with the main singer which is a very important quality for an accompanist.&#8216;Mamta Bandhanayuta&#8217; (Nidhi Chalaa Sukhama, Misra Chapu, Tyagaraja) was apt for niraval and Vijay did it with aplomb. His younger brother Manoj Siva (mridangam) and H. Prasanna (ghatam) pepped up the proceedings with interesting arudis and tekkas.Performing at the Ayodhya Mandapam is always a challenge, what with the bustle of heavy traffic,  air horns and horns sounding like trombones.  Interpreting Begada, Vijay was an epitome of concentration packing it with orthodox and traditional pidis.A fast-paced &#8216;Thiagarajaya Namasthe&#8217; (Rupakam-Dikshitar) with madhyama kala swaras maintained the evening&#8217;s tempo and the trend continued in &#8216;Ramabhiarama&#8217; (Dhanyasi-Adi-Tyagaraja).Tonal clarity marked the Madhyamavathi essay of Vijay which was vintage stuff. Amritha was a perfect foil. Siva sang the rarely heard third charanam of &#8216;Palinchu Kamakshi&#8217; (Adi-Syama Sastri) keeping the devotional fervour intact.Manoj Siva and H. Prasanna continued their good work in the tani with lively exchanges.Manoj&#8217;s chapu was mesmerising. After a Thevaram and a kriti of Pillai Perumal Iyengar, Vijay concluded his concert with Gopalakrishna Bharati&#8217;s &#8216;Varugalamo&#8217; (Manji-Misram) that was emotion-filled.A word about the sound engineer, Ramesh,  who has been doing a good job since he took over the mantle from his father M.K. Kannan of Kanna Sound System. Armed with a fairly good knowledge of Carnatic music, he arranges acoustics depending on the artist, which is appreciated by all the msucians.  That was evening was no different.
