VHARISH BALThe verve and zeal with which he sings...  imparts a unique quality to his music.T.V. Sankaranarayanan is a crowd-puller. Keen students of music and staunch practitioners of pure music gather for more of his highly inspiringswaraprasthara, which is his forte. The verve and zeal with which he sings, capturing the joy and mood of every composition, imparts a unique  quality to his music. His vocal concert was organised under the auspices of Kerala Fine Arts Society and AVT.Quite surprisingly TVS started with avirutham`Kazhalina kumbitten,' and as Arabhi unfurled in myriad shades, the vocalist was exploring just one of his many specialities.It was followed by `Vighneswara subhakaraka.'A raga exposition of Mohanakalyani was rendered as smooth long phrases of continuoussancharasthrough the octave. On the violin, Nagai Sriram showed remarkable memory in meticulously reproducing the raga andswarapassages for `Seve Srikantham.' He even followed the typical TVS usage ofakaramsinswarasinging.`Ravichandrabudhaneene' in Atana provided for rhythmic variation at this stage. As compared to Mohanakalyani, the elaboration of which was more wholesome, TVS'salapanaof Madhyamavati was systematic and progressive. Thekalapramanaseemed to be just right and the audience enjoyed it to the hilt as they kept time to the music. Sankaranarayanan's delineation of Sankarabharanam flowed like a stream.  For `Etula nilachite,' the detailed thani from Melakaveri Balaji on the mridangom and Thenkasi Parameswaran on the ghatom was a exposition of rhythmic mastery that never went overboard.Towards the end of the concert, TVS went for the regular numbers of his mentor Madurai Mani Iyer, `Eppo varuvaro' in Jonpuri and the enticing western note.Bottom Template Starts
