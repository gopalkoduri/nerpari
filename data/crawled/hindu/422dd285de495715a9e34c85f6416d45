VSruti Iyer, a disciple of Sulochala Pattabhiraman and Prema Hariharan, performed for Hamsadhwani on December 2. Clarity in gamakas is one of her pluses, while she needs to develop more confidence in singing kalpanaswarams and raga alapana.Beginning with Saveri varnam in an impressive three speeds (including tisram), Sruti continued with Papanasam Sivan's ``Tatvamariya tarama" (Ritigowla), ``Ganamurte" (Ganamurti), ``Indubhagya" (Hindolam), ``Garudagamana" (Nagaswarali).``Etavunara" (Kalyani) was the main song for the evening. Sruti was accompanied by R Nagaraj (violin) and by Tiruvidaimarudur Sankaran (mridangam).TempoThe selection of songs and singing them in the right tempo matters a lot in a concert. That way, Anita Venkatramani Kothari's concert left a lot to be desired. She has to improve on these aspects and come up on her own merit.With a book in front, which had everything notated, Anita began her concert with ``Valachivachi" (Navaragamalika varnam) and then sang ``Vinayaka ninnu" (Hamsadhwani), ``Evarani" (Devamrutavarshini), ``Sivasiva" (Pantuvarali) and ``Marivere" (Anandabhairavi).  Tyagaraja's ``Kaligiyunde" (Keeravani) was the main song.``Bhogindra sayinam" (Kuntalavarali) and ``Rogaharana" (Bageshri) formed a part of the tukkuda section. Anita was accompanied by Neela Jayakumar (violin) and V. R. Jayakumar (mridangam).Bottom Template Starts
