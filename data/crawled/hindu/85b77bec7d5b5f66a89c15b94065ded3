VHamsavahini began the recital with a traditional &#8220;Sri Ganapatini&#8221; in the raga Sourashtra, followed by the Pancharatna kritis &#8212; namely, &#8220;Jagadanandakaraka&#8221; (raga Nattai), &#8220;Dudukugala&#8221; (raga Gowla), &#8220;Sadinchene&#8221; (raga Arabi), &#8220;Kanakanaruchira&#8221; (Raga Varali) and &#8220;Entharo Mahanubhavulu&#8221; (raga Sri).Before commencing each Pancharatna, each  artiste presented a very brief sketch of the raga through alapana and taanam. It was thoughtful of the group to do so. Prema Mallikarjun co-ordinated well and took along the other four veena artistes (her own students) with her, with utmost regard for sruti and laya.Each veena having seven strings (including three tala strings), tuning all the thirty-five strings perfectly during the recital itself gives a kind of listening pleasure. The group did a good job and took utmost care to see that the tuning was perfect throughout the recital. The  recital concluded  with a melodious &#8220;Gitarthamu&#8221; in the raga Suruti.On the whole, it was a neat and powerful recital that brought out the glory of the Pancharatna kritis. The other veena artistes were Geetha Mohan, Nalini Sampath, Uma Balasubramaniam and young Veena Venkatramani. Kumbakonam N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam ably assisted the group. His understanding support throughout enhanced the overall outcome of the group&#8217;s recital.In a recital that preceded the veena recital, master Anirudh Bharadwaj too captivated the hearts of the  listeners through his impressive flute recital. Whether it was the kriti presentations as such, or the manodharma aspects, Anirudh exhibited admirable maturity in handling these, within the one-hour time slot given to him.While presenting Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Durmargachara&#8221; in the raga Ranjani, Anirudh brought the emotive aspects of this raga to the fore. He also presented a fine alap of this raga, and swaraprastaras that he presented towards the end were rich in creativity. He also handled well a composition of Papanasam Sivam, &#8220;Devi neye thunai&#8221; in the raga Kiravani. Earlier, he presented a good sketch of this raga. The niraval of a phrase &#8220;Alaimagal kalaimagal&#8221; from the charanam portion of the song and the subsequent swaraprastaras too were creatively handled.Arvind Bharathi on the violin, T.S. Shriram on the mridangam and N. Harinarayanan on the ghatam ably assisted Anirudh in this recital.
