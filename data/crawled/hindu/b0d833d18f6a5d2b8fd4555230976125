VA compromise on the sruti (pitch) has to be arrived at generally when a singing duo consists of a male and a female vocalist.This might not enable them to give a free reign to their manodharma and to some extent will restrict their creativity. This is not felt in the combination of the voices of K. Krishnakumar and Binni Krishnakumar. Their voices blend well in the recently released audio compact disc titled 'Divine Ragas.'The evergreen &#8216;Vatapi Ganapatim' (Hamsadhwani, Muthuswami Dikshitar) is sung as the curtain raiser.Brisk tempoPurvikalyani is essayed by Binni which gains more clarity as the alapana progresses after a hesitant beginning.The composition sung is a creation of M. Balamuralikrishna (&#8216;Nee Dayarada'). Swati Tirunal's Kuntalavarali kriti &#8216;Bogindrasayinam' (K. Chapu) is vocalised in a brisk tempo. The slow paced sancharas are meaningful and register well. The violinist offers a tidy raga reply as well.Tyagaraja's &#8216;Intha Sowkya' is sung with a good focus on the diction of the lyrics.Percussionists Mannarkovil J. Balaji (mridangam) and Vaikkom R. Gopalakrishnan (ghatam) have accompanied with a lot of enthusiasm and offer a short precise thani avartanam at the conclusion of the Kapi kriti.The tukkada segment comprises &#8216;Ninaikada Neramillai' (Ragesri-M.M.Dandapani Desigar), &#8216;Narayana Namo' (Sarasangi in Madhyama Sruti - Narayana Tirtha), &#8216;Yake Nirdaya' (Ragamalika-Purandaradasa) and &#8216;Rama Deiva Sikhamani' (Sindhubhairavi-Bhadrachalam Ramadas).Binni and Krishnakumar have pleasing and pliable voices and would do well to ensure that the kalapramana of the brigas during raga and niraval singing is complimentary to the slow-paced sancharas.
