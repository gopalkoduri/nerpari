VNow the duo has completed the second album (Audio Books 2 and 3) containing the kritis from the raga Punnagavarali (janya of Raganga no 10 - Thodi) up to Raganga Raga 14 - vativasanthabhairavi.The two audio Books contain 11 compositions. This also includes two versions of the kritis &#8220;Ehi Annapurne&#8221; and &#8220;Chandram Baja Manasa&#8221; wherein the first is exactly as per the notation in &#8220;Sangita Sampradaya Pradarshini&#8221; and the second is a contemporary interpretation of the notation given by Subbarama Dikshitar. This helps the listener understand the transformation that the raga has undergone over a period of time.The CDs have Krishna singing the kritis and R.S. Jayalakshmi playing them on the veena. They are accompanied by Shriramkumar on the violin and K. Arun Prakash on the mrudangam. Dr. N. Ramanathan and R.S. Jayalakshmi are the project advisors.
