VAyoung man from Semmangudi\u000ain Tamil Nadu,\u000aall of 14, had shown a\u000aradiant presence on the\u000aGayana Samaja platform in\u000aBangalore, nearly eight decades\u000aago. Gayana Samaja was\u000aalso in its teens then, overflowing\u000awith energy and zeal\u000ato bring in the best of musicians\u000afrom all over the\u000acountry for Bangaloreans to\u000arevel in. The childhood musician\u000awas none other than\u000aSrinivasa Iyer who had already\u000ashown sparks of his\u000abudding mastery. So proficient\u000awas the young master\u000athat the vocalist gradually\u000acame to be referred to as\u000a`Semmangudi' itself. Just as\u000aSrinivasa Iyer was regarded\u000aas an institution by himself, it\u000ais for the propagation of such\u000aserious `gayana' that Gayana\u000aSamaja had been established,\u000aand the persistent efforts to\u000asieve the best of talents year\u000aafter year was what helped\u000athe institution celebrate its\u000acentenary in 2005.It is only too thoughtful of\u000athe 103-year-old sabha to\u000acommemorate the grand old\u000alegend of Carnatic Music,\u000aSemmangudi Srinivasa Iyer,\u000awho etched the path to the\u000agrand Semmangudi school,\u000aan approach and style that is\u000atime-honoured. As this year\u000ahappens to be Semmangudi's\u000abirth centenary, Gayana Samaja's\u000ahomage will bring a\u000amelody special dedicated to\u000athe maestro. Scheduled from\u000aJuly 20 to 26, it will be followed\u000awith the Samaja's Annual\u000aConference and Music\u000aFestival (with morning and\u000aevening sessions) from July\u000a27 to August 3.\u000aSays H. Kamalanath, President,\u000aGayana Samaja: "In our\u000ahomage to the master from\u000aSemmangudi, we will have\u000amusic and dance presentations\u000awhere in compositions\u000aof Swati Tirunal composed by\u000aSrinivasa Iyer will be taken\u000aup. There will be a photographic,\u000avideo and multimedia\u000apresentation on the life\u000aand achievements of Iyer,\u000asome audio clips of his live\u000aconcerts, and lecture demonstrations\u000afrom eminent musicians\u000aclosely associated\u000awith the master and his\u000aschool on various aspects of\u000ahis life and passion."No words neededReminiscing the maestro\u000awho was known for his quick\u000arepartee, Kamalanath says:\u000a"When we requested him to\u000aformally inaugurate the fullyfurnished\u000aauditorium of\u000aGayana Samaja on K.R. Road\u000ain 1994, he had instantly said:\u000a`Let it be a musical dedication\u000ato Goddess Sharada,' don't\u000ahave speeches and ribboncuttings,'\u000aand the musician\u000awent on to take to the stage\u000adirectly with music without a\u000aword or lecture. He was\u000astraightforward, but practical\u000aand down to earth. As he was\u000aassociated with the Royal\u000afamily of Travancore and had\u000apopularised the Swati Tirunal\u000akritis, we thought some of\u000athem could be highlighted\u000atoo. We had conferred the\u000a`Gayana Sarvabhouma' on the\u000amaster, a rare honour from\u000athe Samaja bestowed on two\u000amusicians only till now."Gayana Samaja is into its\u000a104th year of service, perhaps\u000athe oldest institution in India\u000ato have uninterrupted yearly\u000aprogrammes from 1905. How\u000adid the effort mature into a\u000acolossal establishment in\u000aKarnataka where the all-time\u000amaestros from all over the\u000acountry have illuminated its\u000adais? Recalls Kamalanath: "It\u000aall began in 1905 with a group\u000aof ardent music lovers going\u000afrom house to house collecting\u000afunds and these 100-odd\u000ayears have seen the Samaja's\u000amusical history grow from\u000aEkambara Sahuji Hall in\u000aChikpet and Hall of London\u000aMission High School whose\u000aheadmaster K. Ramachandra\u000aRao played an important role\u000afor the Samaja's formation.\u000aLater, the old Sanskrit\u000aCollege in Chamarajpet and the\u000aShankaraiah Hall constructed\u000aby Chief Justice K.S. Chandrashekhara\u000aIyer was of\u000aimmense help, before the Samaja\u000acould afford a building\u000aof its own in 1962. It was M.S.\u000aSubbulakshmi's personal\u000acontribution and funds collected\u000aout of her benefit concerts\u000athat increased the\u000areserves enormously to see\u000athe building take shape."Long journeyThe modest-yet modern\u000ahall with good acoustics on\u000aK.R. Road today has close to\u000a2,000 members. From the oldest\u000aPoochi Srinivasa Iyengar,\u000aMysore Vasudevacharya,\u000aMuthiah Bhagavathar, Veena\u000aSeshanna to Omkarnath Thakur\u000aand Bade Ghulam Ali\u000aKhan. the accomplishment\u000ahas seen a delicious spread.\u000aKnown for its `no-language\u000aand regional restrictions' the\u000aSamaja has Carnatic, Hindustani,\u000adance, gamaka, musical\u000afeatures and drama, just as its\u000aspread of youth festivals,\u000acompetitions and conferences\u000ago on. A book on the history\u000aof the Samaja and a\u000areference guide of Carnatic\u000acompositions is on the cards.(Call 26506049 for programme\u000adetails)
