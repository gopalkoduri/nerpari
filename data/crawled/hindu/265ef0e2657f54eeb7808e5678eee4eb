VAs a part of its weekly concerts, Nada Bharathi featured a vocal recital by Swetha Prasad. Swetha has learnt from Neti Sreerama Sharma, Seshulatha, and Komanduri Seshadri. She has earned a name in the field of dance by accompanying on the vocals for \u000aleading dancers in the south, and has also travelled across the world.Swetha showed a lot of promise in her concert with her potential and tight performance. Her voice has the right modulation technique, and she managed the concert well with her past experience in the dance field.Swetha began with the famous Natakuranji varnamChelamela, and then hummed a brief Hamsadwani for  with crisp swaram. Thyagaraja&#8217;sGanamurtyin the raga Ganamurti was sung melodiously, followed byNada Sudha Rasain Arabhi. Swetha then took a slokam in Valachi for a rare Ramadasu krithi,Narayanam Bhaje Narayanam. Papanasan Sivan&#8217;sKavavain Varali was a solo display. Here she should have sung the ragam to embellish the concert.The main attraction of the concert was the detailed expansion of Shanmukapriya ragam. Swetha came out with a neat rendition showing lot of promise. HerKrithi Palu Vicharamuleof Annamacharya in Jhampe talam was neatly displayed with neraval and swaram.Swetha was accompanied by K. Rajan on the violin, Renuka Prasad on the mridangam, and Sridhara Chary on the ghatam. Rajan did well on the violin and Prasad, incidentally the husband of Swetha, matched well on the mridingam with anticipation along with Sridhar. Their tani was a treat to watch, contributing to the success of the concert.Swetha could have planned her concert better but nevertheless rendered items very well, such asPavana Guru Pavana Purain Hamsanandi.Emayya Ramain Khambhoji didn&#8217;t come in the right time. Her concluding items were a Ragamalika slokam followed byAkati Vellalain Thillang and a tillana in Behag. On the whole it was an unconventional concert. Swetha needs to work on the concert pattern as well as herpaatanthara, so that she can become a potential artiste.
