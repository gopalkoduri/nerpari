VVaranasi Sri Sowmya is the second artiste, the South Indian Cultural Association brought on to its stage as part of its young talents promotional concerts.A disciple of Neetha Chandrasekhar, her concert was held at the conference hall of the Ravindra Bharati last week.She was accompanied on this occasion by Pawan Singh on violin and a budding talent Ramakrishna on mridangam.Sowmya gave a traditional opening to her concert with a Thodi Raga varnam and then presentedVallabaha Nayakasyaof Dikshitar in Begada as an invocation. This was followed by Kanjadalayatakshi in Kamalamanohari and then went for a brief delineation of Charukesi and rendition ofKrupaya Palaya Gowriof Swathi Tirunal with a neatswarakalpana.There appeared later popular compositionsGanamurthein the Raga Ganamurthy andMarugelara O Raghavain Jayanthisri before she took up major raga Kalyani for expansion. She carefully built it in a textbook fashion. Her choice in this wasEnduko Neemanasurarely rendered these days.Thenerevaland theswarakalpanacarried the raga flavour. Pawan Singh&#8217;s contribution to theraga, nerevalandswaramadded lustre.O Jagadambain Anandabhairavi of Shyama Sastry too was a pleasant rendition in the latter part. Balamurali&#8217;s Tillana in Brindavana Saranga, a Tamil composition on Lord Muruga in Saveri and a rare Ramadasu kirtanaRavayya Abhayamuleeyavayyaset to music in Neelambari by Nedunuri Krishnamurthy were also notable in this part of her concert.Sowmya impressed in conveying her learning so far and will do well to give more time for practice to gain control, command and depth in her Carnatic classical expression.Another hitch was after the the openingvarnamthe mridangam player took long time to tune his instrument toshruti.
