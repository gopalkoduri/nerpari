VG. SWAMINATHANIt was an enchanting boquet of &#8216;Tamizh Isai&#8217; from young S.M.Vilasini at the Raga Sudha Hall, for Naada Inbam. She started with &#8216;Swami Naan Un Adimai&#8217; (pada varnam in Nattakurinji) and ended with the tillana in Revati by Lalgud\u000ai Jayaraman.Discipline and caution prevailed in Vilasini&#8217;s dulcet-voice presentation. Because of this, one might get an impression that Vilasini&#8217;s manodharma is restricted. Not exactly. Vilasini could distil the best in a raga or a composition while she articulated &#8216;Kondal Vannanai&#8217; in Harikhambodi followed by Kalki&#8217;s popular &#8216;Vandadum Solaithanile&#8217; and &#8216;Munnam Avanudaiya Naamam&#8217; (Thiruppathikam) in Keeravani as a lead-up to &#8216;Innamum Sandeha Padalamo&#8217;.These apart, Vilasini showed her originality in full form in the main raga, Thodi, in the latter section of her programme.The contours of Thodi were intensified on convincing traditional  pidis with extra lustre through her imaginative phrasings at the right junctures.&#8216;Gathi Neeye,&#8217; a composition with moving niraval at &#8216;Karunasaagaran Nee Andro&#8217; dwelt fully  on piety with passion.Many a Tamil song figured in her concert; &#8216;Sangeetha Devathe Saraswathi&#8217; in Mayamalavagowla (Ambujam Krishna), &#8216;Nanaganallur Ezhundarul&#8217; in Anandabhairavi (Papanasam Sivan), &#8216;En Palli Kondeerayya&#8217; in Mohanam and Kapi (Arunachala Kavi) were some special inclusions.The kalpanaswara segments were in  limited supply in Vilasini&#8217;s concert. Here also, her care came to the fore.Violinist Padma Shankar nurtured the concert with her calculated inputs in the alapana of Harikhambodi, Keeravani and Thodi. R Sankaranarayanan&#8217;s percussion was another good attribute to this programme.A piece of advice to Vilasini: Give a little more attention to the lyrics; &#8216;Kandu Enathullam&#8217; alternated between &#8216;Vandu Enathullam&#8217; in &#8216;Vandadum Solai,&#8217; &#8216;Pichchi&#8217; was pronounced as &#8216;Pichchai&#8217; in &#8216;Munnam Avan&#8217; viruttam and &#8216;Kalingan Mani Mudi Thaakki&#8217; went as &#8216;Thookki&#8217; in &#8216;En Palli Kondeer&#8217;.A word of appreciation for Ms. Jaya, daughter of the late S.V.Krishnan. Jaya seems to have picked up the same zest and sincerity of her father in organising concerts for Naada Inbam. Highly gratifying indeed.Bottom Template Starts
