VR ambhatla Nrusimha Sarma, the writer and compere of many a cultural event and winner of many awards including Nandi, has compiled 17 analytical articles with emphasis on an equal number of great personalities of Telugu cinema industry into book form and got it published. The book was released last week.S.P. Balasubrahmanyam releasing the book at VUDA Children's Theatre, said that derivation of wit, pun and placement of punctuation marks, seems to be the wont of Rambhatla. Hence, the book captioned Theraku Naa Ituvanti Seva (So/such is my service to the silver screen) makes its reading a source of relaxation.D.V. Surya Rao reviewing the contents of the book said that the book focuses on 17 Telugu cine personalities like, S.V. Ranga Rao, Savitri, Suryakantham, Bhanumathi, Kantha Rao, Atreya, Sobhanbabu, K. Viswanath, Bapu, Veturi, Gollapudi, Keeravani, Madhavapeddi Suresh, S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, Shavkaru Janaki, Gummadi and Akkineni Nageswara Rao.. But, replete with references of dozens of feature films including illustrations of dialogues from many films with photographs (about 250), the book stands as a cognizant study of the gleanings of contributions of hundreds of artistes who imparted everlasting glitter and glory to the silver screen from 1945 onwards, for about five decades, asserted Surya Rao.
