VThe Parthasarathy temple in Tiruvallikeni is said to be the oldest temple in Chennai city. Tiruvellikeni itself finds mention as a village even in the times of the ancient Pallava dynasty. And in this temple, with all its authenticity and grandeur, was the Brahmotsavam festival grand finale concert of Madurai T.N.\u000aSeshagopalan.The crowds that had\u000athronged the temple festivities\u000aorganically reorganised\u000athemselves to\u000atransform the space into a\u000aspiritual theatre. And thus\u000abegan the concert.It was common knowledge\u000athat TNS had returned\u000afrom a long American musical\u000atour barely twelve hours\u000abefore his concert, in one of\u000athe hottest days of the year.\u000aThere was natural curiosity\u000aof how he would cope with\u000athe circumstances. But as\u000athe concert progressed, it\u000abecame obvious that TNS\u000awould not disappoint, since\u000ahe would capture the traditional\u000aconnection between\u000aCarnatic music and its original\u000aproscenium, the temple.Evocative KaanadaEven as the concert began\u000awith and unfolded into\u000athe Dikshitar composition\u000aShanka Chakra (Purnachandrika),\u000athe Chalamela\u000avarnam (Nattakurunji)\u000aconcert had embedded itself\u000ain the universe of Parthasarathy.\u000aTNS enhanced\u000athe momentum with Ambujam\u000aKrishna's `Yenna\u000aSolli Azhaithai' that was\u000apreceded by a supremely\u000aevocative elaboration of raga\u000aKaanada followed by a\u000athematic virutham. `Keechu\u000aKeechendrengum' (Tiruppavai)\u000ain Bhairavi was\u000aan apt inclusion of Andal.\u000aThe next composition was\u000ato connect inevitably with\u000athe spatial significance of\u000athe temple. The offering\u000awas a slokam `Sarva Dharmaan\u000aParityajya,' the last\u000aof the Gitopadesam and is\u000acalled Charamasloka, highlighting\u000athe surrender of\u000athe devotee to the higher\u000aforce.This was followed by the\u000aelaborate `Bhagayanayya'\u000ain Chandrajyoti. This\u000awholesome offering meandered\u000afrom the raga elaboration\u000ato the niraval and\u000akalpana swaram.The line of the niraval\u000aimprovisation `Phalamu\u000aNeeku thanaku Laedhani\u000aChakkaga Paalanamu Seya\u000aLaedha' refers to theGita\u000asloka, (meaning, the action\u000aalone is your right and not\u000athe result). Even the anupallavi\u000ain the composition\u000arefers to the karmanyevaadhikaarsthe\u000amaa phaleshu\u000akadhaachan Gitopadesa\u000asloka (meaning, there\u000ais nothing to be done for\u000ame, or my own sake in all\u000athe three worlds). TNS\u000acould not have made a\u000abetter offering to the philosophical\u000asymbolism of\u000athe presiding deity.All the exquisite viruthams\u000asuch as `Palliyil Othi\u000aVanthadhor Siruvan' (Thirumangai\u000aAzhwar Pasuram)\u000aabout Thiruvallikeni\u000adeity and `Shanka Chakra\u000a(Draupadi Maana Samrakshana\u000aslokam were thematic\u000ato the metaphors of\u000athe temple. TNS chose to\u000aeven conclude the concert\u000awith a thematic mangalam\u000a`Vijaya Gopala' by Narayana\u000aTirtha.Vittal Ramamurthy on\u000athe violin and Ganapathy\u000aRaman on the mridangam\u000aharmonised faultlessly\u000awith the theme and texture\u000aof the concert.The concert and its ambience\u000atransported even\u000athe average connoisseur\u000a(and perhaps even the\u000anon-believer!) to a world\u000aof yore when culture, spirituality\u000aand intellectual\u000agenius merged with organic\u000aease. TNS demonstrated\u000athat he is a unique\u000abearer of a musical tradition\u000athat can revitalise the\u000atranscended significance\u000aof a space called the\u000atemple.
