VThe contemporary milieu in which the words character, dignity, decorum, culture, human and moral values and ethics have become just meaningless platitudes, the President of India, A.P.J Abdul Kalam, is a beacon, touching millions of our countrymen with rare brilliance and effervescence.Secular to the core, Dr. Kalam's perceptive insights into the Koran,  the Bhagavad Gita, the Bible, Valluvar's Tirukkural and so on  have singled him out as one of a kind.His multi-faceted achievements in varied spheres emphasise  Dr. Kalam's total dedication, determination and discipline that have governed his entire life and illustrious career. His prowess as a poet and his passion for music and fine arts, are well reflected in his songs that are spontaneous outpourings of the soul.Oriental Records Inc., New York, U. S.  released on April 27  at the Rashtrapathi Bhavan, New Delhi, a CD album comprising two songs of Dr. Kalam and another by Dr. Y.S. Rajan, who apart from being a renowned scientist, is also an educationist, poet, litterateur and administrator. Dr. Kalam's "Manidha Jadhiye" is infused with a mood of contemplation and introspection, pondering about the mysteries of man's temporary sojourn on this planet.Homage to mother"Annaiye, Annaiye" that pays homage to the composer's mother for facing the trials and tribulations of life with a firmness of purpose to set her family on track, does activate the lachrymal glands. Dr. Y.S. Rajan's "Kutti Maane, Kutti Maane", a eulogy to Dr. Kalam, highlights the President's strength of character, concern for humanity, and his fierce desire to raise the quality quotient of life in general, and the less favoured in particular.Rangasami Parthasarathi, who also produced the audio volume, is  a consummate music composer. He has set the melody for the lyrics in captivating ragas and light tunes that are in keeping with the emotional substance underlining the verses. S. P. Balasubramaniam's musical rendition of "Manidha Jadhiye" and "Kutti Maane" internalising each micro-tone, is as soft and soothing as a lullaby."Annaiye, Annaiye", a ragamalika in Todi, Vakhulabharanam, Kalyani, Nilambari and Sekharachandrika sung by the dulcet-voiced P. Unnikrishnan, with focus on clear diction and involvement is an exemplary interpretation that does ample justices to the lyrics.Dr. Abdul Kalam's 75th birthday falls on October 15,  and this audio album is a timely, welcome production by Oriental Records in anticipation of the happy event. The CD is distributed in India by Bharat Records International Pvt. Ltd., Gopalapuram. (Ph: 91-044-2835 3674/2835 1214).SULOCHANA PATTABHIRAMANBottom Template Starts
