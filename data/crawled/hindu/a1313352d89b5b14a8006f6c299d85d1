VPollachi Tamizhisai Sangam featured vocalists A. Akshaya and K. Prashanthi under the auspices of Tamilnadu Iyal Isai Nadaga Mandram at Mahatma Gandhi Mandapam, Pollachi.A disciple of Guruvayur T.V. Manikandan, Akshaya is blessed with a rich and clear voice that has a great reach.She began with the Pantuvarali varnam, &#8216;Saami Nee Thodi&#8217; by Nagapatnam Veeraswamy Pillai. &#8216;Sivakaama Sundari&#8217; in Jaganmohini, &#8216;Saravanabhava Guhane&#8217; in Kanada, &#8216;Nekkurugi&#8217; in Abhogi and &#8216;Unnadiye Gathiyendradainthen&#8217; in Bahudhari were some of the pleasing kritis which she presented.While singing Poorvikalyani, Kharaharapriya and Kalyani, the raga bhava was intact, but spontaneity was missing. Akshaya will do well to do some homework in the improvisational aspects of her music.Srividhya R.S. Iyer, who is equally adept at vocal music and violin is the daughter of Gita Ramasubramanian (one of the Mayavaram sisters). Senior violinist Lalitha Raghavan has trained her with care and Srividhya&#8217;s raga delineation and swaraprastharas bore witness to this fact.T.Arul on the mridangam provided adequate support.The following day, Dr. K.Prashanthi gave a wholesome vocal recital. She began with Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s padavarnam &#8216;Devar Munivar&#8217; in Shanmukhapriya that had instant appeal.Poorvikalyani and Kalyani featured in her concert, though the treatment of the ragas showed the kind of training she has received from the veterans such as Suguna Purushothaman.After a delightful delineation of Poorvikalyani, she sang &#8216;Ksheera Sagara Sayee&#8217; by Papanasam Sivan. &#8216;Muruga Muruga Endraal&#8217; and &#8216;Sri Vaathapi Ganapathiye&#8217; were presented neatly.&#8216;Aadinathu Eppadiyo&#8217; by Muthu Thandavar in Kalyani was the main piece and also the piece de resistance. The lighter session comprised such favourites as &#8216;Aarabhimaanam&#8217;, &#8216;Kaana Vendaamo&#8217; and &#8216;Sabhapathikku&#8217;.Shreya Narayanan on the violin and Prasanna Karthikeyan on the mridangam did full justice to their roles.
