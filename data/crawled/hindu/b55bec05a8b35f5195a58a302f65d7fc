V&#8220;Intellectual terror&#8221;, an expression which would mean something much more political, historically played a crucial role in the evolution of Hungarian jazz music.As a musical style, foreign in origin, jazz music in Hungary outlived the communist era, and today commands respect globally.The Hungarian jazz concert recently  was a befitting beginning to the  cultural extravaganza  &#8216;Magyar Masala&#8217;  organised by the Hungarian Information and Cultural Centre in Delhi.Two of the most renowned jazz musicians and veteran piano players, Bela Szakcsi Lakatos and Gyorgy Vukan, performed together, along with the Dresch quartet from Hungary, comprising  the bassist Matyas Szandai, the brilliant drummer Istvan Balo, and Miklos Lukacsi on the piano.The duo of Szakcsi Lakatos and Vukan has been performing together for more than three decades. On the day, both of them set off by acquainting the Delhi audience with individual numbers to set the mood for the magical improvisations later on. Meanwhile,The Dresch quartet, who performed in turns with the duo, is known in Hungary for its brilliant combinations of Gypsy and Balkan folk music with fusion jazz. They do this usually by using some typical folk instruments like the cimbalom (akin to the santoor), and a unique kind of flute used largely in the Transylvanian region.The podium jazz was born in Hungary after the failed revolution of 1956, when socialism became softer in the region.The effect of progressive musical styles had to wait till the dawn of the &#8217;70s, by which mainstream and popular jazz came  into vogue. Szakcsi Lakatos added in defence of European jazz, &#8220;No one disputes that jazz comes from America, but some Americans are reluctant to admit that there&#8217;s such a thing as European jazz. My music is inevitably modern and draws on a special Gypsy tradition.&#8221;He added, &#8220;What is very special about the Gypsy bands is the uncanny time-keeping combined with the freedom of playing rubato. Any jazzman who has ever heard a Gypsy band is always amazed by it.&#8221;Szakcsi Lakatos and Vukan, who had performed at prestigious festivals in Europe and North America, have both a major share in popularising fusion jazz in Europe.They have also been engaged in collecting treasures of Gypsy folklore, especially Szakcsi Lakatos, who re-interpreted these musical pieces as either stage works or by fusing them with jazz music.His oeuvre includes operas, musicals and ballets. The duo, in characteristic mutual rapport, improvised jazz on the basis of well-known Hungarian folk songs. The audience could feel the musical dialogue building up on the stage between the two maestros.The Indian presence in this Hungarian jazz concert added the &#8216;masala&#8217; to the Magyar music in the form of the young tabla player Mohit Lal, who plays in popular bands like Advaita and Sounds Like Soul.Though he came towards the end, the combination of the Dresch quartet and the two pianists amazingly matched with the ethnic pulse of Mohit Lal&#8217;s strokes on the tabla.
