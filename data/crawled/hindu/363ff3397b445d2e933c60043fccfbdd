VVisakha Music Academy featured concerts by a violin trio comprising Padma Shri M.S. Gopalakrishnan, his daughter M. Narmada and son M.S.G. Suresh Kumar &#8212; both in the Carnatic and Hindustani dictions last Saturday and Sunday at Kalabharathi.For the first recital, they were accompanied by K. Sadugurcharan of Vijayawada on the mridangam and S. Hanumantha Rao of T.P. Gudem on the ghatam. The repertoire for the evening mainly comprised Sankarabharanam varnam, Siddhivinayakam (Shanmukhapriya) concluced with elaborate swaram in the two tempos, Goula Pancharatnakrithi of Thyagaraja prefixed with brief alapana, elaborate presentation of Sankari Neeve (Begada), Ye thaavuna ra (Kalyani) and Yevarura ninu vina (Mohana). Despite the disappointment that Gopalakrishnan himself did not take much initiative in rendering the manodharma part to adorn raga, neravu and swaram, it left an overall impression of being an engaging concert.The following evening, the father and daughter in the company of Najmuddin Javed of Hyderabad on tabla rendered a scholarly and soothing Hindustani recital. A khayal in Sudhkalyan with the badabhav rendered in Bilambit Ektal and the chotabhav in Dhruth Teental was rendered to start with. Sharing every aspect of the build-up raga and the compositons adorned with swaras, Narmada proved to be a peer of her father and exhibited exemplary ambidexterity playing on the violin.After playing rag, jore and jhal in Jog, they together exquisitely played Masadkhani (composition set in roopaktal) and Rayakhani (Dhruth Teental). A composition in Misramaund followed by bhajan Jogee Muthjaa constituted the grand finale.
