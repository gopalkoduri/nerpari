VIt looks as if the music season fever has not yet caught on, going by the sparsely crowded Tapovan Hall of Chinmaya Heritage Trust.The first concert of the series, Geetha Rajasekar&#8217;s vocal recital was quite feisty and skilful. She enjoyed the excellent company of efficient, experienced and talented artists such as Mysore Srikanth on the violin, Neyveli Skandasubramaniam on the mridangam and Adambakkam Sankar on the ghatam. It was good team work where every one contributed to the success of the programme.&#8216;Bhaja Manasa Vigneswara&#8217; of Tulasivanam in Bahudari provided a perfect and energetic start. To add verve, Geetha suffixed the kriti with a variety of swara patterns fixing on gandharam. The second on the line was &#8216;Ninne Nera Nammi&#8217; of Tyagaraja in Pantuvarali where Geetha sang  niraval and swaras at &#8216;Veda Sasthra Purana&#8217;.Hemavathi (referred as Desisimharavam in Dikshitar&#8217;s school) and &#8216;Sri Kanthimathim&#8217; of Muthuswami Dikshitar can never fail a performer. The raga essay Geetha had drawn for Hemavathi was a  testimony of her faith in making her exercise attractive with the right blend of repose and briga oriented phrases.&#8216;Deva Jagannada&#8217; in Kalyanavasantham by Gopalakrishna Bharati exuded a rare and special charm. Geetha&#8217;s experience has strengthened her presentation technique.Mysore Srikanth professionally approached every item  and the Hemavathi raga vinyasa and the brisk sets of swaras in Pantuvarali and Bahudari were catchy. Skandasubramaniam and Sankar were perfect in their percussion hold.
