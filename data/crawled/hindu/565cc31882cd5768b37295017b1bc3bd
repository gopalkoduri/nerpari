He began the concert with his ownvarnamin NataiSaptaswaramulu.Sidhi, a newragamfounded by the maestro with only fourswaramsin it was the next wherein he sang a small invocatorySidhim Dehi. Nadavarangaini, a  creation of Thyagaraja was chosen forKripalavala,a rare item and it was sung in his own way. Karnataka Kapi was taken for Syamasastry&#8217;sAkhilandeswari Durusuga,another rare item. Chandrajyothi was taken for an essay and here his class act was distinctly heard.His style of theragamwas unique and theragabhavamwas brilliant forBagayanayya.Bhairavi was taken next and theragamthough briefly sung was a bit unconventional to hear.Bala Gopalaof Deekshitar was a  class composition and he delivered it in his own style with complexswaram. The major attraction of the evening was the famous ThyagarajaPancharathnakriti Endaro Mahaanubhavuluin Sree Ragam.  One of the great aspects was that he could   singswarain the three octaves effortlessly and effectively make a clear edge over others. His base voice was as bright as his top voice and he proved that only he can sing like this.  D.V.Mohan Krishna gave the vocal support, (maestro&#8217;s disciple) young Dinakar on violin was playing for the first time along with the maestro, the veteran mridangam player M.L.N.Raju, Nemani on ghatam and Satya Sai was on morsing.
