VVocalist Arati Ankalikar's outstanding performance for Bharat Sangeet Utsav 2009, exemplified her mastery over rhythm and melody, and also showcased the best of Agra Gwalior and Jaipur Atrauli Gharanas.Arati began her recital with an innovative Madhuvanti vilambit roopak, where she exhibited her creativity. She presented fresh melodic phrases in varying tempos. Furthermore, upon reaching sam, she introduced an unexpected rhythmic swing.Keen musical insightArati has a keen musical insight, and continually identifies potential departure points in a bandish, to elaborate upon. She is adept at mixing styles with ease. In the badhat in the dhrut piece, she executed the bols in the Jaipur style, while the sapaat taans were executed in the Gwalior style.A case in point was her performance of Puriya Dhanashree; the composition not only displayed the complexity of her style, but also the extraordinary restraint she can exercise.Her presentation of the tarana was subtle. Each step of the raga imbued the evening with intellectual stimulation.Towards the end, Arati presented &#8216;Maare Ghar Aayoji,' a Meera bhajan in Bhojpuri. It was a typical piece from the Marwa region and had strong traces of the gayaki of Kumar Gandharav. She took several tans in Akkar, modulating her voice to create an aesthetic impact. The only thing that undermined the bhakti &#8216;bhava' that the bhajan is supposed to generate was the technical excellence. Two students of Bombay Jayashree provided the required refrain.Arati's rendition spoke volumes of her training under Pt.Vasant Rao Kulkarni of Gwalior gharana and Kishori Amonkar of the Jaipur Atrauli gharana.Vyas Murthy Kutti on the harmonium and Vishwanath Nakod on the tabla played with great flourish and provided the required support to Arati.
