VGARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMSinging during the commemoration of the golden jubilee of the Sri Sadguru Sangeetha Samajam, Purasavakkam, on Saturday last, Sita Narayanan seemed to draw inspiration from the serene ambience at the Sankaramath in West Mambalam.Dedicated to the propagation of Tyagaraja's glorious legacy, her recital was part of the 50 performances sponsored by the samajam in five locations in Chennai.Careful planningSita Narayanan's selection of compositions was carefully planned to showcase some of the less heard kritis of the saint composer, as well as to rediscover the evergreen quality of the more popular ones.`Anupama Gunambudhi' in Atana was an introduction to Sita Narayanan's vibrant voice and ``Nidhichala sukhama" in Kalyani some evidence of her mastery over raga exposition.``Okamata okabanam" was her choice kriti in Harikhambodi. A welcome surprise for listeners more used to hearing two other kritis of Tyagaraja on the concert stage.Again, ``Nee daya" in Reethigowla was the other unexpected piece.Mullaivasal G. Chandramowli on the violin and Thanjavur Subramaniam on the mridangam lent excellent support to Sita Narayanan whom listeners should have a chance to hear for much longer than the 90 minutes that she was featured in the series.Bottom Template Starts
