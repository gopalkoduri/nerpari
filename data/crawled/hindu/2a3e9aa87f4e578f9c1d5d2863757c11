VREPUTED VOCALIST Manda Sudharani presented a recital as part of the special ceremonies organised by Sri Sankara Matham of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Maha Samsthanam on the occasion of Srikantha Jayanthi in Vishakapatnam.The rendering of the `Natakuranji varnam' "Chalamela" followed by the vibrant rendering of the `Gambhiranata krithi', "Sri Jaalandharamaasrayami" of Dikshitar and "Ilalopranataadri Harudanuchu" of Thyagaraja, both embellished with thrilling `swarakalpana' set an excitingly absorbing mood. The expansive elaboration of "Pasupateeswaram" (`Subhapantuvarali') of Dikshitar followed by evocative rendering of "Sarasasamadana" of Thyagaraja (`Kapinarayani') created an evocative gusto.Again an elaboration on similar lines of "Evaruraninuvina" of the same composer (Thyagaraja) turned out to be a scholarly and wholesome treat of Carnatic music.The `aalapana' and `swarakalpana' replete with knowledgeable `sangathis' of eruditely balanced phraseology with appropriate stress on the `jeevaswaras' delighted the initiated in particular.Vankayala Venkata Ramana Murty executing well-chosen `jathis' and Sudharani's guru Ivaturi Vijayeswara Rao surfacing remarkably complementing `sangathis' while playing in tandem pleased all alike.The responses of `aalapana' and `swarakalpana' in his turns by Vijayeswara Rao and the `thani' executed with acumen and élan by Ramana Murthy with the laudable support on kanjira by Mandapaka Ravi contributed splendour and tended the recital a sumptuous feast.The secretary of the management committee Susarla Suryanarayana Murthy, proposing a vote of thanks, rightly observed that the recital proved to be a rich tribute to Dikshitar also as the day coincided with his `jayanthi' as well.A.R.S.Bottom Template Starts
