VPundits and rasikas considered Manjapara Devesa Ramanathan a true-blue musician. His art was fired by a rare stimulation, traditional to the core, yet one that opened up fresh vistas, perhaps until then unexplored. His body language and mannerisms may have evoked an amused  smile or two but once his music took hold, the auditorium was transformed into a place of worship. Ramanthan's live concert at the Music Club, 30 odd years ago, has been recorded by Charsur, in two compact discs.The programme with Chalakudy Narayanaswami on the violin and Vellore Ramabhadran on the mridangam, is introduced in style by Garbapuri Vasar's Adi tala avarnam in Sri Ragam with a few avartanams of kalpanaswaras in the charanam.Dikshitar's `Angarakama Srayamyaham' in Surutti, invoking the blessings of Angaraka, one of the Navagrahas, is an example of how even a mere song version can rise above the level of mediocrity and sustain auditory attention.The description of Abhogi, studded with melodic prayogas in the chowka kala, the reposeful rendering of `Nannu Brova' of Tyagaraja and the flowing, simple sarvalaghu swaras in the pallavi find the listener's approval in good measure.Kalyani is developed in masterly fashion with grace and poise, and more importantly with total sruti unison. Unfortunately, the second CD comprises the same agenda as  the first, and hence the reviewer is unable to proceed further.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
