VPREMA NANDAKUMARSri Sharadamba Navarathri Stotram (Bhakti Sudha Tarangini) -Sanskrit Hymns of Sri Sachidananda Shivabhinava Nrisimha Bharati Maha Swamigal-Rendered by: Hyderabad Brothers-Rs 125.Produced by the Chityala Family of New York as a CD, Sri Sharadamba Stotram (Bhakti Sudha Tarangini) fulfils a long-felt need to give a musical tone to the hymns of the 33rd pontiff of Sringeri Math.It was in 1913 that the Acharya's earnest disciple, T. K. Balasubramaniam published from Sri Vani Vilas Press, Srirangam, the poetic compositions of the Acharya for the first time. A new edition came out in 1981.Living legendSri Nrisimha Bharati was a living legend. A master of sastras, benign Guru and the discoverer of Adi Sankara's birthplace at Kaladi, the Acharya has also included very fine Sanskrit stotras on Vinayaka and Sri Sharadamba.In these poems the visible deity as an enchanting Mother Goddess is described with the love of a child while the veiled powers of Sri Sharada are indicated with Advaitic fervour. Cast in the sublime mode, it is no easy task to set the verses to the ragas and rhythms of Carnatic music.The Hyderabad Brothers have bravely accepted the challenge and their success is no doubt attributable to the grace of the Guru.Culled from the one hundred and sixty three slokas of Sri Sarada Stotram describing the Navaratri festival at Sringeri, the CD projects the ten vahanas used during the festivities.After invoking Sri Sarada as the Mother Creatrix, the Acharya begins with Hamsa Vahana.Desiring Realisation, aspirants should surrender at Her feet as she rides the Swan, the Bull, the Peacock, Garuda, the Deer, the Lion, the Horse, the Elephant, the Parrot; each mount has a particular significance bringing illumination to the onlooker.Thus the Parrot (Suka) is aglow, because Transcendental wisdom has taken on the image of Sri Sarada.She is seen in the Padmasana when riding the chariot, as one performing yoga to save her devotees from the ocean of Samsara.The CD concludes with three verses indicating the inner meaning of the Navaratri experience.The various vahanas and ornamentation indicate that Sri Sarada is one who puts on several forms to teach us the higher knowledge. Her eyes shed compassion while Varuna and other gods of the directions salute her. What is that we need fear when she is with us?The Hyderabad Brothers bring a very clear enunciation of the Sanskrit verses and use ragas like Hamsadhwani, Hamsanadham, Kalyani and Mohanam.The glory of these classical ragas and the grandeur of the Sanskrit diction blend very well. When their voices are joined by Jayasree and Gayatri in unhurried recitation, the listener finds it easy to memorise the verses.A listing of the ragas would help young listeners to stick to the correct sanchara instead of indulging in guesswork.Also a Sanskrit introduction, however brief, from Sri Bharati Theertha Mahaswamigal would further enhance the value of the recitations as the present Acharya is well known for his simple and eloquent Sanskrit speeches.Copies are available at Dakshinamnaya Sri Sharada Peetham, Sringeri 577139 and Sri Sringeri Sankara Math, 97, Ammamandapam Road, Srirangam, Tiruchi - 620 006.Bottom Template Starts
