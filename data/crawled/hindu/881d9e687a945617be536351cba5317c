VA senior violinist that he is, V.V. Subramaniam&#8217;s maturity in music seems to be inclined towards his understanding of the philosophical contents in songs. That is what he made  known in his solo concert with his son V.V.S.Murari at the festival jointly arranged by Carnatica and Sri Parthasarathy Swamy Sabha.The exposition, in his view, sought to bring out his mind in an emphatic way within the confines of a conventional concert.His mastery over the instrument was impeccable. His virtuoso was well revealed by his fingering felicity, deep toned in Vilambakala and fleeting in the durita passages. Not hackneyed, his raga vinyasas of Lalita (&#8216;Nannu Brovu Lalita&#8217;), Sama (&#8216;Anna Poorne&#8217;) and Gamakakriya in Dikshitar nomenclature (&#8216;Meenakshi Me Mudam&#8217;) were framed in such a manner as to convey what according to him, nada is all about. They were inspirational in that direction sustained by his search for spiritual perspective.The choice of his songs, &#8216;Maha Ganapathim&#8217; (Nattai) and &#8216;Nada Tanum Anisam&#8217; (Chittaranjani) besides the three items already mentioned were also on the same lines as his alapana motivation. In the matter of exchange of sancharas between him and Murari and in swaraprastharas, there was energetic positivism towards maintaining tempo of the recital. While still adhering to traditional orthodoxy Subramaniam&#8217;s play suggested that exposition was in essence a musician&#8217;s individuality marked by what ideals he feels worthy of pursuit.Tiruvarur Bhaktavatsalam (mridangam) teamed with Vaikkom Gopalakrishnan (ghatam) in his thani presented his version of percussive nada.
