VSankaran Namboothiri's vocal recital at the annual festival of Sri Navaneetha Gopalakrishnaswamy temple at Ambikapuram, Palakkad, was notable for its deep musical expressions and emotional content. Taking full advantage of his resonant voice, he imparted depth to his renditions. Befitting the occasion, he sang quite a number of compositions on Srikrishna.Starting with &#8216;Gajavadana Paaliso,' a kriti of Vijaya Vittaladas in Hamsadhwani, he proceeded to Tyagaraja's &#8216;Aelaneedayaraadhu' in Ataana, suffixing it with fine swarakalpana. His alapana of Mohanam was well crafted, with graceful &#8216;akaaras' and &#8216;brigas.' The portrayal of Dikshitar's &#8216;Gopika manoharam' and the appended swaraprastharas were praiseworthy.Sankaran's keen sense of &#8216;sahitya' was discernible in his energetic presentation of Vasudevachar's &#8216;Bhajare re maanasa' in Abheri. Preceded by a neat sketch of Hindolam, he gave a pleasing version of &#8216;Govardhana Gireesam,' a kriti of Dikshitar, adorned with a plethora of kalpanaswaras. After a vibrant &#8216;Raghuvamsasudha' (Kadanakuthoohalam-Patnam Subramanya Iyer) and a moving &#8216;Marive' (Anadhabhairavi-Syama Sastri), the vocalist brought out the multifaceted hues of Kamboji. Violinist Ambulappuzha Pradeep responded well, with a melodious essay of the raga. Taking up Oothukadu Venkata Kavi's majestic composition &#8216;Kuzhaloothi Manamellam,' he presented a vivacious niraval at the charanam &#8216;Makarakundala,' followed by a garland of beautifully conceived swara patterns.&#8216;Varuvai Varuvai Kanna' in Kaapi, &#8216;Paarvai onrae podhume' in Surutti (Oothukadu Venkata Kavi), &#8216;Tamboori meetithava' in Sindhubhairavi (Purandaradasa) and &#8216;Eppovaruvaro' in Jonpuri (Gopalakrishna Bharathi), rendered in the concluding session, were rich in aesthetic melody. Sankaran rounded off the concert with a Hamsaanandhi thillana of Muthaiah Bhagavathar. Balakrishna Kamath gave a sprightly display on the mridangam. Kovai Suresh (ghatam) extended adequate support. Their &#8216;tani,' though a bit elongated, was enjoyable.Full of bhavaOn another day of the festival, up-and-coming vocalist Shobana showed promise. With a pleasing stage presence, she infused bhava in her renditions. The opening varnam of Patnam Subramanya Iyer, &#8216;Evaribodha' in Abhogi, followed by the popular Diksitar kritis &#8216;Vaataapi Ganapathim' (Hamsadhwani) and &#8216;Swaminatha paripaalaya' (Natta) set a good pace. Papanasam Sivan's &#8216;Balakrishnan Paadamalar' was preceded by a delectable version of Dhanyasi.The brisk &#8216;Brovabharama' (Bahudhari-Tyagaraja) and the emotive &#8216;Akhilandeswari' (Dwijawanthi-Dikshitar) were an ideal prelude to a detailed elaboration of Pantuvaraali, which was punctuated with copious gamakas. Swati Tirunal's &#8216;Sarasaksha' was portrayed gracefully, with a fine niraval and kalpana swaras.Papanaasam Sivan's &#8216;Thunai purindarul' in Varamu, Subramanya Bharathiyar's &#8216;Aasai mugam marandhu poche' in Jonpuri and Lalgudi Jayaraman's thillana in Maand were well received.Sobhana had a competent team of accompanists. Extending splendid support, Nedumangaadu Sindhu (violin) excelled in raga delineations and swara prastharas.Palakkad Ganesan showcased his maturity and expertise in his subtle mridangam accompaniment. Along with the agile Deepu (ghatam), he presented a crisp tani.
