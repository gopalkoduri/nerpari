VFor regular readers of short stories in Tamil, Pooram Sathyamoorthy should be a familiar name. Pooram Short Story Lover&#8217;s Club is doing its mite to keep the writer&#8217;s flag flying.The club&#8217;s latest venture is the release of a collection of Pooram&#8217;s four prize-winning short stories as an audio CD. It is an innovative attempt with veteran theatre person Bombay Kannan at the helm.Acting out short stories is the norm. But making it a narrative, interspersed with the dialogue of characters spoken by different actors, gives it an interesting dimension.&#8220;The appeal of Pooram&#8217;s Sathyamoorthy&#8217;s stories lies in his themes which are as varied as the fragrance of various flowers,&#8221; describes co-ordinator P. Venkataraman at the beginning of the CD, &#8216;Nalam Tharum Soll,&#8217; which runs to nearly two and half hours.Brought out in MP3 format, the audio is directed by Bombay Kannan.As Sathyamoorthy himself notes in the introduction to the CD, each of the four stories &#8212; &#8216;Nalam Tharum Soll,&#8217; &#8216;Sankaram,&#8217; &#8216;Sthala Vriksham&#8217; and &#8216;Andhi Vaelai,&#8217; &#8212; are different from one another in style and content. If &#8216;Nalam &#8230;&#8217; a story he wrote in 1968, has more of surrealism, narrative style is the highlight of &#8216;Sankaram&#8217; and brother-sister bonding comes out loud and clear in &#8216;Sthala Vriksham,&#8217; while &#8216;Andhi Vaelai,&#8217; is an appealing take on love.Bombay Kannan, Karur Rangaraj, Ramanan, Sathyamoorthy, Gnanam, Bharani, Brindha and Radha, have given their voices for the four stories.But why do they often oscillate between colloquial and chaste Tamil? It distracts the attention of the listener.&#8220;Kindly send me your feedback,&#8221; exhorts the veteran writer in his CD.For copies contact  Pooram Short Story Lover&#8217;s Club, No.18, South Mada St., Triplicane, Chennai - 600005.
