VThe 22nd Devnandan Yuva Utsav commenced with a Hindustani classical vocal recital by the young Pushkar Lele, an immensely talented disciple of Pt. Vijay Sardeshmukh, a senior disciple of the late Pt. Kumar Gandharva. Pushkar&#8217;s gayaki has evolve\u000ad from a meticulous study of the musical ideology of late Pt Kumar Gandharva. This fact was manifestly evident in Pushkar&#8217;s vocal recital. Pushkar Lele chose the popular evening melody Rag Yaman and rendered a bandish in Jhoomra, a medium tempo rhythmic cycle of 14 beats. His delineation of the rag, be it the manner of presentation (swar lagav), mode of presentation (dhang) or hawk like swoops (aaghat), his vocalism carried that typical Kumar Gandharva Mystique. His taankari in the drut teen tal composition &#8220;Laya sur tum shoka bina&#8221; were flawless and had a feathery feel but the lower register was rather feeble and he could not delve effectively into the mandra saptak. This was followed by an adha teen tal bandish &#8220;Motiya gulab&#8221; in rag Tilak Kamod, a melody which bears a close resemblance to the rag Desh. Pushkar embellished this bandish with exquisite gamaks.  Prashant Gowda and Keshav Joshi provided the harmonium and tabla accompaniment respectively.Pandit Parameshwar Hegde&#8217;s promising disciple Koushik Aithal began the next day&#8217;s sessions. Piu Mukherjee, a disciple of the thumri queen Girija Devi presented Rag Gurjari Todi. The vilambit ek tal bandish, in the sthayi &#8220;Ab more ram jagat adhar&#8221; unfolded with a delectable sense of leisurely, unhurried alap, and the rich, sonorous, highly melodious quality of her voice came through in her exposition of the antara part &#8220;Bhav rang jal me karo mori naiyya par&#8221;, resonating with the signature style of Girija Devi. However, the khyal rendition lacked consistency. Piu Mukherjee&#8217;s sargams faltered in certain places. Her sapat taans were tediously repetitive at times. The rendition of the Drut teen tal composition was marked by elan and gusto.This was followed by a tappa in rag Bhairavi, set to adha teentaal.  The melodic effervescence of the &#8216;tappa&#8217; did not really come alive in Piu Mukherjee&#8217;s hurried and truncated presentation. Mahalakshmi Shenoy&#8217;s vocal recital &#8211; a disciple of the mohan veena maestro Pt Vishwa Mohan Bhat &#8211; began with Rag Bhinna Shadja.The bandish in drut teen tal &#8220;Tadpe mora jiya balma&#8221; was rather a tepid delineation which had some redeeming flashes. The concluding concert was  by Uday Bhawalkar, the star dsciple of the famous Dagar brothers. Pt. Uday Bhawalkar chose rag Yaman Kalyan for his exposition. He began with a free flowing delineation of the raga&#8217;s melodic personality, structured in consonance with the well-established rules of melodic progression. This vilambit alap in vocal rendition uses meaningless consonants such as ta, na, ri as articulation. Bhawalkar explored the rag in both the sthayi, lower half of the melodic canvas and the antara, in the upper half with improvisations around the tonic accompanied by phrases highlighting the raga beyond reasonable doubt.The three tiered alaap moved in a meandering fashion to the more incantatory medium and fast tempo jod-jhala corresponding to its equivalents in instrumental music. In his nom tom alap exposition (a phonetic remnant of what was once a rhythmic chanting of the name of Lord Vishnu - Om hari anata narayana), Pt. Bhawalkar was ably supported by his young disciples Chintan and Sagar.This was followed by a scintillating Pakhawaj accompaniment by Sukhad Munde for the chautal (12 beats) composition in Yaman Kalyan, &#8220;Jagat Ho Tihari, Dasa Janam Janam, Hamare Dukha Niwaro&#8221;. The lyrical prayer rendered with majestic, meditative poise in digun, tigun and chaugun (rhythmic variations) successively by Bhawalkar cast a hypnotic spell on the audience.
