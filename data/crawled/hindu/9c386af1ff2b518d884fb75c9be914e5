VA classical music concert by the Trichur Brothers, Srikrishna Mohan and Ramkumar Mohan, at  Hari Sri Vidya Nidhi School Auditorium,  was a kind of gurudakshina.They began the concert  with the evocative &#8216;Maatey&#8217; in raga Khamas. This set the mood for the evening. &#8216;Mahaganapathim&#8217; in raga Nata saw the concert proceed to full swing. The Swati Tirunal composition &#8216;Kanakeyavasana&#8217; in raga Hameer Kalyani had a  lilting cadence to it. In contrast, &#8216;Koluvaiunade&#8217; in Devagandhari was brisk and vigorous.Srikrishna and Ramkumar did full justice to the ragam tanam pallavi routine in raga Vrindavani. They explored the nuances of the raga in both the high and low registers. The violin interlude conveyed the gentle  tempo of the composition.&#8216;Nanuvidachi,&#8217; a Tyagaraja composition in raga Reethigowla, is soaked inbhakti-bhavaas the composer-saint implores  Rama not to leave him even for a moment. The brothers&#8217; rendering  created a meditative atmosphere. The popular &#8216;Raghuvamsa Sudha&#8217; in raga Kathanakuthuhalam, with its peppy, undulating glide, perked up the concert.The brothers sang with  gay abandon .The accompanying artistes participated with verve; the mridangam complementing the sheer joy of the song. At the end, the music and the rhythm reached a crescendo of synchronisation.A magnificent presentation of Thodi was the high point of the concert. The Dikshitar composition &#8216;Srikrishnam Bhaje&#8217; showed a slightly unusual facet of the majestic raga.The singers displayed their mastery and skill in the way they methodically built up the fabric of Thodi, venturing daringly into Kalyani and returning effortlessly.The versatile niraval at &#8216;Shankhu Chakra Gada Padmam&#8217; proved their prowess in the  creative component of a musical presentation.The lively banter between the violin and the percussion instruments absorbed the attention of the audience.The concert reached its zenith in the presentation of Thodi.The  devout &#8216;Pibaraey Rama Rasam,&#8217; in raga Ahir Bhairav, preceded by a stirring sloka, ushered in a  welcome change in tempo. Srikrishna and Ramkumar won hearts with their classical and innovative portrayal of the school song in Yamuna Kalyani.The concert ended with an exuberant thillana in Poorvikalyani, a composition of M.D Ramanathan.M.A. Sundaresan on the violin and Udupi Sridhar on the ghatom kept pace with Thrikakkara Y.N. Santharam on the ganjira. Trichur Mohan accompanied his sons on the mridangam.The Trichur Brothers have proved that  they are names to watch out for in the years to come.
