VBalamurali Sangeeta Lahari, a three-day music workshop at Saptaparni was a feast for music enthusiasts. Conducted by Prince Rama Varma, a Carnatic vocalist and veena player par excellence, it was a blessing for those who could attended the same. As the name suggests it was a workshop on the compositions of Dr. Balalmuralikrishna. Prince Rama Varma, a disciple of Balamurali taught a few compositions of his Guru. The compositions he chose were in different languages Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, and Sanskrit and he taught them with the same ease and &#233;lan.He explained every word which gave a new dimension to singing, making it more enjoyable for the singer as well as the rasikas. The first song was Vasama Nee Atisaya mahima in one of the 72 &#8216;Melakarta' Ragas, Raga Dharmavati set in Adi Tala. This was a song composed by Balamurali, as a boy of 16.Listening to Rama Varma, one can get convinced that a song need not be filled with complicated &#8216;swarams' or &#8216;sahityam' for it to become enjoyable and even a simple one can be made beautiful if it sung in the right way with the right &#8216;bhava'. The second piece was a very popular &#8216;Thillana' composed by Balamuralikrishna, the Kadanakuthuhalam thillana in Adi Tala. A lot of stress was laid on cutting the jatis at the right place with the right beat. Maintaining the rhythm and the speed are very important for a &#8216;thillana' to have the desired effect. Even people who have never been exposed to Carnatic music will find it hard not to get sucked into this joyful musical tornado of an experience.The third piece was a much less heard number, &#8216;Krishnayana Baarade' by the saint poet Purandarasa Dr. Balamuralikrishna has set to music, the compositions of many composers as well. This particular piece of Purandaradasa in Raga Kedaram is a piece in Kannada with simple sahityam but with a profound meaning asking people to think of God at every possible instance. This song can have relaxing and calming effect on the singer as well as the listener. The fourth piece was Swathi Thirunal's, &#8216;Jamuna Kinare' in Hindi, tuned by Dr Balamuralikrishna. The fifth song was a folk melody, &#8216;Aemira Rama', composed by Bhadrachala Ramadas. Dr. Balamuralikrishna first heard this song from some peasants working in paddy field in a remote village in Khammam district. Touched by the beauty of their innocence and purity of their heart, he popularised this song through his concerts without any change in tune and rhythm. The workshop concluded with the very soulful melody composed by Sadashiva Brahmedra, &#8216;Samara Vaaram' and set to tune by Dr.Balamurali in Raga &#8216;Bahudari'. It was a treat to the students who were left asking for more when Prince Varma sang the whole song at the end of the session. Rama Varma is indeed the most outstanding teacher a music student can ever dream of.
