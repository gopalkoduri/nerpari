VNAGAMANI SRINATH of Bangalore, a senior and reputed vocalist,  gave her concert for Swarajhari of Vijayawada at the Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram.She started well with `Bantureeti' in `Hamsanadam' but when  she reached the `charanam' the sound system started giving trouble and it persisted till the vocalist got impatient and stopped several times.After the system  was rectified, Nagamani managed to pick up the tempo but this time her voice ceased to cooperate well. However, being an experienced singer, Nagamani finally performed  with deep scholarship and sharp `manodharmam'.After `Bantureeti' Nagamani  rendered Swathi Tirunal's `Mamava Sada Janani'  in `Kanada' and `Srimannarayana' in `Varam' (a `chatusruthi daivatam' version of `Hindola'). For the main item she took up `Latangi' in which she showed mellow artistry and rich `bhava' sense. The `keertana' `Marivere Dikkevvaru' carried intricate `swarakalpana', which reflected the singer's thoroughness in the `laya' aspect.V. Krishnaveni, a staff member of the local Government College of Music and Dance and an able violinist gave excellent support on the violin. At some places she even eclipsed the singer.Krishnaveni's `Latangi' version was particularly impressive. Fine support also came from veteran `mridanga vidushi,' Dandamudi Sumathi Ramamohan Rao.She and Anjaneya Sastri on the `ghatam' together presented a fine rhythmic treat at the close of the main item. Nagamani rendered towards the close of the concert, `Karuniso' a `Purandaradasa' composition in `Subhali', `Nanati Bratuku', an `Annamayya keertana' in `Revathi' and a crisp `thillana' in `Vasanti'.P.
