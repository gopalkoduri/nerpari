VVanam Sankarayya, a verse stage artiste donned the avatar of a Harikatha Bhagavatar, and narrated the wedding story of the celestial couple Padmavati and Srinivasa set in the Harikatha format by renowned poet Peddinti Suryanarayana Deekshitulu. This was presented at Thyagaraya Ganasabha.Dramatised narrationsSankarayya's experience in stage roles that need verse rendition in popular ragas and dramatisation of the characters like &#8216;Bilvamangala' and &#8216;Dharmaraja' stood in good stead in narrating this story in dramatised form. Harikatha proved an easy medium to convey its theme in musical expression and prosaic narration. Harikatha called as &#8216;Samahara Kala', meaning that encompasses all kinds of art forms like drama, dance and music, presented in in humourous form. Vanam Sankarayya proved good at each of these traits. But his dance was restricted only to the movement of his feet in rhythmic format but went well with musical expression in song and verse rendition.The theme was based on the popular &#8216;Sthala Purana' of Tirumala abode of Lord Venkateswara. Sankarayya narrated what made Lord Vishnu descend to earth first in search of Lakshmi, his consort, who had left Vaikuntham, feeling insulted by the way Vishnu pardons Bhrugu Maharshi, even after the sage kicked on the chest of her Lord, irate as his presence was ignored by Vishnu.He is named Srinivasa and finds Padmavati daughter of Akasa Raju in a garden and gets married to her with the monetary support provided by Kubera, Lord of wealth.Vanam Sankariah sang the lyrics in popular ragas, with a compatible diction rendering the thematic content clear and interesting. Though the foot movements were far and few, he could sustain audience interest throughout its narration. Abburi Venkataswamy on harmonium and Ramanamurthy on tabla lent instrumental support.On the occasion the Sankarayya felicitated his gurus Kocherlakota Ramakrishna Bhagavatar and Indirahema Bhagavatarini. Indira appealed to the audience to encourage this art, lest this may disappear one day.C. Narayana Reddi and K.V. Ramana blessed the artiste. This programme was presented under the auspices of Yuvakala Vauhini.
