VShankaramCarnatic Classical - VeenaVeenai JayantiMusic Today C04225Price Rs. 50\u000aJayanti, an accomplished artiste on the veena, is the disciple of Padmavati Ananthgopalan, sister of maestro Lalgudi Jayaraman and the sishya of another stalwart, Veena S. Balachander.After a brief sketch of Kamalamanohari, the kriti on Kanchi Kamakshi by Dikshitar, "Kanchadalayathakshi," and the racy swara prastharas make for a lively beginning.The sober mood of Tyagaraja's "Enthaninne" in Mukhari that speaks of Sabari's Bhagyam is well showcased in Jayanti's interpretation. A rather rare song by Tyagaraja in the  Kannada, "Idhe Bagyamu" is embellished with flawless, sprightly swara passages.The Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi in Simhendramadhyamam is set to Adi Tala. The inlay card mentions that the Ragam and Tanam are composed by Jayanti. Composed, in the context of Ragam and Tanam, is a misnomer. They are not Kalpita Sangeetham but belong to the genre of Kalpana. That the Pallavi format has been composed by Jayanti is correct. The Ragam described in detail highlighting its various hues and the professional display of Tanam in different speeds reveal a focused mind. The Pallavi is imaginatively set and has subtle, rhythmic intricacies that have been handled with care and confidence. Saraswati, Suddhadhanyasi and Sindhubhairavi with swara bedha techniques, are some of the melodies included in the ragamalika chain. The percussive interlude by Bangalore Arjun Kumar (mridangam) and Giridhar Udupa (ghatam) is an impressive tapestry of laya mastery.The album signs off in style with "Sakhi Prana" Dharmapuri Subbarayar's lovely Javali in Chenchurutti.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
