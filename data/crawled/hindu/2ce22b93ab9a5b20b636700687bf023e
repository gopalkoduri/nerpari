VThe Devnandan Ubhayaker Yuva Sangeet Utsav has served as a platform to showcase and nurture young, talented artistes in the field of Hindustani classical music for the last 24 years. This year's festival was a veritable musical bonanza featuring three vocalists and three instrumentalists over three sessions.The first session featured an exquisite vocal recital by Ruchira Kale, formerly a disciple of Alka Deo Marulkar and currently the disciple of Pt. Ulhas Kashalkar and Girija Devi. Ruchira commenced her recital with the popular monsoon melody Raga Miyan ki Malhar, an audav sampoorna raga, pentatonic in its ascent and heptatonic in descent. Her delineation of the vilambit ektaal bandish, a very popular composition by the legendary Sadarang, &#8220;Kareem Nam Tero&#8221; was followed by yet another historic bandish &#8220;Mohammad Shah Rangilari&#8221; in drut teental. Ruchira's exposition of the khyal was characterised by emotional exuberance, extraordinary lyricism and feeling, coupled with richly melodious passages. Ruchira excelled in the impeccable execution of crisp, racy taans especially in the higher octave. Ruchira's rendition of raga Chayanat in the vilambit Jhoomra tal composition &#8220;Sugreeva Ram Krupa&#8221; was a sensitive exploration of the delicate romanticism of this raga. It was followed by a tarana composition that was embellished with a variety of taans. Her exposition of the thumri in Mishra Des &#8220;More Saiyya Bulave&#8221; in adha teental was imbued with a poignancy. Effectively deploying her vocal resources, Ruchira captivated the audience with her passionate rendition of the Marathi Natyageet &#8220;He Surano Chandra Uha&#8221; in raga Charukeshi which was set to rupaktal. Ashwin Walawalkar on the harmonium gave a tremendously inspirational support to the vocalist.Among all the bowed North Indian instruments, it is the sarangi that comes closest to the human voice. The Sangeet Utsav featured an extraordinary sarangi solo recital by Sarwar Hussain, one of the most accomplished musicians of the younger generation of sarangi players in India. Sarwar Hussain moved the audience with the commendable weightiness of his alap in Shree both in the &#8220;anibaddh&#8221; mode and in the vilambit ektal gat composition. His supple &#8220;meends&#8221; were extremely graceful. The drut teental composition in Shree had some scintillating &#8220;vakra&#8221; and &#8220;sapat&#8221; emphasising the artiste's mastery over speed, laya, swara and &#8220;raga bhava&#8221;. Sarwar Hussain mesmerised the audience with an impeccable rendition of a rare raga called Shruthi Vardhini. Bangalore-based tabla artiste Nisar Ahmed who accompanied Sarwar Hussain stole the attention of the audience with his sterling performance. The young, prodigious vocalist Omkarnath Havaldar commenced his recital with Miyan Ki Todi. The grave matrix of Todi came through his alap in a very effective manner. Listening to Omkar's meticulous exposition of this raga was an intense experience. Omkar's serene and meditative alap in the rhythmic avartans of the vilambit khayal incorporated all the salient features of the Merukhand alap style of Kirana ghrana.The progression from alap to bol alap and bol taans in the vilambit khayal was marked by a commendable sense of fluidity, crispness and ease. Omkar's taankari was breathtakingly stupendous. His energetic taans in the chota khayal &#8220;Langari kakari ye&#8221; were reminiscent of his Guru Parampara. Omkar &#8216;s rendition of the chota khayal &#8220;Bhavani Jagat Janani&#8221;, a composition of the legendary Miyan Tansen in the fast paced drut ektal was the piece de resistance of his concert.Hindol Deb's sitar recital opened with the raga Shuddh Sarang, marked by serenity and rich melody. The raga unfolded through an unhurried, evocative alap-jod marked by fascinating improvisations. Hindol Deb successfully touched upon the alluring aspects of this pleasing raga in his alap.His execution of the jhala was marked by the speed and clarity of his taans presenting a striking contrast to the sombre tranquillity of the alap-jod section.The evening's dhrupad recital by Sanchita Chowdhury, a disciple of Ustad Fariduddin Dagar, commenced with an elaborate alap in the chosen raga Bhoop. Sanchita was undaunted by a dogged element of vocal strain and discomfort which had crept into her voice and made a heartening attempt to evoke the grandeur of dhrupad alap. Apurbalal Manna provided excellent saath-sangat on the pakhawaj. Sanchita presented a &#8220;Devi stuti&#8221; in raga Hamsadhawani.It concluded with a sarod recital by the young Arunabha Deb, who chose the popular night raga Bageshree. His lyrical improvisations in the alap-jod-jhala section in the anibaddh mode were followed by a richly, imaginative exposition of the raga in gat compositions in vilambit teental and drut teental.
