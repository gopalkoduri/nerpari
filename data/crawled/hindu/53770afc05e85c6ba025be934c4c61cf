VLALITHAA KRISHNANCarnatica's Hindustani vocal recital featuring Ashwini Bhide Deshpande, found the artiste in excellent form, her voice emerging as a clear stream that flowed in perfect unison with the resonance of the twin tanpuras. The artiste's voice has the ability to take the listener by surprise &#151;  soft in the mandrasaptak,  sturdy, hinting at the steel beneath in the madhyasaptak and ultimately a powerful entity unleashed in the tarasaptak.A bright start with raag Nand included the vilambit and drut khayals set to teen tal.  The halt at the tarasaptak shadja unveiled a potent force, heightened by the listener's realisation that here was power tempered by absolute control. A cluster of taans marked the point where the artiste came into her element, with expert execution.Bhageshri was a thing of beauty, its languid grace filling the senses in the madhya lay composition `Meira Mohan.'  V. Katti (harmonium) and Ravindra Yavagal (tabla) played with and confidence.Sanjeev Abhyankar's vocal concert was distinguished by a neat, polished style characterised by phrases melding to acquire a smooth, seamless quality.Gentle cadencesInitially, the sound system was a source of discomfort to the artiste. However, when the required adjustments were made, his music resumed its flow in the opening notes of raag Shyam Kalyan.The gentle cadences of the commencing suite captured attention with their swaying rhythm. With the gandhar came greater momentum and a wider sweep of phrases &#151;  the inherently upbeat tone of the raag bearing it effortlessly upwards. On the whole, a supple textural quality was aimed for and achieved. Raag Malkauns caressed with its melodic permutations replete with stirring articulation.  A particularly poignant moment was captured at the extended halt at the tarasaptak shadja, a moment so suffused with tenderness that even the spontaneous applause seemed an intrusion. Sensing this, the audience desisted.   Introduced as a `compact piece' in raag Charukesi, `Moraa Man' was a mood-inducing composition. The accompaniment of V.Katti on the harmonium and Vishwanath Mathur on the tabla, were marked by sensitivity.Bottom Template Starts
