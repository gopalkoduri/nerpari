VThe classical music listeners of Varanasi were  regaled recently by three consecutive sarod concerts by eminent performers &#8212; Bhawani Shankar Dasgupta, Narendra Nath Dhar and Tejendra Narayan Majumdar.Kala Prakash organised the first solo performance by Bhawani Shankar Dasgupta. Hailing from Kolkata, son and brilliant disciple of Pandit Buddhadev Dasgupta played the raga with a Maihar Jaijaiwanti on his well-tuned sarod differently. The use of two significant notes Gandhar and Nishad were impeccably lucid in both shuddha and komal variations. After a long time, listeners of Varanasi got an opportunity  to enjoy this raga which seemed to come out from within the mind of the sarod. Bhawani Shankar&#8217;s finger work  was intelligent and dynamic. He completed this mesmerising concert, held in the open-air premises of Raman Niwas, with a few rare compositions created by Pandit Radhika Mohan Maitra and Ustad Amir Hussain Khan Saheb.  Among these compositions, raga Zila-Kafi flowered beautifully to Subrato Roy Chowdhury&#8217;s tabla.  The other two sarod recitals were held at Sankatmochan Sangit Samaroh.  The learned disciple of Pandit Radhika Mohan Maitra, Pandit Narendra Nath Dhar from Lucknow, impressed  with his profound Chandrakauns. Most sarod players use the important notes of the raga to fulfil and maintain the required character  of this night raga.  In the highly emotive playing of Pandit Dhar, however, one or two essential notes predominate, bringing out the inner pathos of the raga and touching the listener&#8217;s heart. Like the sensitive role of the note Shuddha Nishad, by which one can initiate the soul of this raga.  In Dhar&#8217;s playing, the use of this particular note is  like a celebration in the pathos of the night.  The notes of Dhar&#8217;s sarod never seem in a hurry. They take time to express themselves, for, as he says, &#8220;Every note has something to say of its own. It wants to tell its  story full of emotion  like a catharsis for the heart of the listener.&#8221;He has been a disciple of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan but his soft strokes  are reminiscent of the graceful  tones of Pandit Nikhil Chakrabarty. So the Khamaj or Bageshri  played by Dhar  seems has if imbued with the spirit of Nikhil Babu. Tabla accompaniment by Sudhir Pandey was not dignified  enough.Tejendra Narayan Majumdar with his amazing sarod was the third concert that the listeners were treated to. He learnt the basic nuances of sarod from Bahadur Khan Saheb and later from Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. Pandit Tejendra  began playing his sarod in the midst of midnight and early morning with raga Kaunsi Kanhada.With the help of Komal Nishad and Komal Gandhar, he offered  a glorious alap and completed the other part, the drut portion of this concert, with another raga, Chandranandan, a new raga created by his guru Ali Akbar Khan.   Kumar Bose  accompanied him congruently on the tabla.
