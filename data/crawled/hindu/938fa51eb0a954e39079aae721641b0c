VThe 24th National Convention of the &#8216;Society for Promoting Indian Classical Music &amp; Culture Amongst Youth&#8217; (SPIC-MACAY) held in Kerala recently concluded with a robust vocal recital by the formidable 102-year-old Ustad Abdul Rashid Khan from Kolkata. The recital left the student delegates from across the country  as well as the invited audience of Thiruvananthapuram  awestruck.Ustad Abdul Rashid was the last artist performing at the overnight concert on the concluding evening of the weeklong convention . He chose early morning ragas for his recital opening with an &#8216;achhobh&#8217; (uncommon) raga Lalit-Kauns. The twin  madhyams of the early morning Lalit were dealt deftly with the intriguing Kauns-ang throughout the portrayal of this rare raga in a consistent manner. He also sang a couple of variants of Bhairav like the Nat-Bhairav before  concluding with his self-composed Bhairavi bhajan.The  Ustad&#8217;s sturdy voice and its amazing reach from mandra  shadja to  taar-pancham, the clarity of his well-rendered &#8216;taiyaar&#8217;  taans and his command over the melodic and the rhythmic virtuosity was awesome.The last surviving exponent of the Khandhaar Bani Dhrupad and  the legendary rudra-veena player of Jaipur Beenkaar gharana, Ustad Asad Ali Khan chose the challenging midnight raga Darbari Kanada and played the detailed  alaap-jod followed by a Dhrupad composition set to Chautala with much restraint focusing on the subtle nuances like the  ati  komal  gandhaar and the specific &#8216;aandol&#8217;  dhaivat of this majestic raga which demands the deep knowledge of not only the swaras but the underlying shades of the concerned  shrutis (the microtones) as well. The composition had its focal point, the &#8216;sam&#8217; itself on the aandolit ati- komal gaandhaar, which needed an Asad Ali Khan to handle it properly. He also obliged when requested to play more with a faster composition in raga Sohani set to teevra tala. Dal Chand Sharma, the jewel of Nathdwara  gharana, gave him the percussion support .The eminent Carnatic vocalist T.V. Shankarnarayanan was the other attraction at the overnight concert. Being a disciple of the famous Madurai Mani Ayyar, TVS has got the vibrancy of the Mani Ayyar bani which was evident throughout his concert from the opening natakurinji varnam of Swathi Thirunal to the Thyagaraja kriti in Hindolam, Papanasham  Shivan&#8217;s composition in Hamsanandi and the concluding Jaunpuri.Another artiste who performed was the young flutist Ronu Majumdar who played raga Ahir Bhairav followed by a melodious &#8216;Vaishnav Jan&#8230;&#8217; like a thumri  in raga Khamaj. The overnight concert had taken a flying start with the captivating Kathak performance of Pandit Birju Maharaj and Shasvati Sen.The national convention  was dedicated to the late Guru Ammannur Madhava Chakyar.
