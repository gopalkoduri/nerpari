VThe concert opened with Telemann&#8217;s Trio for recorder, cello, and piano. The recorder&#8217;s pure sound resonated beautifully in the auditorium and set the measured tone for the rest of performance.The young pianist Anand Seshadri gave a pleasant and sensitive rendition of Chopin&#8217;s Polonaise in C sharp minor, if a little under-performed. It was a shame that the piano was not wheeled around a little because he was left with no other option than to play with his back to half the audience.Both the Johann Joachim Quantz Sonata in D and the Haydn Trio were Prabhu George(violin), George Samuel (violin and viola) and Francis Rozario (cello). This clearly experienced trio had good timing and were well able to pass the melody back and forth where required. But how they communicated remained a mystery &#8212; one can only assume that they were so used to playing with each other they did not feel the need to look at each other.But it was the guitars that everyone was waiting for &#8212; the audience shifted in their seats and cameras flashed as Thangadurai Samuel and Roman Peter took their seats for the Francisco Carulli Serenade. The difficult fingerwork employed in the piece appeared natural so that all the rhythm and flavour of Spain were brought rollicking into the South Indian space. In the confidently executed Martinis Plaisir damour that followed, the old lady behind me swayed, humming along - and nobody seemed to mind.Despite the impromptu (and unannounced) changes in programme the variations could be easily made out by the tell-tale motifs Vivaldi employed in his composition. Vivaldi&#8217;s Concerto in D, a highly technical work with a complex rhythm, was adroitly performed by Thangadurai Samuel, who succeeded in making a single guitar as expressive as any violin duet. If you closed your eyes it was easy to mistake the sound for that of the lute (the predecessor of the modern classical guitar) and imagine yourself in the princely palaces of Vivaldi&#8217;s seventeenth century Europe.Vivaldi&#8217;s Concerto for three guitars, in which Peter and Samuel were joined by G. Karthik, was met with catcalls of approval. Schubert&#8217;s Quartet for guitar, flute, viola and cello contained some very nice phrasing from S. Balakrishnan and the final Andreaccio, performed by the full ensemble was imbued with energy the audience needed on a Sunday night.The encouraging number of young people in the audience would have put the largely grey-haired audiences of today&#8217;s Europe to shame. This was indeed the object of the whole exercise &#8212; to encourage young people to listen, understand and hopefully pick up a classical instrument.In India, there is a growing interest in Western music. We want to encourage the children to learn classical music. The most important thing for a child is to listen, he said. Only after this will he or she feel the music and begin to understand it.As the audience evaporated into the monsoon-cooled dusk, I was left wondering why this sort of concert doesn&#8217;t happen at Museum Theatre more often.
