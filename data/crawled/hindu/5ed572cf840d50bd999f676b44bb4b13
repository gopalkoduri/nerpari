VT.H. SUBRAMANIAM IS counted among the top Carnatic violinists of Kerala. When two percussionists of national repute K.V. Prasad and Thripunithura Radhakrishnan, who like Subramaniam are from Ernakulam, joined hands to support Subramaniam in a concert at Kerala Fine Arts Society, recently, a large crowd gathered and it was not entirely disappointed.`Neranammi,' adathala varnam in Kanada raga, made for a smooth start. `Sree Mahaganapathiravathumam' in Gowla raga, with its supplegamakasin the low octave, was charming. A sparse alapana of Lathangi and then came the crisp kriti in khanda chapu `Mariveredikkevaru.' `Kanchadalayatakshi' in Kamalamanohari was succeeded by a fervent delineation of `Malayamarutham.' `Manasayatulo' was not free from rhythmic discrepancies. This happened frequently during the concert.`Sarasasamadana bheda danda chathura,' another Thyagaraja kriti in Kapi Narayani, followed. An exposition of `Hamir Kalyani' triggered wistful emotions. The violinist played skilfully to create magic. In a two `kalai' speed came the Thyagaraja kriti `Manamuleda.' This piece compensated for all the lapses that took place during the concert.The thaniyavarthanam by Prasad on the mridangam, Radhakrishnan on the ghatam and Payyannur Shivaprasad on the morsing rose to the desired levels. `Ramachandra prabhu' in Sindhubhairavi and `Alarsaraparithapam' in Surutti were the concluding pieces.HAREESH BALBottom Template Starts
