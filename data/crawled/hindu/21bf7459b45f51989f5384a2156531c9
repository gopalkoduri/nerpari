'), he sang `Enta ninnu vedi tine... ' in raga `Chandrahasita,' a creation of GNB. The raga was framed after shedding the panchama swara in Harikamboji raga, explained the singer.Similarly, `Sudha madhurya bhashini... ,' a fast-paced kriti in Vandanadharini was yet another innovation of GNB. The raga had been created by pruning the nishadham of Saraswathi raga.`Bhuvanatraya Sammohana kara... ' is a GNB kriti extolling Sabarimala Sasta. Ayamkudi Mani presented the piece after an elegant elaboration of Mohanam.Main piece`Nee samana mevaru leranu' ( Subha panthuvarali) in Adi tala was the main piece.The other numbers sung were `Barama ee baluni brova... ' (Hamsanadham), `Samagana lole... ' (Hindolam), `Sandatamunine koritini... ' (Valachi), `Sarasijakhini sada palaya' ( Margahindolam) and a Tillana in Margahindolam.The singer was accompanied by M.N.
