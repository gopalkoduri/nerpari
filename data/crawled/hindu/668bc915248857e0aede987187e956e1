VV. Sitaramaiah , a customs officer by profession, is an ardent devotee of music. He took to playing keyboard almost three decades ago . Today he mastered both the instrument and the music he plays on it. Recently he presented his knowledge and skill before an august audience who included Carnatic musician and scholar Dr. Nookala Chinna Satyanarayana and others. Ghantasala Sangeetha Sabha organised this event last week at Thyagaraya Gana Sabha. Inaugurating the show Nookala said that instruments like keyboard and harmonium could never commit mistake in playing notations. But trouble arose in playinggamakas. Sitaramaiah, he said was capable of mending his play to meet the same. Sitaramaiah played both Carnatic and Hindustani compositions and then followed with the best of film  hits with classical flavour. He began withPahadi Dhuncomposed by sitar maestro Abdul Haleem Zafar Khan. Then he playedYamanwith a briefAlapwithgatinTeen Taal, Madhya layaand later in breezydruttempo. Then he switched over to Carnatic Style. He played  aMohana varnamfollowed byHindolampiece-Samajavaragamana.While playing the briefragaandkritihe resorted to virtuosi spells on the keyboard that put to view his command on technique. Nazamuddin Javed on tabla and Jayakumaracharya on mridangam lent support in the classical parts.The last part of the programme was Sitaramaiah's handling of the most popular and immortal songs of Indian cinema, especially Telugu and Hindi. He played Ghantasala songs in plenty - all masterpieces. Nedunuri Syamakrishna lent voice. His was an orchestra, not just an instrument, as it produces a number of musical combinations. He displayed his wizardry on the instrument.G.S.Bottom Template Starts
