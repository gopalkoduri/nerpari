VSringaramComposer: Swati TirunalSinger: Sreevalsan J. MenonManorama MusicCost: Rs. 100Does ethnic  flavour have a decisive influence in the diction each vocalist creates? One is tempted to say &#8216;yes&#8217; when one listens to kriti renditions of the great names in Carnatic classical music. M.D. Ramanathan, K.V. Narayana Swamy and Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagawathar carried a tenor in their music that was easily recognised by their colleagues and  rasikas as the Palakkad baani.In the succeeding generation, Neyyattinkara Vasudevan shaped  a captivating idiom, which he comfortably passed on to his disciples. Sreevalsan J. Menon is perhaps the only one among them who sustains the full rigour of renditions, which his guru adhered to. This becomes clear  in the CD &#8216;Sringaram,&#8217; a collection of select lyrics from  Swati Tirunal&#8217;s compositions.Sreevalsan begins with the line &#8216;Jalajabandhu&#8217; in raga Surutti, in the  popular padam &#8216;Alarsara parithapam.&#8217;  Surutti and the alluring grace of mishrachappu tala  are capable of transporting the listener to the imaginary presence of a Mohiniyattam dancer. The underlying shade of a  Nayika&#8217;s pathos, communicated in the padam to the Sakhi, is steadily built up in the kritis that follow.&#8216;Kanthanodu chennu&#8217; is again an eminent padam through which  Mohiniyattam dancers convey  the pangs of separation of the Nayika.  Neelambari, the raga in which it is sung, is in perfect harmony with the sahitya, the meaning of which Sreevalsan effortlessly brings out. His humming in between the lines is bhava-evocative.&#8216;Hanta Njan Innu,&#8217; the next in the series, is a rarely heard composition of Swati. Set to Panthuvarali raga and Adi tala, Sreevalsan does a weighty rendition resembling a Kathakali padam. The jeevaswaras of the raga find eloquent expression in the way he employs the gamakas.Raga Navaroj in Carnatic music is equivalent to  raga Navarasa found in Attakkathas. &#8216;Dhanyayai Njan&#8217; evokes a serene mood in the minds of the listeners. &#8216;Mullappoo malaramban,&#8217; a padam in raga Sahana, that succeeds is a rarely heard Swati kriti.  The nuances of the raga complement the lyrical expression.The next two short padams, &#8216;Kamini mani&#8217; and &#8216;Sumukhi nin,&#8217; are in ragas Poorva Kamodari and Saindhavi respectively. Apart from the novelty of introducing these ragas, there is not much to be relished in these padams.While the javali in raga Behag that follows is a pleasant tonal deviation from the previous renditions, the finale, &#8216;Basurangi Bale,&#8217; in raga Saveri set to Mishra chappu is emotionally vibrant.Sreevalsan and  violinist Edappally Ajith Kumar have paid meticulous attention to the orchestration. Ajith&#8217;s violin and Balakrishna Kammath&#8217;s mridangam seldom dominate the climate of sringara sustained all through the CD.Kalamandalam Balaraman&#8217;s chenda and Raj Narayanan&#8217;s maddalam are interspersed in such a way that they augment the overall impact of the padams. Thripunithura Krishna Das, a  gifted edakka player, does not have much to do although the melody of his instrument moves the listeners even by the single strokes that appear once in a while.K. X. Wilson&#8217;s keyboard and Kalamandalam Manoj Kumar&#8217;s elathalam  support the musical  ambience. The gamaka-laden voice of Sreevalsan is a pleasure to listen to.
