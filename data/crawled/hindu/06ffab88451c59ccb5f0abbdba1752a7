VTHE MANDOLIN recital of  U. Srinivas and U. Rajesh, who have grown into instrumental wizards with maturity over years of practice, created sound explosives sans lyrical tenderness in the inaugural concert of the 10th Pongal Music festival featured by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Coimbatore Kendra.The concert which began  with Viribhoni varnam in Bhairavi in vilamba and durita kalams was soft and juicy followed by a brief alapana of Hamsadhwani for the song, "Mooladhara Moorthe" rendered with swara gimmicry."Raga Sudharasa (Aandholika ) and "Sree Rama Pada" (Amrithavahini ) were in tasteful style of instrumental artistry.The following pieces, "Ninnuvina" in Navarasa kannada and "Manavyala" (Nalinakanti) were lively with rhythmic details. The detailed essay of Kalyani for Pankajalochana was an attractive rendition.But their production of high sound following the alapana of Karaharapriya for "Chakkaniraja" especially in the neraval and swaras marked by discords in several places made carnatic music feel its isolation from its melodic moorings.The percussion artistes, Ramakrishnan on the mridangam and Guru prasad on the ghatam, who joined the decibel needs no comment. Their combined play threw all lyrical softness to the winds.The only serene moments were when "Jagadoddharana" (Kapi ) and "Kaatrinile varum geetham" were played by the duo.S. D. Sridhar gave agreeable support on the violin.As is the practice of the Coimbatore Kendra of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan to honour eminent composers and musicians with the title of Sangeth Samrat, Thanjavur Sankara Iyer was conferred the birudhu in recognition of his invaluable contributions to the exposition of theory and nuances of music by B. K. Krishnaraja Vanavarayar, Chairman of BVB this year. Krishnakumar   read the citation.T. K. GANAPATHYBottom Template Starts
