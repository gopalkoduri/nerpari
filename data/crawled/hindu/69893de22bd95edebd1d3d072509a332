VAlmost all the pieces that Sudha Ragunathan chose for the Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer Centenary Celebration concert were the doyen&#8217;s all-time favourites. This included the Viriboni varnam (Bhairavi, Ata talam) with which she began the concert.&#8220;Siddhi Vinayakam,&#8221; a Dikshitar kriti (Chamaram, Rupakam) was next in order preceded by a slokam. Kalpanaswaram in &#8220;Prasidha Gananayakam&#8221; warmed up Sudha&#8217;s voice.Neatly sequenced niraval and kalpanaswara phrases adorned  &#8220;Dinamani Vamsa&#8221; (Harikhambodi, Adi, Tyagaraja) underlining the singer&#8217;s vast experience as a concert artist.Again it was experience coupled with open throated singing that helped Sudha overcome the problems posed by a sore throat. Clear diction that brought out the beauty of the sahitya made amends for the handicap.The Sriranjani alapana for the Dikshitar piece, &#8220;Sri Ramachandro Rakshatu&#8221; (Vasantha, Misrachapu) was structured well. Swarams and niraval for the line, &#8220;Sita Kalyana Mahotsavam&#8221; was done with precision.The main piece was &#8220;Swararaaga Sudha&#8221; (Sankarabaranam, Adi, Tyagaraja). . The bad throat  did not stop Sudha from attempting octave &#8216;jumps&#8217; or Tharasthayi prayogas because of the right kind of voice production.The other pieces Sudha chose that evening were popular Dasar Padam, Bhavayami (Ragamalika, Rupakam, Swati Tirunal), &#8220;Innudaya Barade&#8221; (Kalyanavasantam, Kandachapu, Purandaradasa) and Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s Thillana (Behag, Adi).Neyveli Skanda Subramaniam was a great support with his  sensitive playing. His precise and appropriate cadences and anticipatory phrases were exemplary.R. Raman played on the morsing. M.R. Gopinath gave adequate support on the violin.
