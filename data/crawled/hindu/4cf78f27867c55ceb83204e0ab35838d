VPleasing tonality on the special violin with contact mike was the highlight of the violin solo by Dr. Nandini. The electronically adapted sound had the resonance of a mandolin or a shehnai. Nandini chose melody over complexity in fashioning a concert filled with Adi tala, uniform tempo, compositions.Soothing rendition&#8216;Gajavadana Beduve' (Hamsadhwani, Purandaradasa) started the metronome which continued into &#8216;Ekambresa Nayike' (Karnataka Sudha Saveri) with routine swarams. Ramapriya (Mathangi, Dikshitar) with good raga bhavam added melody. Nandini's Syama ragam was soothing as the twin-bowing effect supported the raga contours nicely.The kriti, &#8220;Santhamulekha&#8221; of Tyagaraja, continued the concert pace. One felt Nandini could have changed the tempo track in this song to break the monotony. &#8216;Bantureethi' (Hamsanadham) preceded the majestic &#8216;Maa Janaki' (Khambodi, Tyagaraja). While the raga essay was too brief to make an impression, the kriti handling was good.The song has a slightly brisk kalapramana and Nandini's response to the composer's imagination was perfect. Brief niraval (&#8220;Vani matalaku&#8221;) and simple swarams did not embellish the song much.The percussionists Bangalore Ramnath and N. Narasimhan did not really make a serious effort to excel as the concert mood underlined moderation.
