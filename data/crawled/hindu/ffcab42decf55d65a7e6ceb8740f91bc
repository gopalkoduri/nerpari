VBlessed with a resonant saareeram, the abundant creative energy of V. Sankaranarayanan evidenced through subtle and flashy expressions at the Manoranjitham festival of music at Sree Ayyappan Puja Sangham, Ramnagar, Coimbatore, took on a breezy complexion on the opening day.After a warm up with an animated version of the Lalgudi varnam, &#8216;Vanajakshi,' in Ata tala, followed by &#8216;Vatapi Ganapatim' (Hamsadhwani) with niraval and swaras, the Purvikalyani raga vinyasam for the kriti, &#8216;Gnanamosagaradha' was spontaneous with a plethora of sancharas and long korvais. His Thodi delineation was developed with assurance and assertive sangatis for the kriti, &#8216;Ninnenamminanu.'Balasubramaniam's accompaniment on the violin revealed his class in the richness of sancharas in the raga versions and swara repartees.Prakash (mridangam) and Subramaniam (ganjira) accompanied the recital with deft fingers in the laya wing.Decorous presentationSudha Ragunathan's decorous presentation of kritis on the second day commenced with a Lalgudi varnam in Nalinakanti.&#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam' in Shanmukhapriya with swaras and &#8216;Saarasadalanayana' in Khamaas were sublime. Her alapanas of Purvikalyani for the kriti, &#8216;Anandanatamaduvar Thillai' and Kiravani for the kriti, &#8216;Kalikiyunte' were strained and the customary verve and vivacity were missing in the recital.Gopinath's violin accompaniment was exuberant. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and Raman (morsing) proved their mettle in their laya exercise.Finesse missingThough age has not withered their musical impulses, the performance of the Bombay Sisters, C. Saroja and C. Lalitha, fell short of finesse very essential to bring out sukham in music. They sang &#8216;Jaya Jaya' in Nattai with chittaswarams followed by &#8216;Brochevarevarura' (Khamas).Lalitha's alapana of Purvikalyani for &#8216;Gnanamosagaradha' and Saroja's raga delineation of Khambodi for the kriti &#8216;Aalokaye Rukmani,' though stressed the essential moorchanas, their exercise to modulate their communication skills with subtlety of control failed to bring about an aesthetic twist and melody to the ragas and the compositions.&#8216;Kanchadalayadakshi' (Kamalamanohari) and &#8216;Ganamurthe' were wholesome presentations.Srikanth's solo versions of the ragas on the violin were executed with &#233;lan. Madipakkam Suresh (mridangam) and Madipakkam Murali (ghatam) provided able support with tidy strokes all through.Unusual combinationMelody took a back seat in the strange and unusual combination of Balasai on the flute and U.P. Raju on the mandolin to the accompaniment of Harikumar on the mridangam and Murali on the ghatam.There was neither sruti nor coordination between the instruments.Their renditions lacked aesthetics. Flagging off the kutcheri with Navaragamalika varnam, &#8216;Gajananayutham' (Chakravaaham), that followed, was pleasing. The blast on the mridangam during the swara exercise for the kriti, &#8216;Marivere' did not enable the rasikas to appreciate the rendition.The other numbers &#8216;Paryachakama' (Vanaspati), &#8216;Padumanabhan Maruga' (Nagaswarali) and a Lalgudi tillana formed their musical agenda. The loud beats of the percussionists once again played spoil sport.The organisers will do well to commence the concerts in time without a laborious introduction trying the patience of the rasikas.
