VIt is unfortunate if an artiste imagines that a soprano voice is equal to open-throated singing that can help audience appreciate the music. Inflated voice articulation inhibits the listener from experiencing aesthetic finesse in a full-fledged recital.The slapdash package of expressions in the musical wares displayed by Abhishek Raghuram on the opening day of the 12th  Pongal festival at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan pushed to the background, loftiness of expression, and the concert was a tame affair. His opening presentation of the `Ninnukkori' varnam gave a lilting start.Decked with swarasIn the next item, Tyagaraja's `Rama Neepai' in Kedaram decked with swaras, Abhishek could not capture the spirit of the song adequately.His raga delineation of Vasanthabhairavi for the item `Needayaradha' was more demonstrative than lyrical.`Raghuveera Ranadeera' in Huseni and `Naan Oru Vilayattu Bommaiya' (Navarasakannada) moved with confidence.The Kalyani alapana for the kriti, `Nidhichala Sukhama' traversed a good range dwelling on the mandhara prayogas with vibrancy. A ragamalika and other tukkadas were rendered routinely.Sriram Parasuram's violin accompaniment was melodic in his essay of the ragas, Vasanthabhairavi, Kalyani, Reetigowlai and swara repartees.The delightful percussive activism of Palghat Raghu on the mridangam and Gopalakrishnan on the kanjira gave support to the vocalist.T.K.GANAPATHYBottom Template Starts
