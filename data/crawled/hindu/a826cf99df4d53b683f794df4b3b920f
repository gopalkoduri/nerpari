VWhen expertise meets its equal in a corresponding arena, then it has to be excellence all through. Santoorist Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya and Romu Majumdar, the avante-guard flautist regaled the audience with theirjugalbandirecentl\u000ay. Ramkumar Mishra on the tabla was stupendous. Whateverraagthey chose to present, it was sheer ecstasy in resonance. The Ravindra Bharati auditorium reverberated with the melodic notes emanating from the santoor and the bansuri in t\u000aurns or in merged harmony. It was difficult to decide who was excelling whom, as Pandit Romu ambled through the intrinsicraagsdelineating one after the other in his inimitable style and posing thesawaalto Pandit \u000aTarun who dexterously answered through his melodious santoor. Thesawaal-jawabhad the third angle in the tabla whose beat was able to the create the illusion ofbhol. The cascading effect of the notes, as they showe\u000ared from ascending to descending order syllable after syllable, was marvellous. Tarun was like a wizard with his instrument as he strummed forth long-winding utterances with astounding adroitness. It was a play of wits for sometime with Romu taking up hisshank bansuri(conch-sounding flute) and recreating the rhythmic noise of the ocean in its various moods. The sonorous shank bansuri had the exact resonance of the conch especially as he touched the base octave and rose slowly but st\u000aeadily to the middle and upper octaves in symmetrical fashion till he reached a crescendo wherein the santoorist chipped in like an echo to the entire exercise. The shrill tones reaching a plateau and holding there was like a marvel. Meticulous as it seemed, the santoor seemed endowed with a kiss of life in Tarun&#8217;s expert handling.Percussion to perfection- that was Ramkumar Mishra. He was an active co-player rather than a support artiste throughout. The tabla acquired a third dimension in thejugalbandiwhich served to enhance the recital.Kudos to the Alpha Foundation, sponsored by the ICFAI for coming out with some of the finest musical nights as a part of its regular cultural fiesta for the benefit of the underprivileged. It&#8217;s indeed a noble gesture both to the cause of music and mankind.
