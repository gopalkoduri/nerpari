VJITENDRA PRATAPIt was a good two-hour sitar recital by the Kolkata-based Deb Prasad Chakravorty a disciple of the late Ajoy Sinha Roy, who in turn had received guidance from the late Baba Alauddin Khan and his younger brother Ayet Ali Khan.Deb Prasad commenced his recital of the evening with the dusk-time raga Puriya Dhanashri, which was certainly a most apt choice. The at-length alap, jod and jhala was an in-depth rendering and covered the entire gambit of the sitar encompassing all the three-and-a-half octaves. His handling of the bass strings was indeed neat and bold. One however wished his treatment of the raga had been with the requiredvakra, or criss-cross movement of its notes, and not too straight as the case was. The mid-tempo composition set to an 11-beat time cycle was redolent with scores of well executed variations.A brief alap in the season's raga Mian-ki-Malhar was followed by the slow 16-beat Masitkhani gat-toda and concluded with a fast Teen tala composition and a scintillating jhala sequence. The slow and fast Teen tala gat-todas in raga Piloo were laced with many a colourful innovation.The artiste concluded with the slow and fast Teen tala compositions in raga Hemant with a simmering Madhyam note. Incidentally, the raga Hemant and its compositions are the well known creations of the late Ustad Alauddin Khan of Maiher, universally known as Baba Alauddin. One wished the artiste had not taken the liberty of distorting the fast tempo composition's format that ought to have commenced from the first beat of the fast tempo 16-beat time cycle.The tabla accompaniment by Malab Das Gupta was indeed highly competent, besides the scintillating rounds of his solo variations with neat and rich-toned handling of the drums.Bottom Template Starts
