VSANKAR NA vocal concert by Kottakal Renjith Warrier, organised under the auspices of Sadguru Sangeeta Sabha, Kozhikode, proved that the grand tradition of classical music in Kerala has not lost its roots. Renjith, initially trained in vocal music by Mangad Natesan, is now a student of Mavelikkara Prabhakara Varma.The concert began with the Ata thala Bhairavi varnam of Pachimiriyam Adiyappaya, `Viriboni.' It was followed by `Sobillu Saptaswara' of Thyagaraja, composed in Jaganmohini and set to Rupaka thalam. The audience were transported to heights of musical bliss when he sang `Dinamani Vamsa' in Harikambhoji, a grand Thyagaraja kriti in Chowka Kaalam.The song was well traced and the elaborateswara alaapana, with manytharasthayi sancharas, gave ample opportunities for the accompanists to showcase their skills. This was followed by an elaborate Saveri alapana, which highlighted the vocalist's ability to sing abhava-laden music. The kriti sung was `Durusuga Kripajuchi Santhatha' of Syama Sastri. The vocalist's perfect vocabulary and the profound involvement in the song conveyed the real mood of the song in which Syama Sastri prays to Bangaru Kamakshi to bless him and free him from all maladies.The next kriti was `Korinavaramu' of Thyagaraja composed in Ramapriya. The kriti rendition and theswaralapanawere in fact more melodious than theragalapana.`Shree Sathyanarayanam,' a kriti in Subhapantuvarali that is devoted to Lord Vishnu at Badrinath, was a treat for Dikshitar fans. Then came up a brisk rendition of `Sanathana' of Thyagaraja in Phalamanjari; a rare raga that is similar to Kanada.The choice of the evening was Kamboji.  And the kriti was `Evari Mata' of Thyagaraja. Theneravalat `Bhaktha paradhi' and theswarakalpana, were well sung, without any spontaneous innovations. Thekalaparamanamof the song was so compatible that the mridangist ventured to play a beautiful khanda nadai during the thanivarthanam.Throughout the concert, one could witness the versatility of Renjith Warrier, who is also an accomplished Kathakali padam singer and a Chakiyar Koothu artiste.  His ability to establish a good rapport with the accompanying artistes made the concert a delight forrasikas.Bottom Template Starts
