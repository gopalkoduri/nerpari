VG. JAYAKUMARClassical music buffs spent a delightful evening listening to a Carnatic music recital by K.R. Saranathan at the Karthika Tirunal Theatre in Thiruvananthapuram. It was organised by the Sri Swati Sangeeta Sabha as part of their monthly programme.Saranathan who hails from Tamil Nadu is the disciple of Sethurama Iyer and belongs to the Madurai Mani Iyer School. He is the Asthanavidwan at Kanchi Mutt, and a faculty member of the Department of Fine Arts, Annamalai University.Saranathan began his concert with a varnam in Bhairavi- `Viriboni ninne kori,' a composition of Pachimiriyum Adiyappa Iyer set to Adathalam, and followed it up with Muthuswami Deekshitar's `Vatapi ganapathim bhajehum' in Hamsadwani.Compelling performanceA Navagraha keertan in Asaveri followed next  -   `Chandram bhaja manasam' of Deekshitar set to Maddya thalam is considered an auspicious raga rendered on Mondays.Next was Swati Tirunal's `Sarasaksha paripalaya' in Pantuvarali (which Deekshitar called Kamavardhini raga).This was followed by ragamalika `Sankara bharana devi' a favourite of the late Madurai Somu. It included ragas such as Sakarabharanam, Shanmughapriya, Gowrimanohari, Syamabhuvana Gandhari, Jyothiswaroopini, Bhairavi, Sarangam, Vijayanagari, Madhyamavathu, Manolaya, Mohanam and Keeravni.Then, a keertan  -   `Vande vasudevam' of Annamacharia in Sree Ragam followed.Again a Swati composition in Nattakurinji  -   `Manavasadha varada' set to Roopaka thalam.After which, Saranathan gave an elaborate exposition of `Sabhapsthiye ninne maname,' `Sadananda nadanam,' in Kalyani set to Adithalam thishranada. It was follows by a good Thaniavarthanam.The thukkadas at the end were `Vaa vadivelane vaa,' a piece of Maharajapuram Santhanam in Sreeranjini, Muthiah Bhagavathar's composition with Western notes in Sankarabharanam scale - Ga Ma Ga Ri Ga Pa Ri Ga Sa, `Yeppavaruvalo aaro,' `Ullu mathara kanayale,' and `Mangalam.' Throughout the concert, Saranathan displayed his powerfulshareeram, in both thealapanaand kriti rendition. This reflects the tremendoussadhanahe puts in.Hisbrigas,sangathisand briskswaraprastharawith the unique permutations were well received. The fastkalapramanamset by Saranathan for the compositions made manysangathisspirited and colourful.The vocalist kept gesturing encouragingly at the accompanying artists. S.R. Rajesree on the violin and Nanchil Arul on the mridangom rose to the occasion and delighted the audience. However, there was no ghattam, which would have improved the rendering of the thaniavarthanam. On the whole, the selection of the ragas was in keeping with the occasion and there was no contrast felt.Bottom Template Starts
