VCan  R. Vedavalli&#8217;s exclusive presentation of Ambujam Krishna&#8217;s kritis at the Music Academy be termed  a cutcheri? Perhaps based on its format it was. But actually it was something more than that.  Ambujam Krishna&#8217;s  lyrics possess \u000a a great sense of music and her  songs have been received well by artists and rasikas. But those who  attended the programme of Vedavalli with  special interest in  the libretto could not have missed the admirable  aspects of the compositions.  The songs have been written in simple Tamil with rhythmic meter, poetic fragrance and above all devotion and total submission to the Almighty. The lines are in praise of the benevolence of the chosen deity, the power of bakthi and  the noble demands of a spiritual mind.On the  occasion, Vedavalli did  yet another  service to classical music by setting  Ambujam Chithi&#8217;s (as fondly referred by Vedavalli) less known kritis to music to suit the mood and contents of the lyrics.Among the 14  songs rendered some stirred the emotions strongly. &#8216;Uruga Vendamo&#8217; was a moving number in Keeravani, where the songster  emphasises on the importance of bhakti. The Kalyani kriti, &#8216;Thaye Dhayai Purivaai&#8217; expressed the absolute surrender of a devotee.  In the central piece, &#8216;Arul Ondre Podhum Endru,&#8217;  Ambujam Krishna  lists the great attributes needed for noble character, with a beautiful choice of words.  She  crowns it with  a line  meaning, &#8216;What more does one require other than His lotus feet that scaled the  sky and earth!&#8217;  Vedavalli handled this composition in Shanmugapriya with an alapana, niraval at &#8216;Naranan Paripooranan,&#8217; and an engaging swara suite. Except the  Telugu (Ramapriya) piece, &#8216;Nilasiyannanu Rama,&#8217; all  were in Tamil.The other songs set  to tune by Vedavalli,  were,  &#8216;Varamithondre Podumae&#8217; (Sama), &#8216;Odumino Odumino&#8217; (Anandhabhairavi), &#8216;Yaro Eduthu Solvar&#8217; (Todi), &#8216;Kurai Yedu Ini Kuvalayathil&#8217; (Natakurunji), &#8216;Perinbam Enakkarulvai&#8217; (Atana), &#8216;Anjal Endroru Sol&#8217; (Mhanam) and &#8216;Tarunam Parka Thaguma&#8217; (Abhogi). The final numbers &#8216;Konjum Silamboliyum&#8217; in Bageshri and &#8216;Va Va Brindavanathuraiyum Siruva&#8217; in Sindhubhairavi carried fine lilt.  Those who wish to  include the compositions of Ambujam Krishna in their repertoire should make a beeline for Vedavalli&#8217;s school.R.K. Sriram Kumar is a versatile violinist; his  intense vibrancy impresses both the youth and  a  disciplinarian like Vedavalli.  It did here. Patri Sathish Kumar&#8217;s tani made an impact.
