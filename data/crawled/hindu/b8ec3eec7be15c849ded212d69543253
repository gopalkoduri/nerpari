VThe clear tonal quality of M.S. Sheela's voice makes every note audible. Making the best use of it, Sheela maintained her sancharas in all the scales. The upper scale notes did not have a single streak of false tone.Right from the varnam in Durbar, Sheela was determined to carry on the concert with variety and vigour. &#8216;Sri Sankara Guruvaram' in Nagaswarali composed by Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan was a display of speed with precision. She sang kalpana swaras in all the three octaves with a free flow of creativity.Tyagaraja's kriti, &#8216;Sriramaya Chitta' in Jayamanohari is another rare item heard in concerts these days. With no trace of Abhogi or Sriranjani, her singing the swaras with definite phrases was remarkable. H.S. Sudhindra stuck to simple and pleasant patterns on the mridangam for this kriti.A rich and full-bodied alapana of Arabhi was the highlight of the day. Though robust, the melody was never compromised. Nalina Mohan on the violin exhibited an equally flourishing alapana. &#8216;Jootamu Rare' of Tyagaraja followed, in which Sheela chose to sing elaborate niraval at the Charanam lines &#8216;Aagama Sancharoodata' and topped it with kalpanaswaras.After a brief sketch of Kannada, she rendered &#8216;Intha Kante Kavalena' composed by Patnam Subramania Iyer. The contribution of percussion to enhance the beauty of the piece rhythmically needs special mention.Cheerful moodMuthuthandavar composition &#8216;Sevikka Vendumayya' in Andolika was given a refreshing touch with confident landings in lower and upper madhyamas. The slow and soothing Varali raga kriti &#8216;Eti janma' of Tyagaraja set to misra chapu readied the listeners for the main item of the concert.Characteristic to its name, Mohanam is always a cheerful raga.Sheela's presentation with beautiful brigas in right quantity with open throated long karvais added charm. Nalina Mohan on the violin had ample scope for displaying her dexterity and she did succeed in her attempt to match the singer's alapana.&#8216;Nannu Palimpa' of Tyagaraja was noteworthy for the diction and clarity with which it was rendered. The thani was subdued, with the morsing sounding a little coarse at times.Sheela took &#8216;Na Ninodanya Beduva' presented in ragamalika and &#8216;Ranga Baro' in Sindubhairavi both composed by Purandaradasa for the concluding sessions.While the artists were engrossed in Mohanam, the arrangements for the next item, a dance-drama was on. The dancers numbering about 50 along with their helpers and the light/audio assistants swarmed the auditorium noisily and went on testing the coloured lights on stage. Though the singer braved the situation well, the listening pleasure diminished while the main item was on.It takes a lot of effort for an artist to play Carnatic music on an instrument like the saxophone.The sound has to be controlled, the keys that normally produce flat notes have to be handled in such a manner that they bring out the gamakas audibly, and there must be variety, yet the songs have to sound familiar.In sound controlG. RAMANATHAN took care of all these aspects in his concert. The day's main raga Kharaharapriya and Kalyani, the sub-major raga, were proof of his versatility. The lower scale sancharas were sober and intelligently moved to the middle scales when they become a little too loud.Ramanathan started brightly with the Hamsadhwani kriti &#8216;Abhishta Varada' by Tyagaraja.Madurai Balasubramanian rightly chose to use the electric violin to match the strong sounds of the sax. The fast paced swaras in the first item were added zing. The long karvais in Swati Tirunal's &#8216;Jaya Jaya Padmanabha' in Sarasangi, displayed the artist's proficiency in handling a Western instrument with elan.The Kalyani raga alapana by violinist Balasubramanian is worth mentioning. The kriti &#8216;Vasudevayani' was again a brisk piece before the leisurely Brindavana Saranga.Ramanathan dedicated his concert to his uncle T.V. Vasan, the ghatam exponent who passed away recently. Perhaps the accompanying percussionists of the day were inspired by this and it was reflected in their thani. An uncomplicated thani saw some rasikas keep the beat spontaneously.For the tukkada session, Ramanathan took up Papanasam Sivan's &#8216;Karpagame' in Madhyamavati, Tiruppavai of the day &#8216;Ongi Ulagalanda' in Arabhi and Purandaradasa's &#8216;Jagadodharana.'It was a concert of melody and liveliness in right proportions.
