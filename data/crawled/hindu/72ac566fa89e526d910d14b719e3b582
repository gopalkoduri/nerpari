VCELEBRATING THE `Vasantotsav' (Holi), Visakha Choir organised a delightful recital of Rabindra Sangeeth interspersed with the rendering of some select Bhojpuri and Nazrul `geeth' besides a few ghazals, `tumris' and Bengali `Aadhunik'.Mainly comprising singers like Thanusri Chatterjee, Mithul Bhattacharjee, Sumana Mondal, Sarmistha Mondal, Jaya Chattarjee, Mousini Sarkar, Mohuva Dutta, Subhash Mondal, Ajoy Banerjee and Tapan Kumar Paul, the choir, which is a brainchild of the Kendriya Vidyalaya music teacher Madhusudan Banerjee, started functioning under his stewardship recently.The main objective of the choir, according to Madhusudan, is to revive the age-old tradition of celebrating the advent of various seasons, the spring in particular, and keeping up the custom that has been set with fervent ardour by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore in West Bengal, especially the Santiniketan in the modern period of Indian history.A perfect synchrony was achieved between the different voices with a soulful involvement of all the singers.  Subtle expressions emotionally embedded in the lyrics plus the intricacies involved in the set up of music marked the presentation.Some of the solos and duets presented by Jaya Chatterjee, Mithul Bhattacharjee and Ajay Banerjee stood out. Over all, the programme of about two hours created an impression of being a panoramic spectrum of the splendour of the spring sculpted in space in the medium of music.While Madhusudan himself adroitly played on harmonium, Prabir Banerjee playing on tabla with élan surfaced the `laya' intricacies with acumen.Smritha Dutta, Roopsha Bhattacharjee, Sanjana and Sanchari Sarkars', all children below ten, delighted all alike by dancing to the tunes of some select numbers.The enticing environs of the sprawling lawns of the historic Hawamahal right opposite of the beach (a summer resort that was built by the Maharajas of the erstwhile Jeypore Samsthanam of Orissa) on which the show was held was yet another feature that uplifted the mood.A.
