VLayavidya Pratishtana had organised a flute jugalbandhi (Carnatic and Hindustani ) by S.G. Muralidhar and Samir L. Rao.H.L. Shivashsankaraswamy (mridanga) and Vishwanath Nakod (tabla) supported such a confluence of masculine elegance and feminine delicacies exclusive to the respective systems.As an overture to the main programme, young percussionists (mridanga and ghata) of the institute treated the audience with a flow of melodic vibrant beats set to aadi and rupaka talas. Serving as an excellent illustration of perfect synchronisation, their crisp beats neither stumbled nor overlapped at any stage and in any pace.Both the flautists&#8217; remarkable control over the instruments, a thorough delving into the subject and intuitive mutual reciprocal enabled the showcasing of refined and salient touches &#8211;&#8212; both in matters of melody and rhythm.Alapana in Hamsadhvani in both the styles progressed into Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Vatapi Ganapathim&#8221;. Specialised work on the lyrics led the audience to appreciate pallavi and anupallavi as a gath. Propelled by such an interesting beginning, improvisations incessantly grew to perceptible heights. Creativity latticed musical phrases turned into beautiful melodic patterns to the joy and approval of the audience.While elaborating Hamsanandi and Purya, they diligently maintained a clear distinction between the two. Further, due care was exercised to prevent other samaprakrithi ragas &#8212; Marva and Sohini (the latter having close affinity to Hamsanandi) from getting into the field.It was again a creation and quenching of both anticipations and curiosities when the expatiation of the main ragas comprising catching taanas and jods narrowed down to pallavi &#8211; &#8220;Shivashankara Harashankara&#8221;.A new experience awaited the audience when the artistes gave a feel of different ragas in the fashion of Dhuns, while elaborating on Brindavani, Todi, Hindola and so on, following the pallavi.***Archana Bennur gave her vocal concert at Shri Krishnamurthipuram Ramamandira accompanied by Smitha (violin) and Bhargava (mridanga).The young artiste is endowed with a silvery voice which can reach higher octaves with considerable ease, getting even finer as it ascends the scale. Maybe opting for a higher basic tonic (adhara shadja) would have provided a marked assertive lift to her voice and style.&#8220;Eranapai&#8221; (Varna &#8211;Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer) rendered in different paces reinforced by consistency and stability, vouched for the above observations.Except for an undesirable extension of shades of Thodi into the beginning of &#8220;Sharanusiddhi Vinayaka&#8221; (Nata- Purandaradasa), she presented the rest of the lyrics with verve and involvement.Exposition of Pantuvarali (&#8220;Shambho Mahadeva&#8221; - Shri Thyagaraja) was methodical and scholarly. By suitably employing a variety of graces and emotive articulations, she convincingly expanded the lyrics at &#8220;Surabrinda Kiritamani&#8221; appending it with acute kalpanaswaras.With due care, she could have averted an accidental slipping &#8212; of Kalyani into Thodi (&#8220;Koluvamaregada Kodandapani&#8221; - Thyagaraja).V.
