VThe two main pieces of the kutcheri, Varali (&#8216;Kaa Vaa Vaa&#8217; of his grandfather, Papanasanam Sivan) and Kharaharapriya (&#8216;Chakkani Raja Margamulu&#8217;) were replete with grand phrases, improvised on the spot. Yet, the lilt, the intoxication came at the tail pieces, &#8216;Narajanma Bandaga&#8217; of Purandaradasa (Madhuvanti), &#8216;Maname Kanamum&#8217; (bhimplas) and a vrittam followed by Chandrasekhara in Sindhu Bhairavi. These pieces were real gems.Earlier, Ashok Ramani started the concert with a Bhairavi varnam which was followed by  &#8216;Deva Deva&#8217; (mayamalava gowlai) and &#8216;Padmanabhan Maruga&#8217; of Sivan in Nagaswarali.The vocalist was accompanied by R.K.Sriramkumar on the violin and Arun Prakash on the mridangam. Both accompanists, veterans in their fields, provided admirable support. The violinist&#8217;s essay of Kharaharapriya in particular was remarkable.
