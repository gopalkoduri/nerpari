VThere's always something special in a Sanjay Subrahmanyan concert. He is one of those singers who does not meander along a set track, is not afraid to innovate even while rooted in tradition, and stuns you with his wide repertoire. There is some magic that draws in huge crowds who are willing to even stand for the entire duration of a concert. It was no different at the Kalikota Palace in Thripunithura.Thinking musicianSanjay is a lively, thinking musician who gets into the mood straightway. Perhaps it is his uncanny ability to break from a patterned mode, giving his concert that surprise element, which makes Sanjay a huge hit among rasikas. Take for instance his delineation of Todi, which he chose as the main raga for the evening.The kriti, in Carnatic classical, remains the main source to express the charm, structure and mood of a raga. But Sanjay got into a creative exploration of the raga, not restricting himself to specific notes or patterns stipulated by the particular system. He delved deep into the mood of the raga. The Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Enduku dayaradura&#8230;' was there, the emotional content of Tyagaraja's personal conversation with Lord Rama, came out in those specific tones of melody. But the beauty was that Sanjay went to paint a full picture of the raga, all its shades and colours. Todi was not confined to the limitations of the kriti. Sanjay set it free, he virtually decoded the raga.Right from the varnam in Malavi, Sanjay set the tone for the evening. He, then, slipped easily into a couple of traditional pieces such as &#8216;Marubalka&#8230;' (Sriranjini) and Swati Tirunal's &#8216;Palaya sada&#8230;' in Nalinakanthi. The sarvalaghu swaraprastharas on the violin by M. A. Sundaresan for the Swati kriti was spontaneous.Along with the legendary composers, Sanjay makes it a point to sing Tamil compositions. His passion for Tamil came to fore in his choice of Koteeswara Iyer's &#8216;Velum mayilum&#8230;' in the complicated Sucharithra, not a popular raga but certainly a profound one. Sanjay handled the vivadi swaras with &#233;lan. Although connoisseurs believe that melody is difficult in this raga, both in alapana and kalpanaswaras, Sanjay imparted a touch of melody and the right bhava for the piece.A brisk Ravichandrika (like &#8216;Niravathi sukhada&#8230;') was followed by a mesmerising virutham in Desh, Bhairavi, Hamirkalyani, Surutti and Sindhubhairavi. This, once again, highlighted Sanjay's fondness for Tamil kritis and the passion with which he renders them.Sundaresan's responses right through the concerts were soft and melodious. His playing anticipated every nuance of the concert, thus enhancing the vocalist's rendition and elevating the concert to another level of excellence.Mannargudi Easwaran (mridangam) and S. Karthik (ghatam) showed their expertise, experience and imagination in a neatly packed &#8216;tani' set to Misrachappu (four matras). The concert was held under the aegis of G.N. Swamy Trust Sangeetha Vidyalaya as part of the memorial day of the eminent mridangam vidwan G. Narayanaswamy.
