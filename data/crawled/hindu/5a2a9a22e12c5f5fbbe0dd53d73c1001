VWhile audio cassettes and compact discs help learn music to some extent, the physical presence of the guru needs no special emphasis. This is perhaps why noted veena exponent Pudukkottai R. Krishnamurthy of Tirupati has come up with the novel idea of interaction-based e-learning material to impart training in both vocal and veena.The only top grade veena artiste of AIR/Doordarshan in Andhra Pradesh since 1960, Krishnamurthy has brought out a set of twelve DVDs that starts from the basics of Carnatic music and ends with kirthanas. The material covers the classical music in ancient India and also traces the history of veena, the fingering pattern and other technical aspects. The material is almost exclusive in providing tips on servicing the veena and periodical overhaul.Expressing concern over the general fall in interest and knowledge of music, Krishnamurthy says rasikas should be exceptionally conversant with the basics to appreciate classical music. &#8220;While vocalists sustain the listeners' interest through devotional or romantic literature, the absence of the same is a serious shortcoming for instrumentalists; as a result the ability to understand the nuances of musical instrument has further plummeted,&#8221; he says regretfully.It is with the intention of catching the artistes young by employing modern day techniques that he has developed the DVD set, each of which runs for 90 minutes. Portraying Krishnamurthy as the guru and his wife Padma Krishnamurthy as the disciple seeking clarifications, the lively interaction addresses many of the doubts of the common learners.The set is priced at Rs.1500. Krishnamurthy can be contacted at 9440046511 for more details.
