VThrissur V. Ramachandran and Maharajapuram S. Ramachandran presented  concerts on the first two days. On the third day, R. Suryaprakash sang  well-known kritis in an enjoyable manner. His delineation of Subhapanthuvarali preceding Tyagaraja&#8217;s kriti, &#8216;Ennaallu Oorage&#8217; was full of delicious pathos. He followed it up with scintillating swarakalpanas for &#8216;Manavyalakincharadhate&#8217; in Nalinakanti. &#8216;Maa Janaki&#8217; in Khambodi  and &#8216;Intha Sowkyamani Ne&#8217; in Kapi (centre piece) were rendered elaborately. As a true disciple of T.V.Sankaranarayanan, he specialises in swarakalpanas, soft and caressing at times and racy and torrential at others.  &#8216;Deivangal Arul Seydha Ragangale,&#8217; a ragamalika (his own composition) was interesting.  Mullaivaasal Chandramouli&#8217;s violin was a feast for  the ears. Delhi S. Sairam exuded energy and speed as he gave support on the mridangam and  E.M.Subramaniam was excellent on the ghatam.Shertalai K.N.Ranganathan Sharma had won a sizeable number of admirers by the time he finished his thoroughly enjoyable concert the following day. He has all the advantages required for a performing artiste &#8212; a pleasing personality, a rich voice, good training and the ability to maintain the tempo till the end. The majestic kriti in Mayamalava Gowla, &#8216;Meru Samana Dheera&#8217; describing Rama as a valiant hero  gave a perfect beginning to a wholesome concert. He presented some of the lesser-known kritis in well-known ragas. After his elaborate delineation of Devagandhari, he sang, &#8216;Kshithija Ramanam Chinthaye&#8217; by Dikshitar and after the vivid alapana in Mukhari, he began &#8216;Muripemu Galige Gadha&#8217; by Tyagaraja.In this kriti, the bard gives a lovely description of the beautiful edifices in Tiruvaiyaru and the incomparable cool breeze (Eeduleni Malayamaruthamu) on the banks of the  Cauvery. Mysore Vasudevachar&#8217;s &#8216;Bhajana Seya Radha&#8217; in Dharmavati was another solid piece. He even managed to present an RTP in Hamir Kalyani with the pallavi, &#8216;Nee Padhamule Gathiyeni Nammithi Sri Ramachandra&#8217; with kalpanaswaras in different ragas. He concluded  with &#8216;Rama Manthrava Japiso,&#8217; the Meera bhajan, &#8216;Tum Bin  More Kaun  Khabar Le&#8217; and a tillana. He had taken care to plan his concert well, selecting kritis by various composers in different languages.Mullaivasal Chandramouli accompanied him on the violin with his usual expertise.  Delhi Sairam on the mridangam and E.M.Subramaniam on the ghatam enjoyed themselves and added to the impressiveness of the concert.M. Chandrasekharan presented his violin concert along with Desamangalam S. Varadharajan. The humility of this great genius is worth emulating. He does not seem to remember that it is he who is performing. He loses himself in the melody whether it is he who produces it or the others. His open appreciation of everything good is contagious. The audience got the highest compliment that day and he almost claimed that the artistes performed so well only because of the encouragement given by such a wonderful audience. He began with &#8216;Viriboni,&#8217; the Ata tala varnam in Bhairavi. &#8216;Vathapi Ganapathim Bhajeham&#8217; (Hamsadhwani - Dikshitar) had the desired effect. He presented the following kritis by Tyagaraja, &#8216;Ninne Nera Namminanura&#8217; (Kamavardhini), &#8216;Melukovayya&#8217; (Bowli) and &#8216;Sarasa Samadhana&#8217; (Kapi Narayani) with suitable introductions and relevant anecdotes. &#8216;Thaye Yashodha&#8217; in Thodi was taken up as the main piece and this delightful song by Oothukkadu Venkatasubbaiyer won great appreciation.Mridangam by Mannargudi Eswaran was  pleasant and Chandrasekharan described it as &#8216;mriduvaana mridangam&#8217;. Ghatam by Suresh was remarkably lively and during the &#8216;thani,&#8217; both the artistes tried to outdo each other.Malladi Brothers Sri Ramaprasad and Ravikumar concluded the  series as they sang to a  full-house audience.
