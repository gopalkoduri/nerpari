VFor the third consecutive year,  Bharatiya Sangeetha Vaibhavam Trust organised a marathon music tribute to Muthuswami Dikshitar.  The 9-9 event  that took place at Sivagami Pethachi Auditorium featured nine vocalists, who presented the less-heard kri\u000atis of Dikshitar.As mentioned by the Sanskrit scholar Dr. Madhavan at the outset, most of the kritis of Muthuswami Dikshitar are in chaste Sanskrit and demand extraordinary skill in pronunciation and enunciation.Sikkil Gurucharan, who opened the akhandam,  proved that he is an artist whose music shines by quality and charm. The one-hour concert had been meticulously designed and the vocalist started  with the  Sriranjani daru &#8216;Nee sati daivamu.&#8217;A captivating alapana of Abheri  was followed by the kriti, &#8216;Veena beri venu.&#8217; Fast moving popular number &#8216;Sri Balasubramanya&#8217; in Bilahari sans alapana but with a niraval at &#8216;Kanakavalli devasenapathe&#8217; occupied the main slot. &#8216;Sri Dakshinamurthy&#8217; in Phenadythi, &#8216;Ardhanareeswaram&#8217; in Kumudakriya and &#8216;Panchashath peeta roopini&#8217; in Devagandharam completed his vocal recital.One cannot but agree with the fact that while rendering Dikshitar kritis, most of the times, the raga alapana and niraval-swaras  only serve to showcase the performer&#8217;s expertise rather than elevate the inimitable compositions.Bearing this in mind, Gurucharan had chosen  ragas of varying nature and the songs set to different rhythmic structures.  V Sanjeev on the violin provided his share with credit in raga essays and niraval. Neyveli Skandasubramanyam and B.S Purushotham took care of the percussion with expert touches on mridangam and kanjira.Seetha Rajan is an exceptional guru and eminent performer. She, along with her disciples, presented  compositions, hitherto unheard, of the great composer by simple uncomplicated rendition.   The presentation was superior in content and sonorous to hear in the cohesive singing of her highly disciplined group.The brief preface given by Seetha Rajan before each kriti made the listener enjoy the item with better insight. She had chosen the compositions of Dikshitar on Lord Siva of different places.  They were &#8216;Sada saleswaram&#8217; in Bhoopalam (Tiruvarur), &#8216;Rudrakopa jaata veerabhadra&#8217; in Rudrapriya (Tiruvengadu), &#8216;Vadanyeswaram&#8217; in Devagandhari (Vallalar Koil), &#8216;Sringaraadi&#8217; in Dhavalanga (Tanjavur) , famous &#8216;Tyagaraja yoga vaibhavam&#8217; in Anandabhairavi (Tiruvarur), &#8216;Chidambara Nataraja&#8217; in Tanukeerti (Chidambaram), &#8216;Sri Valmika lingam&#8217; in Kamboji (Tiruvarur) and the grand finale with the breathtakingly beautiful and incredibly testing chaturdasa ragamalika &#8216; Sri Viswanatham&#8217; on Kuzhikkarai deity.There cannot be a better tribute to the composer of amazing intellect than that offered by Seetha Rajan and group. She was supported by L Ramkrishnan on the violin, Neyveli Skanthasubramaniyam and BS Purushotham on the rhythm.Gayathri Venkataraghavan pitched on the heavy weight ragas and kritis from Dikshitar&#8217;s treasure chest. Gayathri&#8217;s focus always rests on the splendour of the raga image and therefore, the two ragas she served in entirety radiated brilliance &#8212; Kasi Ramakriya (Pantuvarali) and Sri. Her expression of Kasi Ramakriya was painted with very bright phrases. The kriti &#8216;Senapathe palayamam&#8217; on Lord Shanmukha was vivacious infusing more appeal through an inspiring niraval in &#8216;Kanaka kundala sobita sundara.&#8217; The finer inflections Gayathri added in the pallavi &#8216;Senapathe&#8217; after each kalpanaswaras was something special of an artist who feels a raga with great understanding. The Sri raga exposition cruised through the passage of unmitigated karvais linked carefully.The chosen composition &#8216;Tyagaraja mahaadwaja roha&#8217; was indeed a magnificent number elaborately describing the Lord with his awesome pomp and pageantry. &#8216;Tarakeswara dayanithe&#8217; in Sankarabharanam and &#8216;Santhana Gopalakrishnam&#8217; in Khamas were the other inclusions. Akkarai Subbulakshmi on the violin responded with matching inspiration of the singer. Mannarkoil Balaji dutifully followed the proceedings without much ado.The programme definitely threw light on  some of the wonderful compositions of the legendary composer and also motivated the artists  to search, learn and present the same in this special forum to the delight of the connoisseurs.
