VKamban En Kadhalan &#8212; Sivakumar(Ramayanam through 100 verses)DVDMoser Baer Entertainment Ltd.Price: Rs.99Juxtaposing Kambar&#8217;s tongue-twisting verses and colloquial Tamil with right voice modulation and presenting the entire story of Rama without a single piece of reference material before him is no ordinary achievement. So far even expert orators \u000aon Kambar and exponents of religious discourses have not narrated the entire Ramayana in a day. Leave alone a day, Sivakumar has accomplished it in a matter of just two and half hours! &#8220;&#8216;It is a world record,&#8217; lauded Tamizharuvi Manian. &#8216;An ovation such as this from a whole crowd of around 5,000 young college students who sat enraptured as I went on, has never before been witnessed in any corner of the globe,&#8217; he told me,&#8221; says Sivakumar.The feat, at a college near Erode, which was telecast on Vijay TV recently, has now come out as a DVD.Released by Moser Baer, &#8216;Kamban En Kadhalan&#8217; is a must-buy for every family, to drink in the beauty of the Tamil language through 100 verses of Kamban and also absorb the Ramayana the easy way.Solomon Pappiah complimented Sivakumar thus: &#8220;Why just 100? You have explicitly touched upon at least another 1,000 Kamban verses in story telling style.&#8221; True, Sivakumar quotes 100 and gives a gist of the rest in conversational tongue.Ilampirai Manimaran, an orator in her own right and an authority on &#8216;Kamba Ramayanam,&#8217; added another feather to Sivakumar&#8217;s cap when she told him, &#8220;If you had studied the epic for a decade and then undertaken the task I wouldn&#8217;t have been surprised. But taking just about a year or so to read, format and get the oration ready is a superhuman effort.&#8221;&#8220;Our literature is priceless and &#8216;Kamba Ramayanam&#8217; transcends religion. If my attempt draws at least a few youngsters to the greatness of our Tamil works and helps them imbibe the values in them, I&#8217;d feel gratified,&#8221; says Sivakumar.&#8216;Kamban En Kadhalan&#8217; is available  at leading stores including Music World, Landmark, Odyssey, Ramaraj Cotton show rooms and Sankara Hall, and also all over the country. What&#8217;s more, Moser Baer is marketing the DVD the world over!
