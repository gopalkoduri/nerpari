VEighty-six-year old veteran H.S. Gururajacharya, popularly known as Gururajachar, is considered Bheeshmacharya of music in Hyderabad Carnatic concert circles. If any one wants to know more about Purandaradasa and his compositions, Gururajachar is an authority. His concerts invariably have some compositions of Purandaradasa. It was a delight to watch this veteran giving a vocal recital for Nada Bharati last week at Mahati Hall in DD Colony as part of the sabha&#8217;s traditional concert series. The way he maintained hissrutiandlayaat this age was quite astonishing. He is regarded as a gentleman in this field who encourages the younger lot.
