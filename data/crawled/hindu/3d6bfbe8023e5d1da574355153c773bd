VThe disc begins with a well-conceived Sindhubhairavi composition of Kanyakumari, where accent is more on melody than on rhythm. The next is N. Ramani&#8217;s tillana in Nalinakanthi followed by the ever popular Sivaranjani number composed by Maharajapuram Santhanam. The orchestral  compositions for both these pieces blend into a seamless whole, unlike the umpteen Carnatic CDs flooding the market today, which virtually butcher great compositions with their heavy orchestra. . The Tanjore Quartet&#8217;s Kanada in  Tisra Nadai opens soothingly with a cascade of strings, flute and violin. An appealing piece with a judicious balance of melody and rhythm &#8212; Misra Kalyani (Mishrachapu) &#8212; composed by Kanyakumari and Sulochana Pattabhiraman also finds a place in the album. . M. Balamuralikrishna&#8217;s evergreen Brindhavani that oozes with the beauty of the raga has been well executed by Kanya and Sanjeev.The pick of the CD is Thanjavur S. Kalyanaraman&#8217;s Dwijavanthi. Kanya breaking off into the fourth string time and again adds grace. Due credit should be given to her for presenting a rare tillana in Thodi, very differently conceptualised by Ramanathpuram Srinivasa Iyengar.Marking the end is N. Ramani&#8217;s Madhyamavathi woven with felicitous phrases &#8212; a neat presentation. Punya Srinivas(veena) proves her mettle with expressive expositions even with taut strings. Palghat Sriram (flute) is equally adept. Rex and his group of violins and Solomon Augustine&#8217;s keyboard fuse well while Jayachandran (timings) is perfect.The rhythm support of K.V. Prasad (mridangam), A. S. Murali (ghatam) and Madhusudhan (tabla) is  noteworthy without being dominant.Kanyakumari takes credit for the concept and music for the orchestra, very passionately done. A. Dakshinamurthy&#8217;s orchestral arrangements move along  with the main theme. Sound Engineer Gopi&#8217;s brilliant work makes the fare enjoyable. Digitally recorded at Kothandapani Audio Lab, Subramanian has mastered the album. Useful for music students, this tillana collection is also a connoisseur&#8217;s delight.Kum.A.Kanyakumari &amp;V.
