VGood homework, a well-modulated voice and perfect swaras characterised the vocal recital of  young Rohit (disciple of Lalitha Sivakumar), a student  of Anna University under the auspices of Alapana, Coimbatore.  Rohit  was ably supported on the violin by Arunachala Karthick, an alumnus of the same university. Setting the kutcheri in motion with a varnam of Papanasam Sivan in Abhogi, the artiste revealed his zeal for neat renditions in  `Enta Nuchu' (Harikhambodi) and `Charanam Charanam' (Asaveri). `Orajupu'  (Kannadagowla) unfolded beautifully  and the accompanying swaras spoke of his intense sadhakam and perception.  However, his colourful portraits of Malayamarutham (`Manasa Etulo') and Charukesi (`Kripayapalaya') were marred by swara slips in the upper reaches.  The highlight of the concert was the RTP in Hamsanandhi and the raga sancharas in Anandabhairavi, Kannada, Neelamani and Behag.The promising musician has a bright future  provided he works on  the higher and mandara prayogas. The violinist's responses in raga alapanas and kalpanaswaras were laced with lyrical softness. Seasoned percussion support came from Babu.T.K.GANAPATHYBottom Template Starts
