VGeeta Krishnamurthy of Chennai, a postgraduate in English who worked as lecturer in Yethiraja College, Chennai, for some years, is also a senior and highly accomplished vainik. Her veena concert for Mummaneni Subba Rao Sidhartha Kala Peetham was a sumptuous treat in melody, musical depth and aesthetics.Geeta received her musical training from Chittibabu, Nedunuri Krishnamurthy, Trivendrum R.Venkataraman and D.

Geeta is also the recipient of the title &#8216;Veena Gana Mani' from the Tamil Isai Sangam of Madurai.In the concert Geeta Krishnamurthy showed fine command over the instrument and her plucking was flawless. The concert started with Sarasiruhasanapriye in Nata followed by Sitamma Mayamma in Vasanta. Janani Ninuvina which followed next was handled with dignified approach bringing out the soul of the raga Reetigowla. She sumptuously delineated while playing Muthuswami Dikshitar's Govardhana Gireesam in Hindolam. Another major item in the concert was Sri Kantimati in Hemavathi.Towards the close came Annapoorne Visalakshi in Sama and a thillana in Khamas. The veena vidushi was ably accompanied by M.
