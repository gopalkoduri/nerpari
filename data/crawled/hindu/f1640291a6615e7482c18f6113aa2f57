VVathapi: Ganesha MuraliManorama Music, Rs. 125This is an album in which the flute  extols the  glory and beauty of Lord Ganesha.Kudamaloor Janardanan explores  three immortal kritis of Muthuswami Dikshitar and gives it new shades.It is often said as a joke that if Dikshitar had copyrighted &#8216;Vaathapi,&#8217; it would have fetched him a  fortune. This is easily the most popular kriti in Carnatic music. Perhaps it was because of this  that Janardanan decided to give a different touch to this immortal kriti.Janardanan has conceptualised this composition with many parts and movements. He has introduced interludes of pure melody using  traditional temple instruments such as  chenda, edakka and thimila, blending them ingeniously with chants of Vedic mantras.  The effect is magical.The other two kirtis, &#8216;Siddhivinayakam&#8230;&#8217; (Shanmughapriya) and &#8216;Mahaganapatim&#8230;&#8217; (Natta) are also presented in a different style, delving deep into the mood of the compositions. In the former, Janardanan adopts a meditative rendering style, while in the latter he begins in a slow tempo and then moves into a faster rhythm, keeping in with the mood of the raga.This is a good buy.K.P.Bottom Template Starts
