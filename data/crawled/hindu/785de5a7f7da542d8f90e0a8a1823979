VPantula Rama is a dependable artist; her music will never fall short of expectations and the confidence she exudes makes it worth the while for  the listener.  In her concert for Sarvani Sangeetha Sabha at Music Academy Mini Hall, Rama, singer from Visakhapatnam, reiterated this once again to the Chennai audience.The concert&#8217;s tempo was maintained well with the requisite fast and leisurely paced kritis. Rama&#8217;s approach to raga alapana needs special mention. She pilots the raga most of the times with opening phrases in the upper registers. The karvais and brigas are bonded in a different format but at the same time never miss the logical progress of the raga, bringing forth its tones and mood.Valaji especially, though brief, showed certain innovative combination of motifs leading to &#8216;Jalandara Supeetasthe&#8217; of Muthiah Bhagavathar with a slightly hastened niraval and swaras in &#8216;Bhavaroga Nivarini&#8217;. Dharamavati as the sub main raga brought out some of Rama&#8217;s originality for the kriti &#8216;Bhajana Seya Rada&#8217; of Mysore Vasudevachar.The raga for the evening was Madhyamavati; the raga expose and Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Venkatesa Ninnu&#8217; went at a galloping speed. Naturally, the raga essay was loaded with more enticing spins than stirring extended stopovers. While the niraval at &#8216;Pankajaksha Paripalitha Muni Jana&#8217; was fully charged, the swara course was controlled initially but surged forth intensely with shadjam as the anchoring note for the korvai.The interspersed kritis were &#8216;Maha Ganapathim&#8217; in Nattai as the opening number, &#8216;Nenarunchara&#8217; in Simhavahini, &#8216;Pahimam Sri Raja Rajeswari&#8217; in Janaranjani with concluding numbers such as the popular &#8216;Gayathi Vanamali&#8217; (Sadasiva Brahmendrar), &#8216;Palukuthe Nena&#8217; of Annamacharya in Bhimplas and &#8216;Govinda Hari&#8217; in Maund. The Janranjani kriti had a special supplement of flying swaras at &#8216;Janaranjani Niranjani&#8217;.However, Rama&#8217;s voice did not cooperate too well this time and because of this, one could feel the microscopic slips here and there. M.S.N. Murthy, Rama&#8217;s husband and accompanist on the violin, carefully treaded his path with comprehension.. Murthy needs full score for fine responses in raga vinyasas and swara segments in his own style but effectively. Melakaveri K. Balaji kept the rhythm of the concert in the right track with a systematically developed and executed thani avartanam.
