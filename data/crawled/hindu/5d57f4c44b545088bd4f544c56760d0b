VGaanamruthamSathur SistersCarnatic Classical MG 005 _ Price Rs.50Sathur Sisters, Lalitha Santhanam and Bhuvana Rajagopalan, are the daughters and disciples of the late reputed vidwan, Sathur A.G. Subramaniam. Both have pleasant voices that blend harmoniously. The instrumental support  is provided by Charumathi Raghuraman on the violin, Thillaisthanam R. Suryanarayanan on the mridangam and Nanganallur S. Swaminathan on the ghatam. The compositions of Mangalam Ganapathy have been featured in this concert.The opening number, `Sureshwaram,' in Gambeeranattai with a lively chittaswaram sets an appropriate tone and rhythm for the agenda. The songs in Ritigowla and Dhanyasi  have a melodic bearing. `Nee Mahimalu' in Telugu, on Devi, prefaced by a brief alapana of Keeravani the niraval for the lyrics `Karunajoodave Kamakshi' and swara kalpanas finishing with an accurate korvai are sincere, accountable forays. Surya is a pentatonic scale similar to Hindolam but sports an antara gandharam instead of the sadharana gandharam. Its original name is `Sallabham.' `Surya Kulajatha' in this raga,  is an emotive interpretation.`Nee Aada Naan Paada' in tuneful Madhuvanti with nadai variations and the ragamalika with attractive ragas chosen from the Bhairavi group  also embellished with chittaswarams in each raga, leave a lingering aftermath.A Hindustani bhajan in Durga bids the listener a melodic adieu.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
