VMaharajapuram Santhanam has left behind a rich legacy and is an inspiration for many aspiring musicians. His son Srinivasan and grandson Ganesh too diligently follow the style of Santhanam, be it in raga vinyasa, choice of songs or swara kalpana. Their vocal concert for Shanmukhapriya at Swamy's Hall in Mylapore, began appropriately with &#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam' in Shanmukhapriya with dynamic swaras on &#8216;Prasiddha Gana Nayagam'.The father-son duo expertly showcased their puissant voices with apt modulation and open throated articulation. The most interesting part of their recital was their creativity in developing many fresh and innovative sangatis during the kriti renditions; some may have sounded light, but they carried their own magic in offering pleasant listening.The voices of the father and son blend seamlessly and even the switchover could hardly be recognisable.So their swara sections and the raga essays were shared with poise.Kalyanavasantham has an inherent breezy feel and Srinivasan's raga illustration was just marginal and airy with a few cosmetic touches. Came &#8216;Nadaloludai' of Tyagaraja where the myriad cascading sangatis in the anupallavi &#8216;Sadujana' surfaced, with the artists infusing interesting nuances.The Thodi treatise shared by Ganesh found certain gleaming phrases, spreading the raga profile with majesty.Individual style&#8216;Ninne Namminanu' of Syama Sastri and the usual niraval appended by swaras on &#8216;Kanjadalayadakshi Kamakshi' bore the stamp of the Maharajapuram school.Mohanam was a favourite of Santhanam and so also for his prot&#233;g&#233;s. Srinivasan and Ganesh drew a fetching sketch of the raga which suited their style of interpretation.Taking off from the anupallavi &#8216;Vanaja Nayana,' it was the compelling &#8216;Nannu Palimpa' of Tyagaraja that was chosen.The niraval at &#8216;Karamuna Chara Kothanda Kanthi' and the supplement swaras on daivatam were full of finesse and vivacity. Swaras are indeed meant to keep the audience attentive.However, Srinivasan can put some astuteness on this aspect by including swaras, not just to draw applause but to make them more aesthetically decorative and conventionally disciplined.M.A. Sundareswaran was in full form and some parts of his Mohanam alapana and Thodi essay were classic in quality and quantity.Thanjavur Kumar on the mridangam and Srirangam Kannan on morsing kept the agility of the concert in right earnest. The tani avartanam became an important and interesting part because young Ganesh sprang a surprise by joining the senior percussionists with sharp and strongly etched konnakkol; indeed, a rare and commendable talent of this promising vocalist. He smartly concluded the avartanam with a string of swaras followed by musical mnemonics.The concert covered many catchy kritis such as &#8216;Raghunayaka' in Hamsadhwani, &#8216;Chelimini Jalajaksha' in Yadukulakhambodi (both by Tyagaraja), &#8216;Mayamma' in Ahiri (Syama Sastri), &#8216;Nagagandhari' in Nagagandhari (Dikshitar), &#8216;Ezhil Migu Hamsanadam Enbom' (a beautifully composed number with the raga lakshana of Hamsanadam by Thanjavur Sankara Iyer) and &#8216;Govinda Ninne' (Purandaradasa) in Kalavathi.
