VThe five-day fete of Thyagaraja Aradhana conducted by Thyagaraja Aradhana Trust and Visakha Music and Dance Academy on the second day morning got off to a pious start with puja at the Thyagaraja mandir at Kalabharathi. Then followed Thiruveedhi coupled with Ooregimpu seva in which hundreds of adorers of the vaggeyakara participated. Later, inside Kalabharathi, the aradhana started with lighting of lamps before the picture of Thyagaraja (painting in oils) and about 150 artistes from in and around Visakhapatnam rendered the pancharatna kritis of the singer-composer in group in good unison.Then, after an half an hour recital on nadaswaram by Gurivilli Appanna and party, other recitals (recitals of duration 10 minutes up to 4.30 p.m., duration 15 minutes up to 5.30 p.m. and duration 30 minutes up to 9 p.m.) followed. Vocal, violin, veena, flute and nadaswaram recitals by junior, senior and professional artistes similarly were held on the next three days. Interestingly, a few, especially like G.R.K. Prasad (Rambabu), the secretary-trustee of VMDA, who organised the fete also sang for 10 minutes each. Though trained in Carnatic music from a very young age, he hadn't performed for more than three decades, but he soulfully and perfectly rendered two compositions tunefully and expressively.The series of recitals concluded with that of the Nedunuri. Rendering Rama Nee Samanamevaru (Kharaharapriya) with brief but beautiful alapana and neravu, he left an impression of being in a sojourn of the heart and soul of Thyagaraja. Anjaneyotsavam followed by puja and mantrapushpam led by the secretary of the trust, I.V.L. Sastry, was the fitting finale featuring 650 artistes in about 230 recitals.
