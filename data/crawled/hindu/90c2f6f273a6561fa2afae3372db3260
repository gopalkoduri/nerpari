VT.K. GANAPATHYMambalam Sisters,  Chitra and Vijayalakshmi  with their violinist sister, Hemalatha were high-spirited with exuberance, maintaining the tempo from the start with a winsome presentation of the composition, &#8216;Vandeham Jagathvallabham&#8217; (Hamsa\u000adhwani) in their vocal recital organised by the Paduka Seva Samithi in the august presence of  Srimath Andavan Swamigal at  Sri Jagannathaperumal temple.Their musical sensibilities attuned to the same wavelength and good synchronisation of their voices invested the recital with a refreshing quality.&#8216;Maragathamanimaya&#8217; (Aarabhi) was assertive and delicate in expression. &#8216;Sree Ranganatham Upasmahe&#8217; in Purnachandrika was mellow with sensitive structuring. Chitra&#8217;s Kanada alapana for the kriti, &#8216;Godadevi Sadha Bhajami&#8217; was a grammar-friendly interpretation of the raga with fascinating variations in the higher octaves.The vibrant swara duel sparkled. &#8216;Ksheerasagara&#8217; in Devagandhari could have been sung with more involvement with an alapana preceding it. Vijayalakshmi&#8217;s raga vinyasam of Kalyani for the item, &#8216;Pankajalochana,&#8217; was a good effort though the rasikas could feel occasional discords in the tara sthayi. The tukkadas towards the end were noteworthy. Hemalatha&#8217;s violin accompaniment enjoyed an edge over vocal duo in responding to the notes to perfection in the raga alapanas of Kanada and Kalyani with several attractive musical phrasings. The thani provided by Sivakumar on the mridangam and Rangachari on the kanjira was absorbing.Visranthi and sukhanubhavam marked the violin solo recital of T.N.Krishnan held in the august presence of Andavan Swamigal at the Sri Jagannathaperumal temple here under the aegis of Paduka Seva Samithi.That violin speaks in his deft handling of the bow is an understatement, as was seen in the session demonstrating his penchant for creativity steeped in  melody.A harmonious blend of the rakti aspects of the ragas and his own swanubhava produced euphony spellbinding the rasikas. The opening, &#8216;Maakelara&#8217; in Ravichandrika with a battery of swaras left the listeners in high spirits. The raga vinyasam of Khamas following this number with strains of alluring sancharas transformed the raga into an attractive structure.The strands of Panthuvarali for the kriti, &#8216;Raghuvaranandana&#8217; explored the charms of the raga stage by stage.The elaboration of Anandabhairavi for the item, &#8216;Mariveregati&#8217; had all the qualities of a well composed symphony.The tonal subtleties of Abheri while caressing the raga nuances for &#8216;Nagumomu&#8217; and the exciting round of swaraprasthara were aesthetically pleasing to the ear.&#8216;Hecharika&#8217; (Yadukulakhambodi) and &#8216;Saravanabhava&#8217; in Shanmukhapriya found instant favour with the rasikas.The laya interlude provided by Mannargudi Easwaran (mridangam) and Tripunithura Radhakrishnan (ghatam) enhanced the dignity of the kutcheri.Towards the end of the programme, the artistes were honoured with a shawl  and Krishnan was made the asthana vidwan of the ashram by Andavan Swamigal.Bottom Template Starts
