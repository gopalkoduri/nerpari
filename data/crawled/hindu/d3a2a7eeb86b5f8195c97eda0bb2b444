VS arvani Sangeetha Sabha took a welcome initiative by organising a special concert covering lesser known music composers of South India. Dr. S.A.K. Durga introduced these vaggeyakkaras to the audience and brought out the general meaning and significance of each one of the songs as they were being sung.Dr. Durga said that though these composers &#8211; Adhibhatla Narayanadas, Kumara Ettendra, Vijaya Dasa and Iravivarman Thampi -- are not known in the 21st century, they were quite popular in their period. Adhibhatla Narayanadas, a musicologist and a musician, a versatile genius who knew Sanskrit, French, Persian, Arabic and Telugu was the &#8220;unparalleled pithamaha of the Harikatha&#8221;. He had translated the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and had impressed Rabindranath Tagore by rendering the ragas Behag and Sindhubhairavi in a grand manner.Lyrical beauty intactP.B. Srirangachari, the day's singer, was in Dr. Durga's words &#8220;another less known but brilliant performer&#8221;. He chose songs from Narayanadas' &#8216;Yadartha Ramayana' and rendered them in Begada, Purvikalyani, Khambodhi and Yamuna Kalyani. There was a delightful alapana for Purvikalyani and all the songs were dealt with utmost care to bring out the beauty of the lyrics in their entirety.Kumara Ettendra who ruled Ettayapuram was also a vainika and a proficient composer.The songs were mainly in Tamil and mentioned the name of the deity of Kazhugumalai (Lord Muruga) in its lyrics thus becoming the mudhra of this composer.The lyrics had decorative end patterns, a distinguishable feature of Tamil poetry (Edhugai and Monai), and the chittaswaram for the songs were formed in a characteristic style.Nisha Rajagopal who sang this set of songs in Vasantha, Mukhari, Sankarabharanam and Rudrapriya had learnt some of them directly from the Sangita Sampradaya Pradarsini -- no mean task by any standards. Her alapana for Sankarabharanam had sowkhyam as its mainstay and all the songs with straight and simple lyrics in Tamil had bhava as its core.Vijayadasa, who has composed as many as 25,000 songs in Kannada, was ranked next to Purandara Dasa. His compositions have deep philosophical meaning. Some of the songs were tuned by Koviladi Rangarajan (Madhwaprasad's father).Koviladi Madhwaprasad who had taken up these compositions employed the ragas Hamsadhwani, Saveri, Kapi and Suddha Dhanyasi. His last number, a ragamalika had 11 ragas. The Kapi alapana had elements of class and the singer brought alive the beauty of the Kannada language.Dr. Durga clarified that &#8216;Gajavadhana,' the first song, may not have been composed by the vaggeyakara originally in Hamsadhwani -- a raga of later day invention.Khambodi, kummi, koelIravivarman Thampi's songs in Malayalam (and Sanskrit) were sung by the soft-voiced Sudhir Warrrier. Though much is not known about Thampi's training in music, he had the distinction of having composed five varnams, 33 kirtanas and 22 padams, and was the &#8216;Asthana Kavi' in Swathi Tirunal's court. He has also composed three Kathakali &#8216;Aattakathas' &#8211; &#8216;Keechaka Vadham,' &#8216;Daksha Yagam' and &#8216;Uthara Swayamvaram.' &#8216;Bogeendra Sayenam' attributed to Swathi Tirunal and sung in Kuntalavarali is found among Thampi's manuscripts, with the raga being mentioned as Dhanyasi. Sudhir Warrier picked up songs from the &#8216;Uthara Swayamvaram' and rendered them in Kalyani and Yadukula Khambodi.There was also a &#8216;Kummi' in Anandha Bhairavi and a fine lullaby towards the end where the shrill note uttered by the koel is equated with the panchama swaram in a poetic manner.Venkatasubramaniam on the violin and Krishnamachari on the mridangam accompanied the four singers. They limited themselves to optimum levels in terms of performance and concert space, thus according primacy to Dr. Durga's narration and commentary.The venue of the event was Kasturi Srinivasan Hall, The Music Academy.
