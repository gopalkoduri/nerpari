VAshvini Satish, a young artiste of laudable commitment to uphold the lofty ideals of Indian music in its true spirit of devotion and fine sentiments, presented her vocal concert at Ganabharati.She is endowed with a rare articulation, drawing inspiration from the lyrics of the composers of high rank.For the above reason, throughout the concert, an aura of pleasant ambience kept radiating, and her fine tuned scholarship rendered the numbers balanced, melodic and pleasing.Carefully honed voice has subtle timbre and is expandable to traverse over the desired octaves. The artiste's diction was in furtherance of highlighting the imports of the lyrics and the trained voice easily modulated to foster the emotive aspects.&#8220;Shri Mahaganapathi&#8221; (Gowla- Dikshithar), &#8220;Niravadhi Sukhada&#8221; (Ravichandrika-Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Palaya Mam Kollapuravasini&#8221; (Purvikalyani-Surapurada Ananda Dasaru) were the early numbers justifying the above observations.A tempo falling between vilamba and madhyama kaalas supported ideal progressions. Instead of exploiting the raga Ravichandrika to exhibit virtuosity (rhythm exercises for instant appeal, as is usually practiced by many artistes not excepting even the noted ones), the singer explored the essence of the composition &#8220;Niravadhi Sukhada&#8221;, making it meaningful, majestic and melodic, in tune with the composer's lofty intentions.&#8220;Shri Narada Naada&#8221; (Kaanada &#8211; Thyagaraja) evoked mixed response. Alapana went by the scale of the raga rather than by its mood or the personality. In this area, the melody accompanist's (H.M. Smitha) airs scored well to a marginal degree. In contrast, the lyrical section and the neraval at Veda Janita Vara Veena (and the swaraprastara section as well), deserved all unreserved appreciations. Rhythm effects by both the percussionists - Kumaraswamy (mridanga) and S. Manjunath (ghata - added lustre to the artiste's style of progressions).The artiste's aesthetic sense and competence shot to the fore in Raga (Lathangi), Taana and Pallavi. Nevertheless, she could have represented Lathangi more clearly and comprehensively: articulations around Gandhara, Nishadha (chayaswaras) and Rishabha (nyaasa swara) in the middle octave could have been more impressive for an alluring and distinct portrayal of the personality of Lathangi.Jayachamaraja Wadiyar's &#8220;Bhajare Manasa&#8221; (Purnachandrika), Purandaradasa's &#8220;Innu Dayabaarade&#8221; (Kalyanavasantha) and Balamuralikrishna's Thillana (Brindavani) were some of the other highlights.
