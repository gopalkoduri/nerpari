VComprising a set of nine love numbers, `Oru Murai Paarthadhum,' written by Samson and composed by K. Gautam, has some hummable refrains.V. M. Karthik Kumar's voice dominates the audio CD (manufactured and marketed by Vedu Electronics, e mail:vedusrcl@yahoo.comPh: 9144 2858 4757/58). He has rendered three of the songs.Expressive numberThe opening number, `Oru Murai,' in Karthik Kumar's voice, is expressive. Yodelling a little for effect, Tipu has sung `Kaadhaliyae,' which has an interesting Tamil  -   English mix in the lyric, in keeping with the trend.Among the other presentations, the voices sound slightly off key in the last song of the CD &#151;  `Oru Murai' (Harmony). In fact, the last few compositions of Gautam that include the ones sung by Mahati and Sindhuri, are nothing much to write home about.The beats of `Hey Manmadha' give a foot-tapping rustic feel, while melody is the high point of `Poo Meedhu' sung by Prasad. The CD cover has a shoulder that says `When sound blends with love ... ' while the slug confidently states `We have arrived.'
