VTrichy Pradeep Kumar, whose music is assimilative rather than characteristic of a particular style, seems to  adept at  light and classical music. His recital at the Kerala Fine Arts Society in Kochi underscored this fact.He started off the concert in a melodic vein with &#8216;Chalamela,&#8217; a varnam in Nattakurinji raga and  chose two apt speeds that did not hinder the flow of the melody. The vocalist displayed excellent breath control as he sang long phrases during the alaapana and full lines in the kritis.&#8216;Sidhi vinayakam seveham,&#8217; Muthaiyah Bhagavathar&#8217;s beautiful composition in Mohanakalyani set to Adi tala,  was lucidly rendered. The melody was heightened with a few crisp swaras.The finesse attained till that moment  was lost with a hurried rendition of  &#8216;Deva Deva Kalayamithe&#8217; and also with the unwarranted overuse of brigas in the niraval &#8216;Jatharoopa nibhachela.&#8217; The short swaras had a clarity that the longer phrases lacked.The vara kriti &#8216;Divakaratanujam&#8217; was tagged on with &#8216;Ninnuvina gamari,&#8217; a Shyama Sastri kriti in Purvikalyani raga  misrachappu tala.There was a sincere attempt at bringing out the grandeur of the kriti. The niraval was rendered in the pallavi style of singing in the anulomam and pratilomam by the vocalist.However, all the lapses were covered with a detailed alaapana of Kharaharapriya. The soft feel of the raga in the initial phase was contrasted with a more vigorous approach towards the second and final stages,  with minute variations in the sustenance notes.Although a more diverse selection of kritis could have made the concert all the more appealing, the &#8216;Chakkani raja margamu&#8217; was sung to perfection by Pradeep Kumar in a medium tempo.A virutham in Mand raga was followed by the song &#8216;Muraleedhara gopala,&#8217; and the concert concluded with a rendition of Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s Behag tillana.The numerous systematic sangatis were reproduced to perfection by Nanjil Arun on the mridangam. Violinist T.H. Subramaniam in his distinct style  gave a more condensed version of the ragas.The thani by Arun on the mridangam, and Coimbatore Suresh on the ghatom was presented neatly without either of them going overboard  with the mathematics of the rhythmic structures.
