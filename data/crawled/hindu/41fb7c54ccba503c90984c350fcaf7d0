VTamil, as a liturgical medium, has spanned several centuries with the devout invoking their preferred deities in verse in all its poise.For their affiliations, savants have been grouped geographically, sociologically and theologically. Among them, the Tamizhisai Moovar comprising Arunachala Kavirayar (1711-1779), Muthu Thandavar (1560-1640) and Marimutha Pillai (17112-1787) hold a special place, with their lilting hymns providing the perfect vehicle to praise the Lord.The Tamizhisai Moovar festival was recently celebrated in Karur for the first time with the rendering of their hymns. The Department of Art and Culture, Tiruchi Region, in association with the Narada Gana Sabha, conducted the festival that showcased the talent of exponents.EnthrallingThe two-day programme began with Thevaram rendering by Dharmapuram S. Gnanaprakasam and Kudanthai &#8216;Vedhageetha' Lakshmanan whose mellifluous voice added to the religious fervour. This was followed by a veena recital by Srinidhi who brought alive the songs with plenty of emotion. Kashyap Mahesh entertained audiences with his alapana, which stood out in a couple of Kaviraya's songs.A nagaswaram performance by S. Sheikh Mehboob Subhani and Kalisha-bi Subhani reminded the audience that the instrument has a pride of place in festivals. Their racy rendering of Muthu Thandavar's kritis on Lord Nataraja was riveting.The highlight was the procession taken out of the Moovar by the artists.Nagaswaram and thavil players led the procession that helped the locals learn more about the contribution of the saint poets to Tamil literature. The aradhana saw &#8216;Koottu Isai Vazhipaadu' with artists performing the pancharatna kirtanas included &#8216;Ramanukku Mannar Mudi Tharithaale,' &#8216;Arumarunthu,' &#8216;Eesanukku Or', &#8216;Aadi Kondar Thillai' and &#8216;Oru Kal Siva Chidambaram.'
