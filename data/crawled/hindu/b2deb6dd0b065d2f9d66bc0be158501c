VSwarajhari&#8217;s monthly programme, this time around, presented a vocal concert by Mohan Santanam of Chennai, a disciple of late Mudigondan Venkatarama Iyer. The concert took place at Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram. Mohan Santanam sports a vibrant and robust voice but in a few places his notes particularly in themandra sthayi(lower octave) were slightly out of tune. However, the concert was impressive and Santanam&#8217;s monodharma aspects were imaginative and expressive. He started the concert withKambhojivarnam and followed it with Muthaiah Bhagavathar&#8217;s popular compositionGam Ganapathein Hamsadhvani, the Gowla pancharatna keertanaDudukugala ub GowlaandSogasuga mridanga talamuin Sriranjani.After singingAnanda Natana Prakasamin Kedaram Mohan Santanam efficiently rendered a pallavi in Todi set to Khandajati Triputa talam. The alapana, tanam and swarakalpana which adorned the pallavi amply projected the scholarship of singer.B.V. Durgabhavani who supported on violin played a fine version of Todi. N.S. Kalyanaraman&#8217;s mridangam support and his tani were also impressive. Towards the close of the concert, Mohan Santanam sang an Annamacharya keertana in Suryakantam,Gayati Vanamali, Sadasiva Bramhendra keertana and Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s Thillana in Rageswari.
