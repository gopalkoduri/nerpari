VVamshidhar is the great grandson of M. Venkatesha Iyengar of Mysore, an acknowledged exponent of veena and flute. He is also the grandson and disciple of V. Desikachar, a renowned flutist from Mysore. He is now under the tutelage of Vidwan D. Balakrishna, son and disciple of V. Doreswamy Iyengar, a renowned veena artiste, for advanced training.As his main item, Vamshidhar presented Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Koluvamaragada&#8221; in the raga Todi and handled the composition very well, giving  importance to various sangatis and playing them with clarity. Earlier, he delineated the raga in stages and delighted with some outstanding phrases. He followed this with melodic taanam not only in this raga but also in the ragas Nattai, Gowla, Arabhi, Varali and Shri.Traditionally, except  in the case of veena,  taanam  should  be followed by a pallavi. Presenting taanam in six ragas, Vamshidhar should have  presented a pallavi composed in these six different ragas, which, no doubt, would have been a Herculean task for  a youngster. Anyway, he  ignored this  tradition, and straightaway presented the Tyagaraja composition. Vamshidhar could have avoided playing taanam altogether  and instead played ragamalika swaraprastaras in these ragas towards the end, after completing his swaraprastaras in Todi. This is also a traditional pattern.Vamshidhar was ably supported by Delhi&#8217;s VSK Chakrapani on the violin and K.N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam. Vamshidhar also performed at Keshvapuram, Mayur Vihar and at the Sri Sankatahara Ganapathy Temple at Vasundhara Enclave. His  melodious flute  will linger long in the memory.In another concert at  the India International Centre, Kalyani Lakshminarayana from Secunderabad mesmerised rasikas during her veena recital. Among the songs Kalyani presented, Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Nedayaradha&#8221; in the raga Vasanta Bhairavi was emotive.  The charanam portion of the composition was handled especially well. Muttaiah Bhagavatar&#8217;s &#8220;Sudhamayi sudhanidhi&#8221; in  Amritavarshini was scintillating. Shyama Sastri&#8217;s &#8220;Janani ninuvina&#8221; in the raga Riti Gowla was handled well. The hallmarks of her main item, a Tyagaraja composition &#8220;Kalikiyunte&#8221; in the raga Kiravani, were an excellent alap, melodic taanam,  good handling of the composition, and rich swaraprastaras. However, use  of swaras beyond the note Pancham in the higher octave and below  Pancham in the lower octave for the swaraprastaras seemed  a meaningless exercise. Kalyani is the daughter and disciple of the late Emani Shankara Sastry. Delhi&#8217;s A. Premkumar provided good mridangam support.In  a concert organised by the Delhi Tamil Sangam as part of the Ramana Maharishi Jayanti celebrations, Chennai&#8217;s Gayathri Girish delighted rasikas, though her recital was  very brief. Singing mostly in Tamil,  she  presented  a number of shlokas and verses in the form of virittams, making good use of her manodharma talents. Gayathri was ably assisted by VSK Chakrapani on the violin, Lalgudi Ganesh on the mridangam and Thirumurugan on the morsing. One only wished that Gayathri had sung  longer.
