VBombay Jayasree's silken voice mesmerised students and aficionados of music during a SPIC MACAY programme at the M.D.R. Hall in Palakkad.Her performance was a beautiful blend of creativity and tradition. Jayasree's excellent rapport with accompanists Emmbar Kannan (violin) and Poonkulam Subrahmanian (mridangam), and her disciples Abhinaya and Poornima enhanced the melodic ambience of the concert.Right from the invocatory &#8216;Jaya jaya swamin,' a Tharangam of Narayanatheerthar in Natta, she was able to tune in to the mood of the listeners.A poignant presentation of &#8216;Karunanidhiye thaye,' a Tamil composition of Papanasam Sivan in Bouli, set to Misrachappu tala, was followed by a brisk &#8216;Manavyalakim.'Cascading swaraprastharaThe Tyagaraja kriti in Nalinakanthi, set to Adi tala, was embellished with cascading swaraprasthara. After a soulful rendering of &#8216;Sabhapathikku veru Deivam samanamakuma,' composed by Gopalakrishna Bharathi in raga Abhogi, set to Roopaka tala, Jayasree moved on to the nuclear of the concert &#8211; a meticulous alapana of Kharaharapriya.The soul-stirring exploration of the subtle nuances of the raga brought to fore the rakthi of the raga. Kannan portrayed the sancharas with dexterity. Tyagaraja's &#8216;Pakkala nilabati,' set to Misrachappu tala, highlighted the structural aesthetics and bhava of the kriti. Opulent niraval and pleasing manodharmaswara sequence at the charanam &#8216;Thanuvuche vandana' was followed by a superb Tani by Subrahmanian.The bhajans that followed &#8211; &#8216;Aye Giridhar Gopal' of Swati Tirunal and &#8216;Krishna nee begena baro' of Vyasarajar &#8211; were soaked in devotion. Jayasree concluded the concert with a Thillana of her guru, violin wizard Lalgudi Jayaraman, in raga Behag. Her concert had the listeners yearning to hear more of this melodious singer.
