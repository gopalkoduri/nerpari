VBhajan Classics India has released nine volumes (two cds each) under the title Sampradaya Bhajan Series, on the lines of the bhajan padhati laid down by Marudanallur Sri Sadguru Swamigal.The first volume begins with Thodaya Mangalam followed by Guru Dhyana keerthanams. Sung with gusto and impressive articulation Udayalur K. Kalyanaraman takes credit for the first volume. The next three volumes titled &#8220;Geetha Govinda Mahakavyam&#8221; has O.S. Sundar singing the 12th century monumental work of Kavi Jayadeva&#8217;s &#8220;24 Ashtapadis.&#8221; A few guru keerthanams including Padmavathi Ramanam (Poorvi Kalyani) composed by Oothukkadu Mahakavi Venkatesa Subbaier in praise of Jayadeva precede the hymns.The poorvanga-uttaranga slokas and the ashtapadis have all been rendered in traditional ragas in a slow paced manner that would help devotees to learn and repeat them. The raga rasa and the lyrics have been balanced very well by Sundar, who is also featured in the fifth volume comprising selections from Narayana Theerthar&#8217;s Krishna Leela Tharangini.More than 25 of Bhadrachala Ramadasa&#8217;s works make up the sixth and seventh volumes sung by Akondy Srinivasa Raja Rao with perfect diction.A.V. Rajasimhan renders soulfully, kritis of Purandaradasar, Sadasiva Brahmendral and Vijayagopala Yati in volumes eight and nine. Devotional fervour is the underlying tenor of the all these volumes rather than vidwat. R.Ramanathan, T.H. Venkatesa Iyengar, Sankar Raman, Thrissur Manikandan (harmonium), Mullaivasal G. Chandramouli, Rahul , Karaikkal Venkatasubramanian (violin) G. Sridhar, Natarajan (flute) R. Babu Rajasekaran, A. Venkatesh, Harish, Erode Nagarajan (mridangam) Sankar, G. Kumar (dolki) Vaghulabharanam (tabla), V. Srinivasan (tambura) are the accompanists who by their unobtrusive playing embellish the bhajans.Pitchumani, K.S. Mallikarjun, Bhriga Balu, D. Aravamudhan, A. Srikkanth, Suresh, Balaji, Sunder, Raghu, Chandran, B.T. Rangarajan, Kumar, Vijay and Shankar Swaminathan effectively give their vocal support in these volumes.An invaluable treasure that should find a place in the music rack of devotees. Such is the compositional value that one attains bliss listening to them, even if the meaning is not understood.  Music students and connoisseurs would find it a very useful source. While the first five volumes are priced Rs.180 each, the rest are priced at Rs. 240 each. Copies can be had from V. Srinivasan (98413 97762) and leading music stores.
