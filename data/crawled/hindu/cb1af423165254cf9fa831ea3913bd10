VP radip Kumar sings (SPVGMC Trust, Mysore) vigorously: in the present instance, the developments tended to be rather aggressive. He dealt with the compositions on a war footing, not sparing even gentle ragas and compositions. The method of developing the ragas did not favour any demonstration of their finer aspects. Importance given to the swarakalpana far exceeded their significance and relevance. Without appropriate voice modulations and restraint over volume, the numbers lost their charm.It is hard to conceive even a remote idea of either presenting the raga Dvijavanti or the corresponding composition &#8220;Akhilandeshwari&#8221; (Dikshitar) fraught with impetuous machismo and overbearing rhythm- patterns. Relying too much on swara jugglery without due considerations to their moods undermined the personality of the raga, belittling the dignity of the composition.The young artiste endowed with remarkable extempore could have mellowed down his voice, filtered labyrinthine articulations and honed his style, with due considerations to the sentiments impregnated in the lyrics and the emotive contents nested in the ragas, ultimately to engender tuneful airs to fall softly on the ears.It was sad that even the mature percussionist, H.S. Sudhindra (mridanga) entered into the fray resorting to noisy thumps. There was not much scope for either the melody accompanist (violin-Charulatha Ramanujam) or the co- percussionist (ghata - G.S. Ramanujan) to exhibit any of their artistry or subtleties.The concert included &#8220;Kalaharanamelara&#8221; (Shudha Saveri-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Vijayambike&#8221; (Vijayanagari -Muthaiah Bhagavathar), &#8220;Shyama Sundaranga&#8221; (Dhanyasi-Thyagaraja) and so on.***In the same venue, M. Balamuralikrishna sang accompanied by Akkarai Subbulakshmi (violin), Nyveli Narayanan (mridanga) and G.S. Ramanujan (mridanga). The young artiste's voice is endowed with force, fluency and gamut, which, when burnished by meticulous grooming and fortified by due considerations to aesthetics, will be able to charge the compositions with the sublime sentiments they warrant.General structure and style of presenting the concert more or less fell into the same cast as the other one discussed earlier. The lyrical sections suffered for lack of sublime emotive aspects. The things appeared more mechanical and technical without pointing at an effort to disseminate that profound sense of devotion and wisdom the great composers emphasised and bequeathed.Unless the main source of the inspiration or the driving force ideally rests on the moods defined in those compositions, whatever may be the embellishments an artiste imaginatively endeavours to realise, they fail to take any definite lasting shape.He was remarkably quick at delineating the morphological shades of the ragas; but any perceptible attempt at investigating into their inner self, remained quite far. Clapping the hand to keep an account of the tala was annoying. Scholarship confined itself mainly to intricate bhirkas and beat-patterns &#8212; of course, instantly drawing one's attention; nevertheless, it did not take into account sweetness and subtleties of the ragas and the lyrics.&#8220;Nemavillada Homa&#8221; (Purvikalyani-Kanakadasa-featuring detailed alapana, neraval and swaraprastara) and &#8220;Kaligiyunte&#8221; (Keeravani-Thyagaraja-the focus of the concert) are some of the examples in support of the above observations.Other presentations were &#8220;Vallabhanayakasya&#8221; (Begade-Dikshithar), &#8220;Anupamagunambudhi&#8221; (Atana-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Manavyalakinchara&#8221; (Nalinakanti-Thyagaraja) and so on.
