VHailing from Bellary in Karnataka, Venkatesh Kumar is a disciple of Pt. Puttraj Gawaii learning under the Gurukul system in Ghadak in Karnatka which has produced some extra-ordinary singers.Recipient of the Sawaii Ghandharva Award, the D.V.Puluskar Award, Swarashri, Sangeet Ratna and the Sangeet Sudha Award, to name a few, Venkatesh Kumar projects a detachment and commitment which are a rare combination in the music world. A follower of the Kirana and the Gwalior styles he has created a niche for himself with his deep resonant voice and perfect gayaki.Relaxed and sauve, Venkatesh Kumar began his recital in raga Poorya Kalyan which has komal &#8216;re,&#8217; all the rest being shudh swaras.  Adhering to the Kirana style in delineating the piece in vilambit, he presented it with bols and the swaras.He has a highly cultured and tayyar voice and in the brief slot  allotted to him he brought out the intricacies of the raga presenting a whole gamut of gamakas and variations in alaap and tans. The piece in dhrut rested more on the Gwalior style where the aesthetics were maintained by balancing the melody with the rhythm and subtleties in swara patterns.A Thumri in Mishr Kafi was equally refreshing. Jab se shaam seedhaare was a Bol banao Thumri and was presented with great flair and artistic acumen.A madhya laya composition in Sohni, &#8216;Kahe karat mose ras kanhaiya,&#8217; brought out the lyrical charm and the religious poignancy unsurpassed even in best of the renditions. U. Karpor on the tabla and Katotee on the harmonium gave tremendous support.Ustad Zakir Hussain&#8217;s preoccupation with divinity was fascinating. He attributed all his innovations to Lord Siva who, with his Dumroo, had gifted the tabla to this world. Equally aware of Hazrat Amir Khusro&#8217;s contribution in conceiving the tabla, he spoke about Ganga and Brahma revealing that he was always conscious of this supra-reality.The Ustad acknowledged the contribution of his co-performers to  his achievements. Each concert, whether it was with Shahid Parvez or with Pt. Shiv Kumar Sharma, left a few &#8220;memory sparks &#8212; chain of ideas.&#8221; &#8220;There are 360 rhythm patterns but  only eight or ten are really popular, so where&#8217;s the question of formulating new ones?&#8221; he said.And it was a mesmerising performance that the Ustad offered,  beginning with Peshkaar which introduces the rhythm in a cycle to the listeners.To the basic assigned cycle more and more was added and combination of themes and variations were shown in a highly stylised and spirited manner.The tabla both  thundered and whispered never losing sight of the nuances.   Certain word patterns  such as Radha, Krishna, Brahma and Vichitre were demonstrated.The Ustad delineated a conversation between an estranged couple, much  to the  amusement of the audience.  Accompanying Zakir Hussian on the Harmonium was maestro Ajay Joglekar.
