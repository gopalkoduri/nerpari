VHe might be only 25 years old. But the maturity he displayed during his vocal concert &#8212; whether in rendering the compositions or while handling the improvisation techniques &#8212; spoke highly of his talents, seen only in seasoned artistes. Kunnakkudi M. Balamuralikrishna, presently under the tutelage of P. S. Narayanaswami, enthralled the Delhi audience during his recital for close to three hours under the aegis of the re-launched Ramakrishnapuram South Indian Society. Balamuralikrishna began learning Carnatic music from his father Meenakshi Sundaram. He has also learnt from Neyveli Santhanagopalan and Sri V. Sundaresan.Even Balamurali's piece, an Adi tala varnam in raga Begada that he presented in two speeds with kalpanaswaras suffixed to it, had considerable depth. The invocation song to Lord Vinayaka was Muttuswami Dikshitar's &#8220;Siddhi Vinayakam&#8221; in raga Shanmukhapriya. Here again, the kalpanaswaras that he appended flowed with rich creativity.Formed in the year 1963 to bring together people, particularly the South Indian residents of New Delhi's R K Puram and nearby areas, through cultural and other activities, Ramakrishnapuram South Indian Society went into hibernation in 1995 due to the transfer and subsequent shifting of its founder members. With active interest taken by some of the old functionaries, the organisation is now back in action. The Society in its rejuvenated form has plans to cater not only to the R K Puram area but also to the entire National Capital Region.Since Tyagaraja Aradhana Day was round the corner, Balamurali thought it fitting to take up as many compositions as possible of the legendry saint-composer. He took up &#8220;Sambho Mahadeva&#8221; in raga Pantuvarali and &#8220;Kaddanuvariki&#8221; in raga Todi for detailed presentations. In his elaborate delineation, Balamurali brought the features of these ragas to the fore. His creative talents were further accentuated when he handled the neraval of the phrase &#8220;Sambho Mahadeva&#8221; and subsequent swaraprastaras. In the Todi composition, improvisation was in the form of swaraprastaras only. The other two Tyagaraja's compositions, &#8220;Nannu brova&#8221; in raga Abhogi and &#8220;Yochana kamala lochana&#8221; in raga Darbar too were very impressively presented.Balamurali's post tani-avartanam session was also a lively one. He packed the session with some emotive songs like &#8220;Jagadodaraka&#8221;, &#8220;Idadhu padam thukki adum&#8221;, &#8220;Ramanai tharuvai&#8221; and a tillana.Chennai-based Kalyani Shankar on the violin and Delhi's K.N. Padmanabhan provided excellent support to Balamurali. The perfect understanding that spontaneously emerged amongst the trio and the team spirit that they displayed was another striking feature of the concert. Kalyani's sketch of Pantuvarali and Todi was delightful. Padmanabhan, who is increasingly becoming a dependable percussion accompanist for the visiting artistes here, played an enjoyable tani avartanam in Adi tala.Another noteworthy feature, which other organisations in the Capital should emulate, is the way the re-launch function was held. It began at the scheduled time. The function which preceded the concert was over in a flash. In a couple of minutes, the president of the society, S. Rajaram, traced the history of the organisation, why it is being activated again and plans for the future. The address of the chief guest Justice K. Ramamoorthy and the vote of thanks by the secretary, S. Krishnaswamy, too were brief and to the point. On the whole, an enjoyable winter evening in the Capital that will remain long in one's memory.
