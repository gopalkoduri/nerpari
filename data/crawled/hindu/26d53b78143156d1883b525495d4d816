VShe pointed out  that since not more than 300 compositions of MDR are available with notations in his own handwriting,  she would not want to take liberties with the music as the other compositions have only the literature and ragas prescribed for them.Sowmya started her concert with a varnam in Manirang. She included compositions of MDR, and those of other composers that  MDR immortalised with his stamp.One such song was the Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Palukavemira&#8217; in raga Poornachandrika. Sowmya remembered how she was taught a unique chittaswaram for this piece with &#8216;vishesha prayogas;&#8217; she sang a different one at the end of the charanam, one taught by her own guru S. Ramanathan.&#8216;Hariyum Haranum onre endru&#8217; in Atana raga  had twisted sangatis and special jhanda subtleties in the alaapana. Sowmya apologised to the rasikas for referring  her  notebook as she  &#8220;could not memorise many of the compositions but had internalised them.&#8221;Another MDR masterpiece, &#8216;Divakaratanujam,&#8217; a Vaarakriti by Dikshitar, was presented neatly.The Chakravaakam alaapana, although filled with bhava,  was  correctly pitched,  with the vocalist  touching the low rishabham with ease. MDR&#8217;s command over Telugu was apparent in the kriti &#8216;Neepadamula neranammithi,&#8217; which Sowmya sang.  This was set in jhampa tala.Avaneeswaram Vinu ably  supported the vocalist on the violin.  His  professionalism was evident  as he comprehensively presented the alaapana without overdoing it even a bit.&#8216;Tyagaraja Ashtotharam,&#8217; MDR&#8217;s obeisance to Tyagaraja, which he composed in eight ragas,  was sung with special usages and chittaswaras.  Sama raga is followed by Bilahari, Kundalavarali and other ragas.It was indeed a delight to hear the less popular songs of MDR; otherwise the maestro is better remembered for his &#8216;Sagarashayanavibho&#8217; or &#8216;Tyagarajagurumashraye.&#8217;A vilamba kala rendition of Bhairavi swarajathi was well supported by Neyveli Narayanan on the mridangam, especially at the points of vishranti (deep pauses) in Mishrachappu. He did a fair job on the thaniyavarthanam as well. Another sparkler was the Sindhubhairavi piece &#8216;Maname Diname antha Ramanin.&#8217;&#8216;Rama Rama&#8217; in Neelambari concluded the concert,  which was yet another effort to relive the musical magic of  MDR.
