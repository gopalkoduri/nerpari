VA beacon of Sree Satyananda Devayatan, Archana Puri Maa defines the term versatility. A vocalist, writer, poet, lyricist, music composer and elocutionist&#8230;there are many ways to describe her. Under her tender care the blissful &#8216;Sur-yog&#82;\u000a17;, the easiest yet highest form of worship envisaged by her guru Sree Thakur Satyananda, continues to magnetise sensitive souls.The temple of music and literature, tucked away in the southern fringes of Kolkata, wore a festive look to celebrate the 80th birthday  of Maa. That the magnetism of her quiet personality commands veneration was evident from the inspired homage offered by numerous devoted practitioners of varied art forms during the colourful cultural event spread over six days.One evening  was solely committed to Pandit Arun Bhaduri. The renowned vocalist poured his heart out in Shuddh Kalyan. The short aochar (introductory phrase) deftly revealed the contemplative mood of this heavy raga. The lyrics of the slow Ek tala bandish &#8220;Karam karo Kripal Dayal&#8221; peaked in piety when rendered with the help of emotive meends (glides) during the serene badhat (elaboration). Even the sargam (sol-fa) was treated in the same fashion. Heavy gamak-taan followed by lightening taans ushered in the Teen tala composition laced with short, crisp taans.He then rendered a seasonal Gaud Malhar with its lovely meandering gait and skilfully decked up compositions in medium-paced Teen tala and fast Ek tala. This was followed by a lilting Mishra Pilu kajri. The concluding bhajan, a favourite of the late A. Kanan, evoked fond memories of the great legendary musician.Veteran tabla accompanist Tarak Saha was very supportive throughout, but young Gourab Chatterjee&#8217;s eager harmonium went a step ahead, at times, to precede the vocalist. Bhaduri accepted the &#8216;trespass&#8217; benevolently.Another evening, slated for poetry reading, elocution and dialogue among litterateurs moderated by well-known poet Ashis Sanyal, saw the eminent elocutionist-couple of Gouri Ghosh and Partho Ghosh deliver a few poems penned by Maa. Their soul-stirring rendition, dotted with their nostalgic reminiscences of Sree Thakur and Maa in her prime, cast a spell. They concluded with their immensely popular &#8220;Karna-Kunti Samvad&#8221;. Once the mood was set, many read their own poems while others recited Maa&#8217;s poems.The final day began with an impromptu guru vandana by none other than Vidushi Girija Devi &#8212; a rare experience for all present. Gourimayi Puri invoked the Mother&#8217;s blessings with an emotive song accompanied by Swami Gadadharananda on the tabla. The evening, however, was chalked out to stage a part of &#8220;Ritu-ranga&#8221; in the format of a dance drama.Written and composed by Maa, it was beautifully choreographed by Odissi exponent Sudha Dutta for this occasion. She relied on live music &#8212; a  delightful departure from the present trend of recorded background score. The soulful songs, portraying some auspicious days during summer and rains, came alive through the well defined movements of the dancers. Chandra Ghosh stood out during her portrayals of Krishna, Kali and the devotion-drenched invocation &#8220;Archana-pranati&#8221;.
