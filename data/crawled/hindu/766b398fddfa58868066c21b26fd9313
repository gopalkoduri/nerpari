VS. SIVAKUMARSyama Sastry&#8217;s kritis have a unique cerebral quality that can be imbibed only through repetitive listening and singing. Malavika, Tanya Nandakumar and Vasupradha, as they rendered the kritis made an emphatic statement that their learning (patan\u000athara) &#8212; proper learning &#8212; was from an expert with profound musical sense and commitment. They began with the varnam in Begada and then as &#8216;Devi Brova&#8217; (Chinthamani) was sung, the plea of the composer could be &#8220;heard,&#8221; especially in the less sung second charanam, &#8216;Repu Mapani Jeppithe Ne Vinanau Ika Thaalanu Nenu&#8217; (I will not listen to any postponement and cannot bear it any further).&#8216;Durusuga&#8217; (Saveri) and &#8216;Mayamma&#8217; (Nattakurinji) followed. The choice then fell on the Swarajathi in Thodi. The rendering was copybook in sangatis and content. Still, more thought should have gone into  the wisdom of the simultaneous rendering in the lower and upper registers. (Vasupradha singing  at the higher octave while the other two at the lower). &#8216;Brovavamma&#8217; (Maanji), &#8216;Karunajoodavamma&#8217; (Varali) and &#8216;Palimsu Kamakshi&#8217; (Madhyamavati) included in the fare were sung with conviction and clarity. Gokul on the violin and Ganapathiraman on the mridangam accompanied faithfully.The ebullience and bubbling effervescence of youth, fine and easy blowing, perfect sruti alignment, immense creative potential, bold and successful laya experimentation from the word go &#8212; all these  were found in the flute concert of Jayanth &#8212; a plentiful resource at the age of 15. The charanam in Mohana varnam was extraordinarily rendered in multiple kalams with the kalpanaswaras also on an equal footing.The Jathiswaram, Pa Ma Ga Ma Ri Ga Ma, in &#8216;Sri Maha Ganapathi&#8217; (Gowlai-Dikshitar) was well utilised giving it all the palatable twists and twirls. &#8216;Manavylakinchara&#8217; (Nalinakanthi-Tyagaraja) and &#8216;Tholinenu&#8217; (Kokiladhwani-Tyagaraja) began at a leisurely pace and yet the charanams were given needless impetus. &#8216;Thathvameruga Tharama&#8217; (Garudadhwani-Tyagaraja) had the flautist exhaust gleefully the various possibilities of swaras for the short Rupaka tala.The Kalyani alapana (&#8216;Himadrisuthe,&#8217; Syama Sastry) had a flourish of glittering phrases but an orderly structuring was found wanting. A Ragam Tanam Pallavi in Kapi, with swaras in Behag, Subha Panthuvarali and Durbari fulfilled the &#8220;desiya&#8221; segment of the concert.Two javalis in Chenchuruti (Sakhiprana) and Khamas (Apadhooruku) served to substantiate the flautist&#8217;s wide canvas.The concert ended with a tillana in Mohanakalyani and a Tiruppugazh. Kandadevi Vijayaraghavan on the violin accompanied with  concern and attention guiding the youngster giving  alapanas studded with standardised phrases. Ganapathiraman (mridangam) and Guruprasad (ghatam) gave a pulsating thani glowing with well worked-out korvais and accompanied with gusto.Both the concerts were organised by Anna Nagar Music Circle Trust in association with Sri Sadguru Sangeetha Vidyalaya.Bottom Template Starts
