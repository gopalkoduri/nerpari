VIt was a trip down memory lane during the flute recital of Sangeetha Kalanidhi on February 4 at Keyes High school. N. Ramani, played  at the inaugural concert at the 10th cultural festival of Sri Chandrasekharendra Sangeetha Educational Society. It turned out be a concert lesson by the veteran artiste for the youngsters .The maestro was at his best.He  started off withGirirajasudhain Bangala. Briskly moving toGurulekain Gowrimanohari. Only a few songs elicit such emotional response asEndaro Mahanubhavuludoes. As he started his famousPancharatna, the audience couldn&#8217;t stop  singing along.  Ramani  rendered the song in a beautiful manner,  while playing theswarasand Varadarajan on the violin playing thesahityas.Soon  Ramani picked upBegada, affectionately called theMeegadaof Carnatic music.  Though fast,Begadais a beautiful raga. The maestro playedNaadopasanathe majestickritiof Thyagaraja at an optimum pace and ended it without anykalpana swara. The spiralling phrases which Ramani played in the elaboratealaapanaof Shankmukhapriya, that came next, was thrilling. It brought back memories of  &#8216;veena-venu-violin&#8217; concerts. Varadarajan on the violin played a competent Shanmukhapriya.Andavane, of Papanasam Sivan was thekritichosen by Ramani. It ended with an aptkalpana swara.Ramani then performed his  evergreen favourite &#8211;Mohanam. He played  thisragain its totality.Mohana Ramathe grandkritiof Thyagaraja was dealt in detail. Varadarajan did a great job in faithfully following the flautist both in spirit and grammar. Theswarapatterns that followed were rich in the essence of the raga. Neyveli Venkatesh and Tiruchy Murali played a brisk and brilliantthani. Thenadaipart of thethanideserves special mention.A nostalgic concert of this kind withoutBindumaliniis unthinkable. He also played his other favourites likeMokshamu(Saramathi) andNaanati Brathuku(Revathi).
