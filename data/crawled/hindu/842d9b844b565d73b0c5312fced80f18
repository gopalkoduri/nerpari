VThe weeklong Sri Ramanavami Music Festival of Mysore concluded at the Bidaram Sri Ramamandira with the vocal concert of M.R. Sudha Raviprakash. Bestowed with melodious tonal resonance, the artiste's style of presentation was pleasant with a good selection of raga and impressive compositions rendered with the accurate diction. Alapana in raga Bhairavi (one of the poignant ragas of Carnatic Music) with the composition of Sri Tyagaraja's "Upacharamu" was well delineated.  Nevertheless, the artiste's efforts to bring the beauty of this raktiraga in the neraval of the charana sahitya "Kapata Nataka Sutradarivai" was impressive. "Brovabaharama" in raga Bahudari, "Marugelara" in raga Jayanthasri and the Hamsadhwani composition of GNB "Varavallaba Ramana Vigna Harana" were good selections for the concert. The notable part of the concert was the excellent combination of the mridanga (Jayachandra Rao) and ghatam (Sukanya) who stole the show. Violin by Palghat Swaminathan was supportive to the concert.The concert of Brinda N. Rao under the aegis of Ganabharathi at Veene Seshanna Bhavana was inspiring. Rendition of selected compositions in vilambakala was appreciable. "Kamakshi Amba", Shyama Shastri's masterly svarijithe in Bhairavi elevated the concert.Concise alapana coupled with adequate emotion and technical excellence were the hallmarks of the concert. In her well-trained voice she rendered "Bhavaye Gopala Balam" and "Parthasarathe Nanu Palimpa Rada" were rendered with great virtuosity. Veena Suresh on violin and P. Nataraja on the mridanga gave adequate support.B.S.S. RAOBottom Template Starts
