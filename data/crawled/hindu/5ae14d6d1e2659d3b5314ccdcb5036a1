V"Sufism is for purifying\u000aone's soul. It is not for\u000aworldly people, it is about\u000atranscending the mortal pleasures\u000aand falling in love with\u000aGod," says Sufi singer Anita\u000aSinghvi.Anita, who has crossed the\u000abenchmark of 200 concerts in\u000aIndia and overseas, has just\u000acome up with her fourth album,\u000aTajalli. "Tajalli", which\u000ameans a ray of light, has eight\u000atracks and is produced by\u000aHMV SaReGaMa. "These are\u000atraditional sufiana kalaams\u000aby the likes of Hazrat Amir\u000aKhusrao and Arif Khairabadi,\u000aI have composed them in traditional\u000asufi style," says Anita.\u000a"I dedicate this album to my\u000aguru Anjali Banerjee who\u000agave me hours and hours of\u000ataleem. I have tried to maintain\u000athe essence of Sufism as\u000amuch as possible," she adds.Anita has been learning\u000amusic since the age of seven\u000aunder the guidance of Pandit\u000aKshir Sagar. Thereafter, she\u000apursued the Visharad course\u000aat the Bhatkhande Sangeet\u000aInstitute, Delhi. She has had\u000aguidance from Mujahid Hussain\u000aKhan Saheb of the Rampur\u000aSehaswan gharana,\u000aShanti Hiranand, Anjali Banerjee\u000aand Begum Muneer\u000aKhatoon of Allahabad. "Years\u000aof riyaaz is the least of an offering\u000aI could pay to sufism.\u000aSufism is the quest for perfection,\u000aand through this questone\u000ainches closer to\u000aKhuda."With fast-paced music enveloping\u000apopular culture,\u000aand many youngsters falling\u000afor it, Anita remarks, "Today's\u000ayouth want everything\u000aat their own pace. Sufi music\u000ais not something you can\u000aenjoy on your i-pod while\u000atravelling in the Metro. Sufism\u000arequires a mood, one\u000amust seek purification to be\u000aable to recognise the bliss\u000athat sufi shayri offers. In\u000afact, if a ghazal or a sufiana\u000akalaam is sung in an appropriate\u000aenvironment in the\u000atraditional way, it is not possible\u000ato not enjoy it. Sufi is\u000aroohani sangeet, and appeals\u000adirectly to the soul."She adds, "Bollywood music\u000ais business, and business\u000aand Sufi music do not go\u000atogether. Mediocrity has become\u000athe norm, whereas Sufism\u000ais the quest for\u000aperfection. They are opposite\u000apoles. It is my prayer\u000athat the culture of Sufi music\u000ais spread among the youth,\u000aand my album is just a small\u000aeffort in that direction." She\u000aculminates saying, "Sufism is\u000aGod's message to mankind.\u000aEvery soul must accept it."\u000aAt the album's launch function\u000aheld in New Delhi's The\u000aLalit hotel, Anita regaled\u000athose present with some of\u000aher latest Sufi compositions.
