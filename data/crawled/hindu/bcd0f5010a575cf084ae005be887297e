VV. BALASUBRAMANIANExclusive abhang concerts by Carnatic musicians, which was hitherto the forte of the Bhagavatars of the namasankeertana tradition, is catching upslowly.  Pushpa Anand presented one such recital for the Nungambakkam Seva Samajam Trust at its hall.The programme on Saturday coincided with their weekly bhajan day.In keeping with the mood was the imposing Thanjavur painting of Radha-Krishna on a swing,  vinyl portraits of Lord Panduranga, his Consort Rukmayee and devotees.Pushpa commenced with a Narayana namavali which was followed by "Vittala Ye Rae" (Janardhan Swamy) in folk melody. The hall was packed by the time "Abhiragulaala" (Tsokaamhane-Mohanam) was completed. And Pushpa, a regular at the bhajan sessions of Swami Haridoss Giri, mesmerised the listeners with her rendering.The crowd, hands clapping, went into ecstasy as it joined Pushpa in her chant, "Vittala Vittala." And this became a regular with every abhang and namavali rendered by her."Chidananda Roopa" (Gyaneshwar-Maand) and "Amuchaa Achara" (Nivruttti-Shanmukhapriya) were soaked in devotion and so was the audience.The abhangs were interspersed with well-known namavalis.  "Vrindavani Venu" (Bhanudasar-Bhimplas) had a lot of light touches, nevertheless, it was enjoyable.Bright voiceWith a voice that carried easily across the hall, one wondered why Pushpa preferred to have a sound system with blaring speakers. In fact a mikeless concert would have been soothing and suited the spirit of the recital.Ever smiling Muthuswamy Bhagavatar (son of popular harmonium vidwan Muthu Natesa Bhagavatar) was superb on the harmonium.His nimble fingers dancing and jumping on the keys produced lovely spuritams and meditative straight notes. Manikandan (mridangam) and Saketharaman (dolki) were the mainstay with their varied rhythmic patterns. Pranesh was quite competent in his vocal support.Bottom Template Starts
