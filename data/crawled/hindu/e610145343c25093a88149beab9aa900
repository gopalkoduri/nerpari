VEndowed with a resonant saareeram, R. Suryaprakash, a disciple of T. V. Sankaranarayanan adheres to his guru's bani and mannerisms with great fidelity. He will do well to develop his own  style of presentation. Though he revealed the depth of his musical instincts in the raga alapanas and songs, his tendency to imitate his mentor and the late Madurai Mani Iyer was pronounced. A confident delivery and crisp presentation of his musical wares marked his recital held at Coimbatore under the aegis of Alapana last week.Commencing with the Bhairavi varnam - Viribhoni - he set a hearty pace with "Sri Raghukula" (Hamsadhwani) and "Evarini" (Devamritavarshini).  His raga delineation of Lathangi for the kriti, "Venkataramana" and Useni for "Sree Kalahasti," one of the Panchalinga kshetra kritis of Dikshitar were aesthetically pleasing.  His Khambodi alapana for "Thiruvadi Charanam" followed by a neat neraval and kalpanaswaras with appropriate korvais lent the kriti much dignity.Pakala Ramadas, (violin), scored high on the scale of melody with deft bowing and imaginative phrasings. Balaji on the mridangam and Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam created an emphatic impact in the percussive wing.T. K. GANAPATHYBottom Template Starts
