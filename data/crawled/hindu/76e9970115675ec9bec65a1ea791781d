VLALITHAA KRISHNANIt was a concert with a difference. Conceptualised by T.S. Parthasarathy and built exclusively around padams and javalis, Geetha Raja and Subhashini Parthasarathy drew from a wide repertoire that reflected their tutelage under Brinda and Muktha, in their concert for the Sarvani Sangeetha Sabha.They were accompanied by Usha Rajagopal on the violin, T.R.Murthy on the flute and Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar on the mridangam. The artistes held the attention of a large audience by making the most of contrasting elements in kalapramana, tala and choice of raga.Several rare compositions were sourced from the works of Dharmapuri Subbarayar, Pattabhiramayya, Govindasamayya, Muddu Natesa, Ghanam Krishna Iyer, Patnam Subramania Iyer, Tirupati Vidyala Narayanaswami and Kshetragnya. A short instrumental prelude also added to the flavour of the compositions.Most compositions were rendered solo by each artiste in turn, while a few were sung by both. Geetha Raja's renditions included Pattabhiramayya's javali, `Nee maatale maayanura' in Poorvikalyani which held a note of wry humour, with the nayaki describing the nayaka's promises to bring a different jewel on three separate occasions &#151;  with nothing materialising in the end.Nayaka's sentimentsMuddu Natesa's padam in Mukhari, `Ososi naamadhi' conveyed, for a change, the nayaka's sentiments, bemoaning the harsh reality of his paramour forsaking him, thus giving him no option but to leave for Kasi.Dharmapuri Subbarayar's javali `Smarasundaraanguni' in Paras was sung with a blend of gusto and modulated niceties.The lyrics of Ghanam Krishnaiyer's Tamil padam, `Thiruvotriyur Thyagarajan' in Atana conveyed the nayaki's wish for union with the Divine.Subhashini Parthasarathy handled the brisk javali `Alavani Nammaradhe' (Anandabhairavi), `Naarimani' (Khamas) and `Vagaladi' (Behaag) with finesse.But it was in the slow-paced Govindasamayya padam, `Maaname bhooshanamu' that she truly proved her mettle, with the composition weaving through the serene walkways of Sankarabharanam to create a sense of pervasive calm.`Meragaadhu' also stood testimony to her intensive training, the unhurried kalapramana extracting the essence.As their strong voices rose in unison, the Kshetragnya padam, `Aiyayyo vegatayene' (here modified to `Ammamma') proved a splendid example of the practice of commencing with the anupallavi in the higher reaches in order to achieve an impressive opening and then moving on to the more self-effacing pallavi. The sombre tones of Punnagavarali were particularly effective in conveying the sadness arising from the growing rift between the nayaki and her beloved. Other compositions included the javalis of Dharmapuri Subbarayar, `Praanasakhuditu' in Senchuruti and `Adi neepai' in Yamunakalyani. The rarely heard Tamil padam of Ghanam Krishna Iyer, `Nithirayil', was a reverie-laden delight.Usha Rajagopal impressed with her concise sketch of Sankarabharanam, while T.R.Murthy's Pantuvarali prelude drew much appreciation. Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar's playing was non-obtrusive and reinforced the feel of each composition.Bottom Template Starts
