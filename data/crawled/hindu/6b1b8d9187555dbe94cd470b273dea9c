While her disciples O.N.S. Saileswari and B. Uma Savitri sang the lyrical part in tandem with her, Pantula Rama on violin and G. Venkata Rao on mridangam lent fortifying support.The devout delineation of ragas, `Kedaragoula' forParakela Nannuparipaalimpa, `Madhyamavathi' for expansive expatiation ofPaalinchu Kamakshiand `Shanmukhapriya' expansively followed by exquisitely coined `thanam' for the pallavi which she rendered in `Khandatriputa' and concluded it with commensurable `swarakalpana', in particular carried the mood into realms bordering ecstasy.The repertoire for the evening also had Bhairavi Atatalavarnam with which she got off to a soulful start,Ekadanthambhaje(Bilahari) prefixed with a brief but beautiful aalapana,Chinnanade(Kalanidhi),Koluvaiyunnade(Arabhi) and a sloka in `Ragamalika' followed byYare Ranganawhich provided a grand finale.A.R.S.Bottom Template Starts
