VTrichur Ramachandran, in his concert to mark G.N. Balasubramaniam's (GNB) centenary year, narrated anecdotes and salient features of the maestro's music whilst rendering a couple of his guru's compositions.Ramachandran began the musical tribute with GNB's varnam in raga Hindolam. He demonstrated GNB's penchant for swara singing at odd spots, by singing swaras for the eduppu &#8216;Parvathi sukumara' in the composition &#8216;Swaminatha paripalaya' in raga Natta.GNB also was the proponent of rare ragas and kritis of the Trinity, including ragas Chenchukamboji and Andolika. Keeping this in mind, Ramachandran presented &#8216;Kanananerchina' in raga Deepakam in Adi tala.The concert was also held as a tribute to composer Syama Sastri. As Syama Sastri is not part of the regular repertoire of the GNB bani, Ramachandran had to resort to the &#8216;notebook' to sing the Bhairavi swarajathi &#8216;Kamakshi amba.'Ramachandran presented &#8216;Ranjani Niranjani' in raga Ranjani with a short raga sketch and varied swara endings. Fast and packed swaras were the feature of the Bahudari raga kriti &#8216;Unnadiye gathi ennadainthen.'Syama Sastri's kriti in Tamil &#8216;Tarunameedamma' in Gauli Pantu raga was sung with verve. During the concert, the vocalist explained how a raga such as Kanada, which mainly focusses on the lower notes, was given a different treatment in the high notes by GNB when he composed &#8216;Paramukhamelanamma.'Focus on bhavaThis cannot be found in kritis like &#8216;Sukhiyavvaro' and &#8216;Mamavasada janani,' which are in the same raga. The artiste presented the song with due focus on the bhava and gamakas. He again spoke of GNB's fondness for a rare raga called Malavi. &#8216;Mariveregathi nakevaru' was the kriti presented.Bangalore Praveen gave perfect support on the mridangam, playing with &#8216;sowkhyam.' He gave a display of his mastery in the short tani that followed.Ramachandran presented &#8216;Mayamma' in Ahiri raga, a composition of Syama Sastri. His elaboration of Kalyani was fast paced with moderate briga works.&#8216;Himadrisuthe pahimam' had a decent niraval.Violinist V.V. Ravi's delineation of the raga was melodic and bhava laden. &#8216;Ninnu pogada tharama' in Kundalavarali and &#8216;Radha sametha krishna' in Mishra Yaman were the closing pieces. The event was organised by Kerala Fine Arts Society.
