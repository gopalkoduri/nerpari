VIt was delectable music by mostly young masters at the 13th Annual L.V. Memorial Concerts, conducted by the Rasika Ranjana Sabha recently. The programme, held at the Sabha's FGN Hall, Tiruchi, was spread over 11 days and was a boon for music lovers.The festival had a rousing start with Padma Sugavanam (vocal), who was accompanied by Venkatasubramanian on the violin and Ananthakrishnan on the mridangam.Audience enthralledThe mellifluous voice of K. Jyotsna enthralled the audience as she sang &#8216;Karunai Sheivan' (Sri), &#8216;Ninnu Vina' (Varali) and &#8216;Nee Iranga' (Atana). She was accompanied by G.Venkatasubramanian on the violin and S. J. Arjun Ganesh on the mridangam.The U.S. based engineer, Ramakrishna Murthy, delighted the rasikas by tackling Mukhari (&#8216;Sivakamasundari'), &#8216;Subramanya' (Hindolam) and &#8216;Ankaranamaka' (Kapi) in his inimitable style on the third day. He was accompanied by Nagai Sriram on the violin and Ganapathiraman on the mridangam.The doyen, &#8216;Tiruchi' Ganesan with &#8216;Ambalapuzha' Pradeep on the violin, &#8216;Palladam' Ravi on the mridangam and Rajaganesh on the kanjira gave a recital in his established style. Special mention must be made about the thani performed by the percussion trio.The young executive from New Delhi, Mohan Santhanam, who took up popular ragas, gave an astounding performance. He was ably supported by N. C. Madhav on the violin, Salem Srinivasan on the mridangam and Murali on the ghatam. His &#8216;Mahaganapathim' (Thodi), &#8216;Kanagasabapathikku' (Atana) and &#8216;Marukelara' (Jayanthsri) will be remembered for a long time by the audience.

Elaborating in Mohanam (&#8216;Ra Ra Rajeevalochana') with apt swaras, she delved deep into Varali (&#8216;Gopalanatha'). Her Poorvikalyani (&#8216;Intha Paramugam Enaiya') and Sama (&#8216;Annapurne') spoke volumes of her mastery and it seemed that she relived MS that day. N. C. Madhav on the violin, Sivakumar on the mridangam and Renganathan on the ghatam gave her able support.Two comedies were also staged. &#8216;VRS O VRS,' presented by Chennai Kala Nilayam, was directed by K.
