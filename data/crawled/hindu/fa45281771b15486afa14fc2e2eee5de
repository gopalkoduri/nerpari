VThere can be a little or no disagreement that Kolkata grooms in its `cottage industry' of guru-shishya parampara almost three fourth's of the high quality musicians in the contemporary scenario of Hindustani music, with a pronounced emphasis on the different instrumental styles.Melody of Strings, a two-day festival dedicated to the memory of violinist Mily Bose, was sponsored by the London Sitar Ensemble U.K. and organised by Navratna, Kolkata. The festival, which was entirely focussed on instrumentalists,featured the upcoming sarod exponent Surranjan Mukharjee, who played Miyan Ki Malhar.He displayed fine mood, sur and tala and was very soothing in his approach. He is technically sound but has to further improve his total presentation. His recital was complemented by the expert fingers of the senior tabla player Sumantra Guha.Masterly recitalThe first day's session came to its pinnacle with a masterly sitar recital by the Maihar gharana sitar exponent Pandit Sanjay Guha, known for reviving old traditional bandishes with a blend of his imagination. He played the raga Jogkauns and a rare bandish in Meera Bai ki Malhar.With instrumentalists like Sanjay Guha performing frequently one can hope that great traditional bandishes will be preserved and not die out from neglect.The second day's session featured Indrayudh Bose painting the curves of raga Shree, followed by the more aggressive mood of Durga.Indrayudh is a dedicated and talented violinist broadly following the mode of Shisher Kanadhar Chaudhary and his own guru mata, the late Mily Bose. Pandit Kaushal Das's magnificent sitar recital in Kausi Kanhra provided the grand finale to the festival. Kaushal's alap, jod and jhala had shades of all great instrumentalists, yet he had invented some innovative paths of his own.He  was ably accompanied on the tabla by the much talked of Shubhyankar Banerjee. Kaushal Das compels one to admire his capability of advancing his baaj even at this mature stage, thus creating the possibility to join the galaxy of greats in his tradition.KAVITA SHUKLABottom Template Starts
