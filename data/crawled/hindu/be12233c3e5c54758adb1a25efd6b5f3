VS. Sowmya's was the first concert in Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha's recently concluded Thyagaraja Music Festival. Driven by team spirit, the close to three-hour concert was delightful. She opened with Tyagaraja's &#8220;Sree Ganapatini&#8221; in raga Saurashtra. &#8220;Vandanamu Raghunandana&#8221;, another Tyagaraja composition, in raga Sahana, featured a brief alap in which Sowmya brought out the essence of the raga. The swaraprastaras were lively.Yet another Tyagaraja, kriti, &#8220;Teliyaleru Rama&#8221; in raga Dhenuka was well presented with due attention to the raga's emotive aspects and the lyrics. &#8220;Bantu riti&#8221; in raga Hamsanadam and &#8220;Svararagasudha&#8221; in Shankarabharanam were enthralling. The detailed alap of Shankarabharanam brought out its complete features. She also presented neraval of the phrase &#8220;Raama naama manu vara khadga mivi&#8221; from the former song and &#8220;Muladhara nada merugute&#8221; from the latter composition. The neraval and swaraprastaras were rich in creativity. In addition to Tyagaraja kritis, Sowmya included a few appealing Tamil compositions. R.K. Sreeramkumar (violin), Neyveli Narayanan (mridangam) and B.S. Purushothamon (kanjira) provided understanding support. In particular, Sreeramkumar's sketch of Shankarabharanam was delightful. The percussionists played a lively tani avartanam in Adi tala. On the whole, Sowmya's concert livened up the festivity.Sudha Raghunathan, who sang on the last day, too packed her recital predominantly with Tyagaraja compositions. It was a diverse pack chosen intelligently and contained &#8220;Darini Telusukonti&#8221;, (raga Suddha Saveri), &#8220;Emani pogadudura&#8221; (Viravasantam), &#8220;Mokshamu Galadhaa&#8221; (Saramati) and &#8220;Svararagasudha&#8221; (Shankarabharanam). Sadly, Sudha wasn't at her usual best, and it was a lacklustre performance. The highlight was the unfolding of raga Yamuna Kalyani, through the technique of graha bhedam (or sruti bhedam), while delineating raga Shankarabharanam.B. Raghavendra Rao (violin), Patri Satish Kumar (mridangam) and R. Raman (morsing) provided impressive support to Sudha.Nehru ParkElsewhere, at Nehru Park, U. Srinivas' short mandolin recital during the Music in the Park series, too, disappointed. Srinivas opened with Koteeswara Iyer's &#8220;Varana mukhava&#8221; in raga Hamsadhwani. He suffixed this with crisp swaraprastaras. His central item was Tyagaraja's &#8220;Evvare Ramayya&#8221; in raga Gangeyabhushani. Though Srinivas could bring to the fore the emotive aspects of the raga, he stretched it too much during the alap and swaraprastaras. He finished off with three miscellaneous songs. While V.V. Srinivasa Rao provided good violin support, S. Swaminathan (mridangam) and S. Kannan (morsing) were mediocre.
