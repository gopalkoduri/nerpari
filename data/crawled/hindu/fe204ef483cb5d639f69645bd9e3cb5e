VIf the routes to music appreciation are varied for a connoisseur, the path of realisation is varied for the song-bird too. While music could be a soul-seeking tool for some, for others it could well be an object of comfort. At the two-day Mallikarjun Mansur Festival, organised by the Bangalore Kidney Foundation, listeners who turned up in large numbers, as well as the six performers, each came with a definite purpose, though the binding factor was the love of music.Shruti Sadolikar among the finest singers of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana is deeply passionate about her art as well as its aesthetics. In her, one sees not just a musician who loses her heart to the emotion of the song, but also a scholar who is constantly blending intellect and emotion, a melting and merging. Trained by her father Vaman Rao Sadolikar, Shruti&#8217;s voice has a limited range but she exploits it to the fullest. It is full-bodied, yet mellifluous. The occasional nasal twang lends an old-world charm, a lovely nostalgia to her rendition. &#8220;Rasiya Aavona&#8221;, the vilambit khyal in Maru Behag, was Shruti&#8217;s first presentation. Packed with power, it had creative taans, gamaks and intricate layakari, but failed to stir the soul. Did the self in some way take over her music? But in Kaushi Kanada, a jod raga, special feature of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana, Shruti blossomed. The complex raga which mixes Darbari Kanada and Malkauns, opened with a brief introduction, establishing the course of the raga with its involved nuances. The lovely khyal &#8220;Kholo Maan Re&#8221; unravelled the immense possibilities for a multi-layered exposition. Kaushi Kanada is not just complex in terms of its structure, but also in terms of the emotions it evokes. It was hard to tell when it became Darbari and when Malkauns, only to become each other. The mood changed with the beautiful drut khyal &#8220;Lalan tum bina kauna kare&#8221;. Shruti gave it a whole new dimension by juxtaposing two contrasting emotions &#8211; worldly and spiritual. What emerged was a profound musicalscape.Looked upon as the torch bearer of the Mewati Gharana, Sanjeev Abhyankar, the loved disciple of Pandit Jasraj is a charmer. An affable personality, Abhyankar cast a spell on his fairly big following. Completely conscious of all the goings-on, on and off stage, Abhyankar never forgot to applaud the sound engineer, his tabliya (Ravindra Yavagal) and his harmonium saath (Vyasamurthy Katti). In fact, at times, inspired by the interpretation on the harmonium, he sought to reproduce it the very next instant. Clearly, he wanted his audience to be happy. His rather elaborate Madhuvanti remained unhurried for a good length of the exposition. He worked in the lower registers before he moved on to the madhya sapthak. With a voice that has many limitations, Abhyankar&#8217;s layakari and taans were catchy, though they didn&#8217;t speak of a great imagination.  In the Bhinna Shadaj piece &#8220;Aja huna aaye&#8221;, Abhyankar&#8217;s murchanas changed interpretation with the changing notes.For Jayateertha Mevundi, music appeared as an act of introspection. The intense Mevundi sang Pooriya of a deeply meditative nature. Mevundi didn&#8217;t dazzle with his artistry, but took you along gradually on his contemplative journey. The pace was leisurely, there was a good infusion of ideas, but at some point, probably when he began his bol taans and laykaari, why did one begin to hear Pandit Bhimsen Joshi? Joshi overtook Mevundi, who is regarded as the great hope of Kirana Gharana. It nearly overshadowed his own music. Shahana Kanada came as rescue. The jhaptaal cheez, &#8220;Avaguna bhayo&#8221; was resplendent with musical ideas. The raga, a blend of Adana, Darbari Kanada and Malhar weaves swara patterns that are jagged. Mevundi excelled in his presentation with lovely glissandos, microtonal variations, charming patterns, tracing the rise and fall of the notes.Among other performances was N.V. Gopinath&#8217;s sitar recital, Samaresh Chowdhry&#8217;s and Ajay Pohankar&#8217;s vocal recitals. The star performers were however, Ravindra Yavagal and Vishwanath Nakod on the tabla, Vyasamurthy Katti and Ravindra Katoti on the harmonium.In a festival with so many artistes involved, it seems understanding is possible only when it is inter textual in nature. Music, like all arts, fails even the most accomplished at times. And therefore, discussing a performance just in terms of its merits and demerits seems an incomplete exercise. What probably is of significance is an artistes&#8217; understanding of his music and what it in turn constructs for the listener. One could still argue, to put it in the words of poet Da. Ra. Bendre, &#8220;Leeleyalli Yaavudu Viphalavalla&#8221;.
