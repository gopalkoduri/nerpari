VVocalsRaaga Arts Foundation _ CDTrichur Ramachandran,Charumathi Ramachandran,Shubhashree, Sikkil Gurucharan.The Raaga Foundation compact disc titled, ``Vocals," features Trichur V. Ramachandran, Charumathi Ramachandran, Shubhashree and Sikkil Gurucharan. `Maadhayai' in Vasanta and `Janaki Pathe' in Kharaharapriya have been rendered sweetly by Shubhashree.The viruttam `Oru Tharam Saravana Bhava' in ragas Kedaragowla (Ramachandran), Sahana (Shubashree), Behag (Charumathi) and Shanmukhapriya (Gurucharan) is a melodic experience, followed by `Saravana Bhava' by Sivan in Shanmukhapriya by Shubhasree and Gurucharan. `Adhineepai,' a javali by Dharmapuri Subbarayar in Yamuna Kalyani with the voices of Shubhashree and Gurucharan in perfect harmony, is a total winner.`Yadhavaraaya,' the ragamalika to which M.L. Vasanthakumari had given so much colour and grace, has been rendered by Shubhashree with focus on mellifluent articulation.Swati Tirunal's `Bogeendra Sayinam' in Kuntalavarali with its lilting gait and orchestral prelude, has a spirited swing. Subhashree sings a Tumri, a beautiful genre of Hindustani music with effortless, aesthetic grace. `Radha Samedha Krishna' that had received eclectic, dulcet expression from the maestro G.N. Balasubramaniam, is a sensitive interpretation by Shubhashree.`Enna Thavam Seidanai' in Kapi, by Shubhashree, recorded on a double track to sound like two voices, is enjoyable. GNB's `Mangala Varadayaki' in Kathanakuthoohalam by Charumati and Ramachandran provides quality fare. Patnam Subramania Iyer's Khamas tillana by Gurucharan and Shubhashree, and `Hare Krishna' sung in chorus, conclude the album in style.S. P.Bottom Template Starts
