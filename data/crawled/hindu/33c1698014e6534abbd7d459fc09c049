VPossibly the most defining moment came during the Purvikalyani alapana when pause and articulation, quest and discovery coalesced into a single shining image reflected in the mirror of artistic integrity. For Rama Rao, that integrity has always been best expressed through his music, which takes the form of a tribute to his erstwhile gurus. Having imbibed and internalised the timeless concepts that constitute the bedrock of tradition from stalwarts such as Tiger Varadachar and Mysore Vasudevachar at Kalakshetra where art has always been a way of life, Rama Rao found hisraison d&#8217;etrein his gurukulavasam with Budalur Krishnamurthy Sastri.With intensive sadhana at the feet of a guru who epitomised simple living and high thinking, the sishya was put through his paces in vocal music and gottuvadyam playing.Rama Rao dwelt upon his indebtedness to his guru who had generously bestowed not only knowledge but also much affection upon him.A mellow ambience was established through Tiger Varadachar&#8217;s tana varnam in Sriranjani, the tonal richness of the artiste&#8217;s voice imparting depth to rakthi prayogas.Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Sri Maha Ganapathy Ravathumam&#8217; (Gowla) established a brisk pace.A Devakriya alapana couched in impeccable Carnatic vocabulary in which azhutham went hand in hand with felicitous flow produced striking prayogas softened by melodic graces. Vadi-samvadi combinations added a touch of class to a memorable vignette.Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Sri Guruguha Tarayasumam&#8217; with lilting cadences at &#8216;Hridaya Vibhavitha&#8217; encapsulated sukhabhavam as did limited edition kalapanaswaras short on ado, long on ragabhava. A Supradheepam sketch high in aesthetic content preceded Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Vara Sikivahana&#8217; in which the vocalist &#8216;s admirable commitment to projecting authentic patanthara saw him negotiating upper reach sangathis with perseverance and without compromise, age notwithstanding. Phrases delicately crafted by the hand of experience embellished the Kedaragowla delineation and &#8216;Innamum Orudharam Paarkka Venum&#8217;.The Purvikalyani alapana was a thing of beauty.Showcasing elegance in simplicity and continuity of concept, it was an inner search that touched a chord. Off the cuff variations at the opening line of the anupallavi &#8216;Thanandam Illadha Roopan&#8217; lent added sparkle to Neelakanta Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Anandha Natamaduvar&#8217; in which swaras were all about ragabhava. &#8216;Saravanabhavaguhane&#8217; (Kannada, Papanasam Sivan) provided contrast in pace.Khambodi was defined by majestic pidis and followed up with Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Kana Kan Kodi Vendum.&#8217; The concluding segment unearthed rare nuggets such as Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Purahara Nandana&#8217; (Hamir Kalyani) and Mysore Vasudevachar&#8217;s &#8216;Pranadarthiharam&#8217;  (Senchurutti) and tillana in Natabhairavi. Tiruvarur Balam&#8217;s violin accompaniment struck a rapport with the vocalist&#8217;s interpretations. Thanjavur Subramaniam (mridangam) added punch and enthused through his percussive support.The vainika duo Jaysri and Jeyaraaj merit special mention for having taken the initiative to present K. Rama Rao&#8217;s music to a select, attentive audience in a chamber concert under the auspices of their organisation &#8216;Veenavaadhini&#8217;. This was definitely one concert deserving not just one but several encores, for the benefit of all discerning rasikas.
