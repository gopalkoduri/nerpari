VBalachandra Nakod sings with a virile voice, in a style that is energetic, with progressions well balanced, incorporating all the musical elements required to establish a firm hold over the audience of different understandings and outlook.He was singing under the\u000aauspices of Swarasankula\u000aSangeetha Sabha at Vasudevacharya\u000aBhavana. Veerabhadraiah\u000aHiremath\u000a(harmonium) and Raghavendra\u000aNakod (tabla) accompanied\u000ahim as appropriate\u000asaathis, armed with experience\u000aand imagination equating\u000awith those of the senior\u000asinger.Nevertheless, a certain\u000aamount of pronounced soft\u000avocal inflections would have\u000arendered the developments\u000amelting and soporific, as was\u000aobserved in "Aaj Jaage Mere"\u000asung in Rajeshwari. Setting\u000aaside the deficiencies one\u000amay consider remarkable\u000aabilities and merits, riyaz had\u000afetched him and sadhana has\u000afine-tuned his intuitive expressions.His improvisations evolve\u000awithin a systematic framework,\u000aand the badath is characterised\u000aby artistically and\u000aimaginatively juxtaposed\u000amoods, relevant with both\u000athe rag and the cheez.In this respect, consider\u000aDurga ("Raskanre") and Miyamalhar\u000a("Bolere Papiyara"-\u000aSadarang). He would interpret\u000athe phrases in conformity\u000awith the lyrical import, and\u000adevelop the khyal with composure\u000aand competence, be it\u000aa stage of sthayi or antara.What more one can expect\u000athan smooth glides to nurture\u000athe majesty of Durga and the\u000acharacteristic andolit movements\u000ato evoke the sentiments\u000aof Miyamalhar. The\u000aartiste successfully materialised\u000athe task, and in this process\u000asargams (at time sargam\u000ataans), bolupajs and taans,\u000aenhanced the appeal of developments.Even the sams or the tihayis\u000acomplemented the emotive\u000aaspects rather than turning\u000aout to be mere technical\u000aflashes.Nevertheless, on considering\u000athe nature of the taans, it\u000awas observed that the basic\u000apattern seemed much alike;\u000aand the vivacity and pattern of\u000areaching the climax too remained\u000asimilar. As most of this\u000asection comprised vidyut\u000ataans, there appeared a\u000adearth of taans of other dimensions.Other inclusions were a\u000aKannada abhang ("Panduranga\u000aPandarinatha"), Vachana\u000a("Antharangadalli" -\u000aBasavanna) and "Bolenayi\u000aBole" (Bhairavi).
