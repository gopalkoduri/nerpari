VThe best thing about Saroja Vaidyanathan&#8217;s performance was the rustic demonstration of the beauty of Bharatanatyam. Late comers were allowed  even at  the fag end of the performance.In their collective effort to present the dance recital, &#8216;Siva Sakthi,&#8217;  the troupe made sure the tempo was retained with all vitality. The complexities involved in Bharatanatyam were cut down to basics, making sense to the  audience present at Sri Akilandeshwari Vidyalaya, Tiruchi.The well-rehearsed pieces were harmonised with a crisp prelude. The initial piece, &#8216;Aigiri Nandhini&#8217; set off the pace for the evening. From &#8216;Mahadeva Shambo,&#8217; a Kannada number describing the mythology behind Siva&#8217;s other names &#8212; Gangadara, Bhagiratha, Nanjundeswara, Umamaheswara and Basmasura &#8212; Saroja&#8217;s studied effort and rigorous training of the members of her troupe  were  quite tangible.The bhavas depicting lovelorn Parvati and irate Basmasura were  mature and execution of adavus spoke volumes about her decades of familiarity with the art. The grace and postures in this dance drama weaved in swaranjali, a compilation of ragas that markedly portrayed the troupe&#8217;s strength in choreographic quotient. The tastefully dressed troupe comprising Smita Venkatramani, Swapna Seshadri, Srividvatha, Reshmi Agarwal and Seetha seemed to have acquitted themselves to the perfection of their master.Adi Shankara&#8217;s Siva Panchakshara stotram, &#8216;Nagendra Haraya&#8217; had an elaborate nritta sequence and served as a perfect closing to the day&#8217;s performance.The fast-paced nattuvangam by Lakshmi deserves kudos but the concluding nattuvangam by Kesava Perumal, who had till then feverishly supported  the performance  with mridangam, hogged the entire attention. His high-pitched voice, even as he drummed with perfect percussive skills, added energy to the tillana.  Bhagyalakshmi on the flute added  finesse to the show.
