VB.R.C. IYENGARRecent performances by the flute artiste Jayaprada Ramamurthi &#151;  specially at the 16th Annual Cultural Festival of Sharada Cultural Trust &#151;  show that she is a rising star. She has become more mature, markedly unruffled and opulently unperturbed. The most striking aspect is her doing away with at least a good part of mathematical manoeuvrings inSwarakalpana, which is a dispensable parasite. She takes care to see that she doesn't make departures from the modes that have become sacred tradition and yet retains rich substance as well as delectable charm; the structure is also classic. She played just about half a dozen items and each had its dainty content, compression of expression and fertility of phrase.Kamboji varnamwas the initial item. A short alapana ofHamsadwanigave place toRaghunayakawith impressivejathisinSwarakalpana.Sri Rama PadamainAmrithavarshiniwas pleasing.Porvikalyani alapanawas liberal.Gnanamosagaradamight be a simple song set in tune with a simplethalalikerupakambut to get the thrill out of it is ingenuity, Jayaprada did it extremely well. TheRakthi Raga Kapicame out in bright colours and thekrithi,Inthasokhyamanine,was filled with sentiment.Varali,chosen from RTP, was judicious and was portrayed with all its fascination.

Sanjay started withAbhogi varnamand thekrithi,SarojanabhainChakravkam,added cadence to the ongoing concert. The highlight of the concert was the central piece,Thodi, which was sophisticated in the raga content, growing brighter as it progressed with skilful modulation of his voice. It is often felt that this modulation is sometimes carried out in excess.Jesinadella marachithivowas chosen for the raga. The interesting feature in thepallaviwas the embellishment ofNeravalin differentkalamswithin thethri-kalaconfiguration. T.M. Krishna commenced withKaanada varnamset toAta thala Rama ikanannubrovaradawas inspiring.

Both Ambika Prasad on the violin and Balaji on the mridangam extended impressive support to the concert.Bottom Template Starts
