VOne can predict the poise of a performer by the way the artist starts the programme. Duddu Radhika&#8217;s firm grasp on the rendition of the Hamsadhwani varnam &#8216;Jalajaksha&#8217; at two speeds spoke of her self-assurance and foreshadowed the t\u000areat to be followed. A quick pr&#233;cis of Atana was appended with Tyagaraja&#8217;s lively &#8216;Anupama Dunambuthi&#8217;. Though superfluous for a varnam, the swara accessories Radhika attached to the varnam and Atana showed that she can carefully couple swara and rhythm with sang-froid.For respite, Syama Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Mayamma&#8217; shimmered in Ahiri; this served as a perfect prelude to the vivacious Pantuvarali alapana. There was absolutely no haste or race to chase the phrases but a relishing relaxed journey gave Pantuvarali a different tone. &#8216;Sambo Mahadeva&#8217; supported by the niraval at &#8216;Sambo Mahadeva&#8217; in anupallavi with cascading swaras. &#8216;Nannu Kanna Talli&#8217; in Sindhu Kannada prefaced Radhika&#8217;s settling for the main raga Thodi. Without resorting to any overplay, Radhika captured the essence of Thodi with a traditional recipe of extended phrases positioned with space.&#8216;Emijesithe Nemi&#8217; once again from the chest of Tyagaraja found ideal treatment. Surprisingly, the customary treatise at &#8216;Kamamoha Dasulai&#8217; started with a bang but somehow ended with a whimper. Nevertheless, the swarakalpana brought out several subtle proyagas exclusive for Thodi with proper poignancy on swaras.Glitches? Yes, there were. Radhika&#8217;s voice slightly turned brittle at the upper registers because of a soar throat. The audio system wailed at regular intervals.T. Hemamalini&#8217;s violin tracked the vocalist&#8217;s vision without prejudice. Her essays of Pantuvarali and Thodi carried impressive ingenuity with emphasis on raga bhava. Kumbakonam K. Ramakrishnan&#8217;s singular support on mridangam lit up the concert in the swara sections especially and during thani avartanam.The tail end carried the usual light weight ragas Sindubhairavi, Hamsanandhi and Khamas. The programme was held under the banner of Shanmukhapriya at R.K. Swamy Hall.
