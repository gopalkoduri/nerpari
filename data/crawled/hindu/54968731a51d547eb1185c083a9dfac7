VMozart is now the world's most popular composer ahead in sales of Beethoven, Bach, Mahler, Wagner and Brahms. This fascination for the equilibrium and divine abstraction of Mozart's music began as his body turned cold in an unmarked Vienna graveyard and culminated in the frenzy of demand in 1991 the bicentenary of Mozart's death. The interest had already begun with the Milos Forman film &#8220;Amadeus&#8221; which in turn was based on Peter Schaffer's play based on Pushkin's drama &#8220;Salieri and Mozart&#8221; which was turned into a chamber opera by Rimsky Korzakov. Soon after the film, Mozart became a cult and a brand with a range of cosmetics named after Figaro, confectionary, chocolates, underwear, car horn, calling bell (with Mozart tunes) hotels, express trains and aeroplanes. There was even talk of a satellite being named after Mozart or Amadeus. Mozart's own middle name became a competitor of Mozart products and there was a bitter war for sales between Mozart and Amadeus. Mozart almost became a film superstar and there were thousands who heard the name but had never heard a bar of his music. This was very annoying for the connoisseurs who bought his complete works instead of a cologne named after him.How did this cult arrive? Well, Mozart's music in his lifetime was popular and after his death he never lost this popularity. His wife and sister helped the first Mozart biographer Otto Jahn. Simultaneously came Ludwig Kochel's complete catalogue of Mozart works. Thus Mozart has &#8220;K&#8221; numbers instead of opus numbers. This catalogue was complete while the first birth anniversary arrived in 1856. The catalogue has been revised many times since with the discovery of new works. Along with the catalogue of Mozart's works came the hurry to complete his unfinished &#8220;Requiem&#8221;, study of his handwriting and the watermark in the score paper which helped to date his works and chart out a progressive creativity.Along with all this scholarly activities came Mozartina, the tribute by other composers. There was Franz Liszt turning Mozart operas into piano compositions to help popularise them in piano as it was the instrument of the century. There was a variation by Beethoven himself based on a theme from Figaro; then there was Tchaikovsky's suite &#8220;Mozartina&#8221;. In the 20th Century, there was composer Max Reger's &#8220;Variations&#8221; on a theme by Mozart. Came 1891 and the death centenary year and Mozart found a champion in Bernard Shaw then doing music criticism regularly. He wrote extensively about Mozart and &#8220;Don Giovanni&#8221; which was Shaw's favourite opera. Apart from Liszt, Thalberg composed piano transcriptions around Mozart as did the Russian Glinka and the French composer Bizet.&#8220;Out of Africa&#8221;As the years progressed and film as a new art form developed, tribute to Mozart came in the form of his music being used in films. There was very recently &#8220;Out of Africa&#8221; with the clarinet concerto which was also used by the French art filmmakers. Indeed, today Mozart is the composer most used in films. All filmmakers have been captivated by the equilibrium and balance of his abstract music. Mozart was like the marble from which sculptors could create their forms. This could not be said of the more strident music of Beethoven. Mozart made the listener think of his own world and leads to a comprehension of life. Another phenomenon which has helped in Mozart's popularity, is the finding from time to time of lost music. In 1956 during his birth bicentenary, a lost movement of the very popular serenade &#8220;Eine Kleine Nachtmusic&#8221; was found. There have been many lost movements that have surfaced.There have been moments in this hype given to Mozart that the truth has been distorted. This was the film &#8220;Amadeus&#8221; where unnecessary emphasis was given to Mozart's so-called rival Salieri. The film shows that Salieri was there in the Mozart household when he lay on his death bed, this is not true. As a result of all this hype on Salieri and his poisoning that his music too has become popular in the CD era. It is in fact quite attractive and of the highest quality.Another factor that pushed Mozart towards a cult is the so-called theory that Mozart's music is good for babies in and out of the womb. A whole range of CDs have flooded the market with &#8220;Mozart for Babies&#8221; tag. This has come about for the same reason why Mozart is so popular with filmmakers. His music is abstract and malleable.All this points to the inexhaustible interest in the phenomenon called Mozart whose fascination for the serious lovers of his music has not in any way been disturbed by all the advertising gimmick. Granted that the TV commercial for Titan watches increased the sale of Mozart's Symphony No 25 in G minor, it is not because of the hype that Mozart exists in the centre of the lives of music lovers. His music has been dissected in serious books like Robins Landon's &#8220;Mozart's Last Year&#8221; and Wolfgang Hieldesheimer's book &#8220;Mozart&#8221;. Hieldesheimer's book gives a strong Freudian emphasis to Mozart's sex life highlighted in the film &#8220;Amadeus&#8221;. The cult will be lost and forgotten but Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart will remain an eternal puzzle in his life and divine in his music.
