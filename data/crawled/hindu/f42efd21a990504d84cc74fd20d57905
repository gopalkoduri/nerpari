VThere was a strong hint of imitation in the singing (for four hours) of Vellore R.Giridharan for Gana Mukundapriya at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan recently.If indeed there was a conscious attempt on the part of the artiste to reproduce a particular style, it was clearly unsuccessful (as all artificiality is devoid of inherent appeal), never mind that it was unnecessary, as Giridharan is endowed with a genuinely rich and powerful voice and can potentially create original and high quality music.In the alapana to ragas Hamsanadam, Latangi and Hanumatodi, Giridharan was straining to reproduce the magical voice of Sarvasri Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna. But his presentation of `Bantureetikoluvu' and `Yentamuddu' merely amplified the futility of such an attempt.His inability to sustain the effort, however questionable, was all the more obvious when Giridharan was reaching for the higher octave. Imitation is inherently inimical to imagination and spontaneity  -   the very attributes that form the core of Balamurali's music.Accompanists Melakkaveri Thiagarajan with the violin, Thillaisthanam Suryanarayanan who played the mridangam, Venkatesh the ghatam and Nirgunam Manikandan the morsing saw through the performance in a professional manner.GARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMBottom Template Starts
