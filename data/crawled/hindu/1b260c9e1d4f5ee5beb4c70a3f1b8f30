VIt is hard to get kids, all but the most motivated, to take an interest in classical music, a world where the talk is of a lifetime of learning rather than shortcuts to fame. Thankfully there are enough dedicated teachers of serious music and dance to keep the arts in a healthy state of revival, and organisations willing to stage the performances of the young aspirants to supply them with the much needed pat on the back. Gayathri Fine Arts believes that as stage performances are essential to the development of a professional, short recitals go a long way in helping youngsters get experience. Recently Gayathri presented three budding violinists, disciples of C.S. Anuroop, in a short recital at Triveni theatre. Vidya Ramesh, R. Radha and J. Aswhin gave a good account of themselves, accompanied on the mridangam by S. Raghunandan and B. Manohar, both disciples of Kumbakonam Padmanabhan.Bottom Template Starts
