VT.K.GANAPATHYWith assiduous practice, Baby Sreeram, blessed with a pleasant voice  suited to Carnatic music, can attain  concert standards.Her interpretation of kirtanas and raga exposition at the vocal recital held under the aegis of Alapana, Coimbatore, revealed that she had poor  voice control. Her  swarasthana slips and  insufficient azhutham at the higher panchamam diluted  the quality of sublime music.She began with swaras for `Tulasidala' in Mayamalavagowla  which was followed by a breezy presentation of `Vaade Venkatadri' in Vasantha. Her Sahana alapana was  repetitive with stereotyped phrases and was marred by tonal slips.The esoteric appeal in Tyagaraja's  `Eevasudha,' following the raga vinyasam, was also missing. `Neevadane Gaana' in Saranga and `Nambikkettavar Yaaraiya' (Hindolam) moved at a sprightly pace.She outlined the main raga of the kutcheri, Kalyani, with an impressive profile but she found it difficult to do the sancharas forming the essence of the raga for the song, `Talli Ninnu Nera.' Her own composition on Muruga in Charukundalam (of Charukesi janyam) was presented elegantly with flourish.The artiste would do well to hone her skill in the delineation of ragas. Swaminathan (violin), Parameswaran (mridangam) and Suresh (ghatam) were the accompanists.Bottom Template Starts
