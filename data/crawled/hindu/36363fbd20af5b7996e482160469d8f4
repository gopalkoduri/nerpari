VSankari displayed heightened ability to draw on her acquired understanding of the demands of performance satisfaction. A rasika could sense her commitment to Carnatic purity, sincerity and communicative skill to convey her faith in the traditional heritage. The songs she chose pointed to this: &#8216;Sogasujooda Tharama&#8217; (Kannada Gowla) &#8216;Naadadina Mata&#8217; (Janaranjani) &#8216;Sankari Sam Kuru&#8217; (Saveri) &#8216;Kamakshi Varalakshmi&#8217; (a Dikshitar composition in Bilahari) and &#8216;Chakkani Rajamargamu&#8217; (Kharaharapriya).It is a mystery of creativity that it can either sublimate or be just a musical exercise. The choice reveals the intentions of a performer. Sankari Krishnan seemed to be satisfied with confining herself to Carnatic environment.She directly transformed this preference in the alapanas of Janaranjani, Saveri and Kharaharapriya. There was no extravaganza of technique or paucity of sancharas in bringing out the images of the ragas. Though the phrasings, as they progressed were somewhat fast-driven, there was refinement. Aesthetic experience comes from constant application of the mind on this quality and Sankari Krishnan has to rise from her present status to the higher level.The rendering of kirtanas was precise and disciplined. She saw to it that she placed before the rasikas the raga-bhava of the structured sahityas.By adhering strictly to the sahityas and sangatis, the depth of the songs could easily be perceived. The Kannada Gowla and Bilahari pieces were plain and smooth and the Kharaharapriya major was given its due.Sankari Krishnan was happy with the two accompanists &#8211; Usha Rajagopalan (violin) and Mannarkoil Balaji (mridangam). Playing at the same wavelength of the vocalist, the violinist&#8217;s solo versions of the ragas were replete with swiftness and pace. More of madhyamakala sancharas would have paid better dividend. Balaji&#8217;s support was more than mechanical and intellectual rhythm.The patterns both during accompanying songs and thani were intensely vigorous but all the same gentle. His laya vidwat was sound enough to perceive how much was needed to enhance the kutcheri effort.
