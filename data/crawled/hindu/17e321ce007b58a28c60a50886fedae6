VTotal commitment, involved articulation and elegance  characterised the vocal concert of T.M. Krishna at the Pongal music festival of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Coimbatore.He enthralled the audience with a stirring &#8216;Theradeeyakaradha&#8217; in Gowlibandhu with swaras. &#8216;Brochevarevarura&#8217;  came along next with niraval and swaras rendered at a frenetic pace.Anandabhairavi raga alapana for &#8216;Ethanaiththan Viddhai&#8217; was elaborated with the edifice built brick by brick, revealing the nuances of the raga clearly.The concert gained momentum with &#8216;Sarasa Saamadhana&#8217; in Kapinarayani. The vocalist&#8217;s exposition of Kharaharapriya with intricate and lengthy karvais created an aura of the raga for the kriti, &#8216;Ayyappan Avatarittha Kathaamritham&#8217;. The sangatis, glides, swirls and gamakas used exuded charm and resulted in sowkhyam for the listener.Krishna&#8217;s presentation of &#8216;Vaa Muruga&#8217;, &#8216;Pagaivanukkarulvaai&#8217;, &#8216;Oruthi Maganaai Pirandhu&#8217; and &#8216;Madhava Maamava&#8217; were worthy choices.Sreeramkumar on the violin responded to the vocalist on the same wavelength in sketching the ragas and swara sallies.Prasad (mridangam) and Rajaganesh (ganjira) gave able support. Their thani was commendable.
