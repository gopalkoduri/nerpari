VThe seasoned vocalist chose wisely and well by favouring the subtle over the sensational. No build up to fever pitch, no rain of exhibitionistic brigas, no regimented line-up of superfluous kanakkus to mar economical swaraprastara &#8212; and here&#8217;s the good news, the approach worked. The recital was a triumph of understatement in which the composition was king.The mien was devout in the invocatory ugabhoga followed by &#8216;Vandisuvudhaadhiyali&#8217; (Nattai). Spontaneous permutations were value-additions to the sarvalaghu kalpanaswaras.The artiste etched a compact Abhogi with sharp strokes. &#8216;Tunge Mangala Tarange&#8217; with an interestingly structured opening line made optimum use of the scope for odukkal in sangathis during the kalpanaswara sallies, the final round catching the violinist off guard as it zeroed in on &#8216;Tarange&#8217;.An unhurried Poorvikalyani took its time making a comfortable statement.In effective contrast, the feisty niraval had a spring in its step, the zesty kalpanaswaras communicating the artiste&#8217;s evident enjoyment in the challenge of building pace and momentum after a nuanced &#8216;Mareyabeda manave&#8217;.Sangathis drawing sustenance from time-tested pidis defined compositions such as &#8216;Srinivasa&#8217; (Ritigowla), &#8216;Dasarendhare Purandhara Dasarayya&#8217; (Kambodhi) and &#8216;Tha Thattha Dhimitha&#8217; (Todi) with its lyrical description of the Lord&#8217;s attributes in the charanam.The clean, uncluttered lines of the Kalyani exposition settled for prayogas steeped in age-old appeal. More than the alapana, it was the niraval that served as a vehicle to explore the raga&#8217;s nooks and crannies in &#8216;Kallu Sakkare Kolliro&#8217;.Crisp kalpanaswara links caught and held attention.Regarded as the Sangeetha Pitamaha of the Carnatic tradition, Purandaradasa&#8217;s compositions are rich in devotional content as well as philosophical truths.The clear, accurate diction and emotive articulation reflecting the vocalist&#8217;s native pride and depth of involvement in the oeuvres of this great saint-composer lent an extra-special slant to the aural experience.Vittal Ramamurthy (violin) augmented the vocalist&#8217;s comfort zone with supportive karvais. Teamwork went like a breeze with  Melakkaveri Balaji&#8217;s (mridangam) instinctive responses based on a keen sense of anticipation generating percussive rhythms that anchored voice and strings in firm territory.Veena exponent Kalpagam Swminathan was felicitated with a memento and cash award by Musicologist S. A. K. Durga at the function which preceded M. S. Sheela&#8217;s concert.
