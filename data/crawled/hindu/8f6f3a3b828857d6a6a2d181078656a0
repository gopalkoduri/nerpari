VSruti Records' NadhanubhavamCarnatic classical vocalVasudhaa KeshavPrice not indicated (CD)Vasudhaa Keshav, a post graduate in music from the Mysore University, was trained under the Gurukula system, her preceptor being H. S. Mahalakshmi, a reputed guru of Karnataka belonging to the rich lineage of Tiger Varadachariar.Her album for Sruti Records beginning with `Tappulanniyu' in Bowli, one of the 108 kritis on Devi Chamundeswari by Harikesanallur Muthiah Bagavatar, provides a melodic welcome. Atana is elaborated with mellifluous time-tested phrases to which the talented violinist B. U. Ganesh Prasad responds with suitable sensitivity.Tyagaraja's `Ilalo Pranatharthihara' is a robust rendition with the Antara Gandharam making its presence felt strongly in the tara sthayi forays of the kriti.The kalpanaswaras in the pallavi, fluent and imaginative, enhance the sprightly momentum. `Sambho Mahadeva,' one of the Kovur Pancharatna compositions of Tyagaraja in Pantuvarali, and the neraval in the Anu Pallavi calm and composed with creditable sruti fidelity and laya control, reflect disciplined training coupled with inherent talent.Eschewing the compulsive, contemporary craze to board the bandwagon of frenetic pace, Vasudhaa impresses with a mature alapana of Sankarabharanam combining chowka, madhya and dhurita kala sancharas within the negotiable range of the octaves with a highly commendable sense of proportion, leaving one in an enjoyable musical zone.The essay on the violin is equally satisfying. The Syama Sastri jewel, `Saroja Dala Netri' with praiseworthy expansion of the lyrics `Sama Gana Vinodini,' impromptu swara passages, kuraippu and korvai are embedded with professional quality.Parupally Phalgun, the mridangist and A. S. Shankar, the ghatam artiste play a meticulous tani avartanam for the Adi talam and have also extended immaculate support throughout. Koteeswara Iyer's `Arul Seyya Venum Ayya' in the 72nd mela `Rasikapriya,' in spite of a couple of ifs and buts, makes pleasant listening.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
