VCascade of RagasNedunuri Krishnamurthy Swathi Soft Solutions MRP Rs. 250Carnatic ragas when presented in their pristine form, create a huge impact, for Carnatic music is to a great degree, raga oriented.The concerts of many past masters were fashioned in a manner as to give more importance to raga vinyasa over other aspects such as kriti, niraval and swaras.Swathi Soft Solutions has released an audio CD on exclusive raga singing by Nedunuri Krishnamurthy.This concept is merit-worthy and would benefit many an aspiring artist.The ragas chosen are weighty and cover Kharaharapriya, Mohanam, Purvikalyani, Sankarabharanam, Saveri, Thodi, Bhairavi, Khambodi and Madhyamavathi.Brief introductionsThe commencement of the raga renditions by the vocalist is preceded by brief introductions in English and Telugu. The script rightly mentions ragas as pivotal to Indian classical music.Further, mention is made that constant listening to the music of past and present artists will enable one to visualise the raga devatas.Nedunuri is well known for his expansive raga portrayals and he does full justice to the ragas rendered.A sense of vishranthi can be experienced in the alapanas covered by this disc.The vocalist's voice is in fine fettle and the unhurried treatment meted out to the portrayal of the melodies makes this recording a soothing and enjoyable session.The tambura is perfectly aligned to sruti and enhances the beauty of the music when the singer offers karvais.Credit for this concept as per the inlay card goes to Mala Mohan.
