VVidwan Ramaprasad entertained the audience at Jaganmohan Palace with his performances of devotional music in aid of the Spastic Society of Mysore. He was assisted by Rajalakshmi on the veena, Chandankumar on flute and Ravishankar on mridanga creating a symphony of vocal-veena- venu trio. With varied selections of Dasa and Sharana sahitya, the concert was impressive. The gamaka-bhava in alapana of raga Hindola ("Mamavathu Sri Saraswathi" of Mysore Vasudevacharya) though forceful in lower octave, the explorations in the higher octave remained mediocre. Rajalakshmi on veena and Chandan Kumar on flute filled in with the much-needed melody element. Blessed with good tonal quality, the artiste failed to reach the requisite depth of music in his rendition. Selecting compositions in popular tunes such as "Nammamma Sharade" and "Pilangoviya", the artiste kept the tempo of the concert. An abhang in Marathi (Samartha Ramadas) and "Bhagawan Tere Charanome", "Govinda Madhava", "Mere Janana Marana-ke-Saathi", "Tamboori Meetidava" and a vachana "Nadapriya Shiva Nembavanu" were rendered with ease. Tumkur B. Shivashankar maintained good rhythmical support and the concert was concluded with "Shanti Mantra" (Asatho-Ma-Sadgamaya). The performance fell short of the classical elements.Dance choreography by Indira Kadambi with the theme as Monsoon was effective. Indira Kadambi has created modest interest in such approach. However, pre-recoded music was a constraint to sanchari-bhavas and there weren't too much that could be attributed to his imagination. Stanakas were neat with nritta-nritya-and natya in charis.B.S.S.
