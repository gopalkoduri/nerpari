VA vocal recital by Vasudha Keshav last week was part of the Ananya Youth Music Festival, &#8216;Sangathi&#8217;, supported by the Directorate of Kannada and Culture. She was accompanied by Jyothsna Manjunath (violin), Radhesh (mridanga), and Bhagyala\u000akshmi Krishna (morsing).The artiste&#8217;s firm grounding and traditional orientation were established with the very first item of the concert, the navaragamalika varna in adi thala rendered in two speeds, followed by &#8220;Theliyaleru Rama&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in Dhenuka raga and adi thala, rendered with a few brisk kalpana swaras. A compact alapana of Ranjini that emphasised the inherent softness of the raga, with rests at the madhya sthayi shadja, dhaivatha and thara shadja, preceded &#8220;Paramapavana Papamochana&#8221; in adi thala.The Begada suite, comprising a raga elaboration, replete with subtle inflections and gamakas that reflected the identity of the raga as well as the individuality of the vocalist, and a crisp rendition of the Deekshithar krithi &#8220;Thyagarajaya Namasthe&#8221; in rupaka thala and fluent kalpana swaras, were some highlights of the concert. Greater clarity in the enunciation of the lyrics would have imparted an additional lustrous facet to the item.&#8220;Anupama Gunambudhi&#8221; in Athana raga and khanda chapu thala led to a detailed alapana of Kharaharapriya abounding in melodious sancharas and delicate nuances, with a fleeting sruthi bheda passage anchored at the thara sthayi rishabha, yielding the Thodi scale. &#8220;Rama Neeyeda&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi set to adi thala was presented with a well-proportioned neraval at &#8220;Kamini Veshadhariki&#8221; and kalpana swaras ornamented with a modicum of rhythmic combinations, followed by a thani avarthana.Earnest and competent violin accompaniment by Jyothsna Manjunath within the lead artiste&#8217;s mandate, and complementary support from the percussionists, were noteworthy features of the concert.The other artistes who performed during &#8216;Sangathi&#8217;, were M.S. Vidya (vocal) accompanied by Venkatesh Joshier (violin), B.S. Anand (mridanga) and Shashishankar (ghata), S.V. Narayan (vocal) accompanied by B.K. Raghu (violin), Tumkur B. Ravishankar (mridanga) and Bharadwaj Shatavalli (morsing), and Narasimha Murthy (flute) accompanied by Mathur Srinidhi (violin), B.R. Srinivas (mridanga), and B.J. Kiran Kumar (kanjira). M.S. Vidya, Venkatesh Joshier and B.S. Anand were awarded the Yuva Puraskara, while the Ananya Puraskara and the Shastra Kousthubha title were conferred on Kurudi Venkatachar and T.S. Vasantha Madhavi respectively. The valedictory function included a music ensemble by young artistes Vinay Sharva, Ravi Kiran G., Mathur Srinidhi, B.K. Raghu, Amit Nadig, Ashwin Adamya, Adarsh Shenoy and Krishna.
