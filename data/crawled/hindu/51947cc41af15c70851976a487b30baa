VSULOCHANA PATTABHIRAMANA Varnam in Kharaharapriya in Adi tala by Mudikondan Venkatrama Iyer, the singer R. Vedavalli's guru, and Dikshitar's `Maha Ganapathim' provided the required initial impetus indicative of an enjoyable, scholarly programme.Patnam Subramania Iyer's Bilahari kriti, `Paridama Michite' adorned with a few kalpanaswara sequences, and Tyagaraja's `Eti Yochanalu' in Kiranavali sung in the Desadi tala had a fey spirit that was fired by a rare stimulation.`Entarani,' one of Tyagaraja's beautiful kritis that has a different structural content in Harikhambodi had an extra sobriety, while the niraval was as always with Vedavalli, outstanding.The vidushi's hallmark is perfect presentation and her sarvalagu swaraprastaras were flawless with a lively laminated sheen.M.A.Krishnaswami, the violinist, Neyveli Narayanan, the mridangist and Sukanya Ram Gopal on the ghatam added verve to the exercise. Syama Sastry's `Brovamma' in Manji with the artiste completely internalising its mood and substance gently led the rasikas to a tranquil, peaceful musical haven.Festive spirit`Kanden Kanden Seethayai,' an Arunachala Kavirayar's composition in Vasantha, was sung with a festive spirit and a comprehensive alapana of Kedaragowla with imagination finding considerable flow in the oral expression, made a distinctive impression.Krishnaswami scored high on the Richter scale of melody.`Vanajanayanudani' of Tyagaraja was a welcome inclusion in the agenda, for it is not often that one gets to listen to it in concerts.Ramanathapuram Srinivasa Iyengar's `Nee Kelana' in Devamanohari with its chittaswaram sprinted merrily to lay the base for the marathon alapana delineation of Khambodi that was underlined by traditional prayogas to the core.Musical eloquenceThe exploration in the mantra sthayi was statements of musical eloquence. The accompanying support and the raga essay on the violin merited approbation.Tanam is the stronghold of the Mudikondan bani, and Vedavalli's articulation was a smooth waterfall of pertinent output singular to the genre that ought to serve as a model lesson to vidyarthis.Krishnaswami is not one to just toe the vocalist's line; his mind has an individual mode of thought that comes out with flying colours. His tanam was exemplary.While one expected a pallavi after the detailed tanam, the artiste chose `Sri Subrahmanya Namasthe' of Dikshitar.The song sung in a kalapramanam that appealed to one's appreciative sensibilities, was a hothouse of bhava-oriented music.The expansion of the lyrics, `Vasavadhi Sakala Deva Vandhithaya' has been given an immortal status by the titans of yesteryear &#151;  Ariyakkudi Ramanuja Iyengar, Madurai Mani Iyer and others.Vedavalli, most adept in niraval, kept listener attention hooked in her madhyama and dhurita kala elaborations.The swaras in two speeds were presented with musical and rhythmic cogence, with full cooperation from all the accompanists.Neyveli Venkatesh on the mridangam and Sukanya Ram Gopal on the ghatam are artistes of experience and quality, who played a fulfilling thani avartanam with much laya precision.Bottom Template Starts
