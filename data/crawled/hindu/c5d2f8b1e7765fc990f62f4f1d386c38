VKala Kruthi celebrated Independence Day and its 15th anniversary, at Sankaralayam, Chetput, recently. On the occasion, N.C.Soundaravalli, the chief guest, presented the annual A.M. Venugopal awards to musicians R.Suryaprakash and K.Gayathri. This was followed by a vocal recital by Trichur Brothers -- Sri Krishna Mohan and Ramkumar Mohan.Kala Kruthi should consider holding their programmes in better auditoriums for this hall has a natural reverb. which singers could find tough to negotiate. Despite the drawback, the brothers were perfect in their sruti alignment throughout the concert.Aural treatA bright start with Kalyani varnam was followed by a brief Aarabi( &#8216;Ganarajena Rakshitoham'- mishra chapu-Dikshitar). Sri Ranjani was then taken up for elaboration. The sruti-aligned phrases were an aural treat. Gifted with a supple voice, Sri Krishna Mohan built the foundation of the raga strongly. Sancharas oozed with the raga's content. It was interesting, when Ramkumar Mohan, the younger of the two, stayed taut on the madhyamam while Krishna Mohan was sketching the raga. Ram Kumar Mohan then took the baton to build it further. Thereafter the raga essay continued with exchanges and towards the end of the alapana the duo mesmerised with lengthy straight notes. The veteran in M.A.Krishnaswamy (violin) gave an authentic reply. &#8216;Brochevarevaray' (Adi), a beauty of Tyagaraja , with multi charanams was well-paced. Trichur Mohan (mridangam) was unique in that he played very short arudis. By then the mood for the evening was set. But the announcement that due to paucity of time, they would proceed straight to RTP in praise of the motherland in ragam Desh, came as a dampener. It was strange that the brothers chose to overlook the numerous classical ragas! Even a Todi, Shankarabharanam suite would not have warranted more than a 20- minute treatise. Krishnaswamy, well-aware of the raga's scope, played just for four minutes! There is nothing Carnatic about Desh.
