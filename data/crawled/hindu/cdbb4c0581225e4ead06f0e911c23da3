VExcept for the first item on Ganesha, all others were on Lord Vishnu in Prema Rangarajan's concert for Parthasarathi Swami Sabha, perhaps because it was Vaikunta Ekadasi day. The programme was a case of familiar ragas but unfamiliar compositions.After the essay of Suddhadhanyasi, Prema prefixed a sloka from the Bhagavatam to `Sri Parthasarathi'. The niraval and swaras for this were impressive from both Prema and the violinist Sanjeev. The Paasuram before Embar Ragavasimham's composition, `Tamarai Kangal Thirandhennai Parai' in Hamsanandi brought out the devotional aspect and was more effective than the alapana.Tyagaraja's `Chalu Chalu' in Saveri and `Rangapathe' in Kanada by Margadarsi Sesha Iyengar were rendered well and emanated a sense of peace. The main item was Thodi, the alapana had no new ideas but had depth. Vasudevachar's `Neramemi Napai Neerajaksha' was taken up with commendable niraval and swaras for the pallavi.Nellai Balaji on the mridangam maintained a smiling countenance throughout and provided good support and played a decent thani. Suddhananda Bharati's `Ulagaitthurumbena' was rendered partly as viruttam and partly as a song in Bagesri. Again, the devotional aspect came to the fore.The final item, Annamacharya's  `Thatha Thikudi Dheem' in Mohanam,  had an enticing, rhythmic feel.Bottom Template Starts
