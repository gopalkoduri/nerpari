VIt was a big surprise to see Sudha Raghunathan and her accompanists,  recently at the Kamaraj domestic terminal arrival hall, that too when the music season is going on in full swing.While Sudha was swarmed by her rasikas, violin vidwan Embar S. Kannan said, &#8220;We are just returning from Pune after participating in the Sawai Gandharv Music festival.This festival has been on for 55 years. That it is conducted in a school maidan under a large pandal, which can house about 20000 people proves the enormity of the fest. It is some what similar to our Tiruvaiyaru celebrations. We were really awestruck at the professional manner in which the entire event  was conducted.&#8221;Morsing player R.Raman excitedly interrupted,  &#8220;Our concert was on a Sunday. As the screen went up we were astonished by the huge turnout. We were told that it was  around 20000. I have to thank Sudhaji for this opportunity. The hospitality was good. As morsing was new to them, a brief impromptu demo of the instrument was also given. The crowd was thrilled.&#8220;Palladam Ravi and I received special accolades for the thani avartanam.&#8221;After locating her baggage Sudha returned:  &#8220;The huge crowd was very learned. The applause for the Ritigowlai alapana went on  for several minutes.&#8220;That apart I sang Khamas and Pantuvarali, and an abhang. All of which drew appreciation. I was deeply touched by the words  of a rasika who said my portrait will  find a place in his photo gallery, where pictures  of stalwarts were showcased. It was a once-in-a- life-time-experience.&#8221;Pandit Bhimsen Joshi&#8217;s son Srinivas Joshi, one of the main organisers, informed us that it is predominantly a Hindustani music festival and that artists  such as M.S.Subbulakshmi,Dr.M Balamuralikrishna, M.S.Goplalakrishnan and U.Shrinivas from the South,  have participated in the earlier years.&#8220;This year it was L.Subramanian, Sudha Raghunathan and Alarmelvalli. The response was incredible. It was heartening to note Sudha&#8217;s rapport with the audience,&#8221; he said.
