VHARINI RAOMood-elevation to sublime levels, serenity and recharging of the body and the soul &#151;  this is what we all crave for, after a gruelling day's work.  And perhaps nothing can equal listening to a flute recital live. It was a treat   when the students  of Uttaraa -   Centre for Performing Arts,  held the audience transfixed for over  two hours with their performance.The senior students of Jayaprada Ramamurthy,  N. Shankari, Maitreyi Jayaseelan, R.P. Raju, Venkat Sharan and Krishna Chaitanya, were at their best, with support from Durga Bhavani on the violin,  G. Ramachandran on the mridangam and  Srikanth on the kanjira. A varnam by Pachimiriyam Adi Appayya, in ragaBhairavi,Khanda Jaathi Ata Taalam, was the invocating melody where the performers showcased just about a glimpse of what one was yet to behold in the coming items. Thevarnamwas rendered with utmost technical perfection, adorning thetaalamand keeping pace with the dulcetlaya.Manasa Etulortune, a Thyagaraja composition in ragaMalayamarutham, had tranquilising nuances that almost made it easier to get a slice of nirvana in one precious evening. The flautists played along theRupaka Taalam.Raga Swara Ranjaniis one raga that definitely sounds like a happy evening in the woods.Raghunatha Nannu, a composition of Srinivasa Iyengar inDasadi Taalam, only reinforced the feelings.Next came the talent-scooperMaragada Valli, in ragaKambhoji, by Muthuswami Dikshitar composed inAdi taalam, a  number that evinced each performer's prowess.Dheera Sameere, the Jayadeva Ashtapadi, composed by Prema Ramamurthy in the ever-popular ragaYaman Kalyani, and set to the 16-beatAdi taalam, was maturely rendered with very unusualswara-sangathis. The entire soiree was enthralled, with the undulating display oflaya. The ultimate performance of the Thillana in the haunting ragaMishra Chapuset inAdi taalamwas a composition of the maestro Lalgudi Jayaraman. It was divine, to say the least.It was an enjoyable   event, what with the coordinated ensemble of flute, violin, mridangam and kanjira weaving magic through soulful intonations. Not just the flute renditions but also the customary percussion act kept the audiences asking for more.Bottom Template Starts
