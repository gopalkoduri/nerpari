VA ccompanied by H.N. Baskar on the violin, Arjun Ganesh on the mridangam and Anirudh Athreya on the ganjira, Sankari Krishnan gave a brisk start to her concert at Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore, with the Devagandhari varnam and followed it up with a kriti on Lord Ganesa in Kedaram.Sankari Krishnan's alapanas of Ritigowla for the kriti, &#8216;Oraarumugane,' Mayamalavagowla for &#8216;Vidulaghu,' Janaranjani for &#8216;Vidajalathura' and Thodi for the kriti, &#8216;Gatineevani' were well-designed and marked by intensity of feeling. Her uninterrupted flow and perceptive brilliance in the interpretation of the numbers she had chosen registered well with the listeners.Sankari's scholastic RTP of Urmika in chatusra jhampai, khanda nadai for the pallavi &#8216;Devi Brova Samayamide' was the main piece of the recital. The tukkadas towards the end were time-fillers. Baskar's support on the violin was an asset to the vocalist. Arjun Ganesh (mridangam) and Anirudh Athreya (ganjira) bolstered up the concert in providing rhythmic patterns in the percussion wing.Winsome renditionHarmony and melody in perfect coordination and synchronisation permeated the ambience of Mani High School auditorium with the soothing strains from the deft bowing of the violins of the siblings, Akkarai Subhalakshmi and Sornalatha at the festival. It was a steady, bright stream of rhythm that flowed fluently from their instruments making it difficult for the aficionados to say who played better of the two. The technique of their play was uniform sans frills from the start to finish.Commencing their recital with Ata tala varnam in Kanada in two speeds, their &#8216;Siddhivinayakam' (Shanmukhapriya) with swaras was a winsome rendition with swaras. The Bhairavi swarajati coming next was gamaka-oriented revealing their vidwat and manodharma. The Saveri raga vinyasam by Sornalatha for the kriti, &#8216;Muruga, Muruga' created a tranquil mood. The melody of the Kaapi raga delineation by the elder sister for the kriti, &#8216;Intha Sowkya' was supreme with enchanting prayogas.Their alapana of Dharmavati for RTP in Adi talam, khanda nadai for the Pallavi &#8216;Paalinchu Bangaru Kamakshi,' step by step was the tour-de-force of the kutcheri. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and Karthick (ghatam) played punch-packed strokes adding meaning to their percussion support. Together, they, painted a picture of laya in their vibrant thani.Vijay Siva was a picture of dignity while displaying his musical wares. As is his wont, his high standard of classicism and effective homework paid rich dividends. Well-aligned to sruti, he began with &#8216;Karikalabhamukham' in Saveri to set a bright tone to the recital and followed it up with &#8216;Orajupu' in Kannadagowla with a feisty niraval and swaras. His sangatis while unfolding Varali were innovative and his effective structure of the raga revealed the raga swaroopa and bhava for the kriti, &#8216;Aadiya Paadame.' Tyagaraja's &#8216;Evaritho' (Maanavathi) was a bhava-rich presentation.Vijay Siva's delineation of Khambodi built up by telling phrases brought out the rakti of the raga in a distinct way for the Kamalamba Navavarna kriti, &#8216;Kamalambika.' he niraval followed by precise swaraprastharas with a fine set of korvai drew wide acclaim. The Abheri raga sketch for RTP, the main piece of the concert, for the Pallavi &#8216;Paagai Urugudu Nenje' had an aesthetic finesse.Clarity of diction, sruti shuddham and sahitya bhava in the performance was sukhanubhava. Charulatha Ramanujam's violin accompaniment was seductive in the velvety manner of her solo versions of ragas. The dynamic accompaniment of Manoj Siva (mridangam) and Sridhar (ghatam) in providing the necessary tonal variations in the percussion side lent dignity to the concert.Wide rangeThe wide vocal range and ability to negotiate the octaves from the base to the crescendo with effortless ease was evident in the vocal concert of Nithyasree Mahadevan on the final day of the festival. Her initial Andholika kriti, &#8216;Nee Dayaradha' with chittaswarams was an instance of her speed craft in presentation.Pulsating swaraprastaras captivated the rasikas in &#8216;Ramaneepai' (Kedaram). &#8216;Eesane Inda Ezhaikkiranga' (Chakravaham) stood out for clear diction ad razor-sharp etching of sangatis after an elaborate alapana.The delineation of Madhyamavathi for the kriti, &#8216;Evarichira' had a wide sweep with unusual prayogas and aesthetic brigas softened by jarus. Raghavendra Rao (violin) provided melodic modulation.The thani of Skanda Subramanian (mridangam) and Raman (morsing) was well-balanced with segments of soft and subtle rhythmic layers.
