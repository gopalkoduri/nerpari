VB. RAMADEVISalem Sangeetha Vidwat Sabha's `Selathil Thiruvaiyaru,' held at Deiveekam Kalyana Mandapam, Salem, was a week-long silver jubilee affair,  featuring vocal concerts, a veena recital and a Harikatha. Founded by Salem G. Desikan, this Sabha has rendered yeoman service to Carnatic music by encouraging and promoting innumerable young musicians.Unforgettable feastThe festival began with the inauguration of Salem Sri Desikan Isai Arangam by Lalgudi G. Jayaraman. The musical offering that started with the local artistes in the morning went on till evening (9-6) on all days. After that, artistes of great stature presented unforgettable feasts to the public, converting the casual listener to a die-hard rasika of Carnatic music.On the first day, T.M.Krishna kept the audience under thrall with his delectable performance. His Khambodi had a haunting effect on the rasikas. ``Rama Nee Samanamevaru" (Kharaharapriya), "Everimaata'' (Khambodi), "Teliyareru Rama" (Dhenuka), "Guruleka'' (Gowri Manohari) and ``Nidhi Saala Sukhama'' (Kalyani) were presented as offerings to Saint Tyagaraja. The lighter session consisted of favourites such as ``Karpooram Naarumo'' and ``Irakkam Varaamal Ponathenna Kaaranam."Chinmaya Sisters, Uma and Radhika, gave a pleasing recital on the second day. Their mellifluous voice, choice of kritis and the elaborate Todi alapana won them many admirers. Harikatha exponent Kalyanapuram R. Aravamudhachariar's discourse on Sadguru Tyagaraja's `Ramanubhavam' transported the audience to a different age and world.Madurai T.N. Seshagopalan gave a veena recital proving that he was equally adept at handling the divine instrument. He well deserved the title, `Vainika Gayaka Siromani,' that was conferred on him.Sanjay Subrahmanyan's concert was a lovely blend of majesty and tenderness. His presentation made old timers remember the music of Salem G. Desikan.He rendered "Swara Raga Sudha Rasa'' with an elaborate alapana of Sankarabharanam, drawing out the quintessential beauty of the raga. He sang many devout kritis of Tyagaraja and made the latter part of his session enjoyable with ``Sagara Sayana Vibho," "Summa Summa," "Kanavendamo'' and "Govardhana Giridhara."`Malladi Brothers' Sriram Prasad and Ravikumar stole the show with their cheerful stage presence, vibrant voice and  appealing presentation.Priya Sisters Haripriya and Shanmukhapriya, who sang on the concluding day, were at their usual best. All the artistes had excellent support from the most notable accompanying artistes.Aradhana celebratedOn the Bahula Panchami day, Tyagabrahmam's Aradhana was observed with `unchavriti' and Pancharatna kritis."Nowka Charitram" (an opera composed by Tyagaraja based on Krishna's leela with the gopis) was sung this year instead of the usual Utsava Sampradaya kritis.Bottom Template Starts
