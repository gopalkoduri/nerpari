VTucked away in some undistinguished time slot, singing only for a handful of well wishers, Seetha Narayanan proved a poignant point: it takes the seasoned to make a good Season. Seetha, a venerable teacher and a disciple of Semmangudi, provided her small audience such a wonderfully refreshing concert, so different from the blitzkrieg of notes that passes for &#8216;music&#8217; these days.The main piece of the concert was so intoxicating that one wonders if it was Thodi or toddy! To listen to the alapana was like meditating. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Koluvamaragada&#8217; was chosen and the niraval at &#8216;Chekkuni gunamula&#8217; was so deeply spiritual that it made one&#8217;s eyes well up. Swaras appeared at &#8216;tambura,&#8217; a point that is one beat earlier than the start of the cycle. What a Thodi!The accompanists did a great job. Perhaps inspired by the vocalist, violinist R Hemalatha played an equally brilliant Thodi alapana and supported well through the rendition. Tiruvidaimarudur Sankaran&#8217;s nuanced support on the mridangam buoyed the concert. Earlier, Seetha sang a lovely Kapi (&#8216;Vihara manasa&#8217;) of Swati Tirunal, with niraval and swaras at &#8216;Karunarasa nilaye.&#8217; What added colour to the whole concert was the singer&#8217;s sweet voice, clear and ringing and fully amenable to modulation. The flipside of the concert was the rather long tail, which rather diluted the solemnity of the show.  Seetha sang a sloka (Anjana Sukumaran-for it was the &#8216;Hanumath Jayanti&#8217; day) in Madhuvanthi followed by &#8216;Mangala murthi Maruta&#8217; of Tulsidas. It was followed by a Tamil song beginning &#8216;Thandai tai irundal.&#8217; One would have sworn it was Jonpuri, but the singer later said it was Shanmukhapriya &#8212; this style of Shanmukhapriya deserves to be researched into. And finally came a sloka in Bageshri and another Tulsidas composition.
