VDevotion was the key note of the nine-day music fete at the Navarathri Mandapam in Thiruvananthapuram as musicians, both veterans and up-and-coming, paid musical homage to the Goddess.Aswathi Tirunal Rama Varma&#8217;s concert began the fiesta  on a musical note. Beginning the concert with &#8216;Sarasijanabha,&#8217; a varnam in Kamboji (Ata tala), he showed his grip on tala and laya as he sang the pallavi, anupallavi and chittaswaram in different speeds. A sonorous &#8216;Paripalayamam&#8217; in Reethigowla was followed by a nuanced &#8216;Parvathi Nayakam&#8217; in Bouli, &#8216;Vihara Manasa Rame&#8217; in Kapi and &#8216;Paramapurusham&#8217; in Lalithapanchamam. The main piece &#8216;Devi Jaga Janani&#8217; in Sankarabharanam, the raga for the first day of the fete, was the piece-de-resistance of the concert.Accompanists Vardarajan (violin), B. Harikumar (mridangam), Karthik (ghatam) and Payyanur Govinda Prasad (morsing) were at their best. &#8216;Jalaja Bandhu&#8217; in Suruti and &#8216;Japath Japath Hari Namam,&#8217; a raga malika in Mishra maand, Sushama, Behag and Sindhubharavi were the thukkadas.On the second day, Sreevalsan J. Menon&#8217;s recital started with a pleasing &#8216;Padmanabha Pahi&#8217; in Malayamarutham. &#8216;Jaya Jaya Padmanabha&#8217; in Manirangu, and &#8216;Daanisa,&#8217; a Thodi pada varnam followed. Sreevalsan&#8217;s rendering reminded the listeners of his guru, the inimitable Neyyattinkara Vasudevan. The main &#8216;Pahimam Sri Vageeswari&#8217; in Kalyani was followed by a melting padam &#8216;Mullapoo malaramban&#8217; in Sahana, &#8216;Saramaina&#8217; in Behag and a memorable &#8216;Vishweshwara&#8217; in Sindhubhairavi. Sreevalsan was accompanied by the accompanists who played on the first day.The third day had T.M. Krishna singing a well modulated concert that was in tune with the pristine ambience of the Mandapam. His recital was a little different as he concentrated on the main piece of the day, which was &#8216;Devi Pavane&#8217; in Saveri, and the varnam &#8216;Sarasijanabha&#8217; but it was no less melodious.He was accompanied by R.K. Sriramkumar (violin) Poongulam Subramaniam (mridangam) and P.S.Purushothaman (ganjira). &#8216;Pahitharakshu&#8217; in Anandabhairavi was sung softly with a lot of bhava. &#8216;Smara Janaka&#8217; in Behag was followed by the Kamboji varnam &#8216;Sarasijanabha&#8217; for which he sang a fairly long niraval. After the main Saveri was sung there was just time for a hurriedly sung &#8216;Vishweshwara.&#8217;Youngster Amrutha Venkatesh started with a sweet but stately Neelambari varnam &#8216;Saarasa shara sundara&#8217; on the fourth day. She was accompanied by Avaneeswaram S. Vinu, Babu and Sudheer. &#8216;Mamavasada Janani&#8217; in Kanada was followed by &#8216;Paripahi&#8217; in Kalyani, and &#8216;Bhogeendrashayinam&#8217; in Kuntalavarali. The main piece was &#8216;Bharathi Mamava&#8217; in Thodi. The highlight of her concert was &#8216;Aliveni,&#8217; &#8216;Namasudharasa&#8217; and &#8216;Japath Japath,&#8217; which were brilliantly sung in the latter half of her concert.Sanjay Subrahmanyan, accompanied by Mahadeva Sharma (violin), Palakkad Maheshkumar (mridangam) and Manjoor Unnikrishnan (ghatam), gave a brilliant concert on the fifth day. &#8216;Sadu Thada&#8217; in Vakulabharanam, tuned by Rama Varma, set the mood of the concert. &#8216;Kalayami&#8217; in Kannada, &#8216;Shaurey&#8217; in Durbar and &#8216;Smarahari&#8217; were the delectable appetisers that led to the main &#8216;Janani mamavameye&#8217; in Bhairavi. The thukkadas were &#8216;Reenamadanutha,&#8217; in Behag, &#8216;Sees ganga&#8217; and &#8216;Bansivale&#8217; in Mohanam.Thrissur V. Ramachandran ably assisted by M.A. Sundareswaran (violin), Prapancham Ravindran (mridangam) and Vaikom Gopalakrishnan (ghatam) held centre stage on the sixth day.He began with the Bouli piece &#8216;Parvathi Nayaka.&#8217; &#8216;Saroruhasana jaye&#8217; in Panthuvarali, the composition for day six, was handled with finesse.  The Mohanakalyani composition &#8216;Sevesrikantham&#8217; was a connoisseur&#8217;s delight. Sundareshwaran on the violin was superb in essaying this &#8216;ranjak&#8217; raga.Among the other renditions of the evening, &#8216;Narasimha mamava,&#8217; &#8216;Sadara mava&#8217; and &#8216;Kalayami raghurama&#8217; in Arabhi, Saraswathi and Begada respectively stood out.&#8216;Janani pahi sada&#8217; was the main composition on the seventh day. This piece in Shudha Saveri was taken up for ragalapana, thanam, niraval and manodharma swaram by versatile vocalist T.V. Gopalakrishnan.  &#8216;Kalayami&#8217; in Kannada, &#8216;Sarasasuvadana&#8217; in Kalyani and &#8216;Sankarasrigiri&#8217; in Hamsanandi struck an immediate rapport with the audience.Compositions such as &#8216;Paripahi&#8217; in Saveri, &#8216;Shambho satatam&#8217; in Varamu, &#8216;Bhavayami&#8217; in Madhyamavathi and &#8216;Paripalaya&#8217; in Kamavardhini added variety to the musical menu. Akkarai Subbalakshmi (violin), T.V. Vasan (mridangam) and V. Suresh (ghatam) accompanied the vocalist admirably.It was the turn of Amritha Murali, a promising youngster, to display her calibre on the eighth day of the festival. &#8216;Sava marusha,&#8217; a Chouka varnam in Kamas, was the opening piece. Hemalatha (violin), Nanjil Arul (mridangam) and Adichanalloor Anil Kumar (ghatam) gave coordinated accompaniment. &#8216;Pahi janani&#8217; in Nattakurinji was the centre piece of the day. The singer was able to bring out the beauty of the raga by weaving intricate patterns. &#8216;Gangeya vasana&#8217; in Hamirkalyani and &#8216;Saramaina&#8217; in Behag captivated the audience.Parassala B. Ponnammal is a living legend of Carnatic music. The last day belonged to her and she made it memorable by singing the main composition &#8216;Pahi Parvatha&#8217; in Arabhi. Accompanists Amritha Murali (violin), B. Ganapathi Raman (mridangam) and Udupi S. Sridhar (ghatam) came good in the concert.&#8216;Kripayapalaya&#8217; in Charukeshi), &#8216;Mamavasada&#8217; in Kanada), &#8216;Samodam&#8217; in Ramapriya and &#8216;Alarsara&#8217; in Surutti enchanted the audience. &#8216;Kamalajasya,&#8217; a ragamalika that described the Dasavataras in ragas Bilahari, Dhanyasi, Saranga, Madhyamavathi, Attana, Nattakurinji, Darbar and Anandabhairavi was a special treat. &#8216;Bhujagashayino&#8217; in Yadukulakamboji brought the concert and the festival to a close.
