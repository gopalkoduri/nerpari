VGUDIPOODI SRIHARIIt is said that the combination of &#8216;three Sevens&#8217; (07.07.07.) occurs in the calendar once in a hundred years. That happened on last Saturday July 7, 2007. Perhaps people did not realise that even the &#8216;Saptami&#8217; (Seventh Day of \u000aTelugu calendar) also fell on that day. There are people who definitely use this rare occasion to do something special, to mark the event.Hawaiian guitar player Jaywant Naidu who mended his Western instrument guitar to play Hindustani music, decided to play seven Hindustani ragas in seven varied rhythms. And he did it at the Ravindra Bharathi under the auspices of Manasa Art Theatres on that unique day. Jayawant also thought it wise to link this to people&#8217;s urge to get the &#8216;seventh wonder&#8217; status to historical Taj Mahal. Here too, there is this figure &#8216;Seven&#8217;. Jaywant named his programme as &#8216;Saptaswara raga talam&#8217;. Obviously saptaswara is seven notes and seven talas of different structures. The repertoire Jaywant chose was also peculiar. Jaywant started the concert with raga Hamsadhwani in which the composition was set to Jaap taal (10 beats). The next item was in raga Madhukauns set to Rupak taal (7 beats) and a folk tune in raga Kirawani in Keharwa taal (8 beats).Kiravani has all the seven swaras both in arohana and avaroha. Jayawant then played a composition in raga Megh, which generally heralds monsoon. It is a melody set in a 12 beat rhythmic cycle of Ek taal. The next piece was a composition of Sri Ganapati Satchidanana Swami in raga Jaijaiwanti, set to Deepchandi taal of 14 beats. Then he played raag Maru Behag in which he played &#8216;alaap&#8217;, &#8216;Jod&#8217; and a &#8216;Gaat&#8217; in Madhyalaya teen taal of 16 beats. The serious part of that was concluded with a fast rhythmic &#8216;Jhala&#8217; in Drut teen taal. The concluding items were a folk tune in raga Shivaranjani set to Dadra taal (6 beats) and a film tuneJane Kaha Gaaye Woh Dinrendered by Mukhesh. This was in S\u000aivaranjani that ended with Jaywant touching the &#8216;ati taar saptak shaadaj&#8217; (highest octave) in the end. The amalgamation of seven ragas set in seven taalas played on Hawaiian guitar was a novel idea presented before some senior Hindustani musicians of Hyderabad like tabla player Ustad Nayeem Khan and Sarangi Nawaz, Ustad Saidur Rahaman. They were also felicitated on the occasion.Bottom Template Starts
