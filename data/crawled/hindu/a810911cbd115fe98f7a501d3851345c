VSwara Rang Sangeet Samaroh, a programme  in aid of poor kidney patients, was organised in New Delhi recently with a special feature on kidney disease awareness by Dr. Sanjay Gupta of the Nephrology Department of the All India Institute of Medical Sci\u000aences.The main attraction of the evening&#8217;s programme was provided by some Hindustani classical music recitals besides some ancient Oriya compositions and ragas as well.Taking part in the recital, Pandit Hota began the evening&#8217;s programme with raga Jaijaiwanti with each Khayal rendered with the raga&#8217;s basic features and well-tended to. Pandit Hota&#8217;s recital was compact and had polished mannerisms. His renderings of &#8216;taranas&#8217;, &#8216;tribhang&#8217; and &#8216;chaturan&#8217; added further charmto his rendering. He had able accompaniment on the harmonium by Raghunath Sahu and on the tabla and mridangam by Kulmani Sahu.The next piece in raga Desh was a good follow-up. The concluding piece was in Oriya having  affinities with the Hindustani and the Carnatic raga Bhopali and Mohanam respectively.By the way, there are several instances of similar penta-tonic ragas being popular among  musicians. There are a number of ragas devised with the same set of notes. Most of these are branded as different forms of raga Vibhas. There are some Shuddha Kalyan type of ragas like Jait Kalyan and Deshkar, and these could also be handled in a similar manner.JITENDRA PRATAPBottom Template Starts
