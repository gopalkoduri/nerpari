VA tarana echoed with more of the same; these taans opting for subtlety over full-throated projection. Liquid glides defined raag Shyam Kalyan, drawing the listener into reverie. The raga&#8217;s scope for shades and suggestions was well exploited, the interplay between the two madhyams effortlessly creating chiaroscuro. The intensity in the vocalist&#8217;s rendition however, was undermined by the want of power in voice.Turn of phrase benefited from the hand of experience in Vireshwar Madri&#8217;s harmonium support. R. Suresh (tabla) highlighted the main artiste&#8217;s efforts with well-timed succinct rhythmic statements.A wonderfully nuanced alaap in raag Rajeshwari whetted the appetite of connoisseurs in Pandit Janardhan Mitta&#8217;s sitar recital. The scale seemed to project two distinct alternating emotions, with the komal gandhar and shuddha madhyam suggesting yearning and the tivra dhaivat and tivra nishadh conveying joy.Consequently, the captivating lilt expressed a yearning that spoke not of desolation but of anticipation. Deft strokes built atmosphere through tisra and chatusra permutations in the vilambit, enlivened by tabla artiste Chandrajit&#8217;s vibrant interjections. Rich hues seeped into the mosaic as deft fingers flew over frets and strings trapping melody in cunningly laid snares.Maru Behag evoked lyrical imagery in madhya lay elaboration. As always, Malkauns cast its spell in a teen tal piece characterised by dignity and rills of melody.A strong voice ideally suited to making forceful statements guided Mala Ramadorai&#8217;s journey through raag Bhoop, commencing with a short bandish, &#8216;Jab Hi Sab Narapath&#8217; (Tilwada taal) and culminating in the Papanasam Sivan composition, &#8216;Kapali&#8217; in Mohanam.The artiste&#8217;s decision to select ragas common to the Carnatic and Hindustani systems and to sing a kriti after the Hindustani suite was a mark of homage to founder-secretary R. Ramachandran.With clear reach down to the mandrasaptak gandhar, the vocalist built up a relaxed ambience with firm footholds in the rishabh and gandhar.The Madhya laya progressed with swara passages while the dhrut, &#8216;Kel Tha Tha Dhoom&#8217; describing Holi play trailed long strands of taans.Raag Purya Dhanasree was a neat presentation with the madhya lay bandish (teen tal) &#8216;Mushkil Karo Asan&#8217; invoking the grace of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti.Poignancy flavoured the sojourn and the pancham-varja passages at the dhaivath.The thread of continuity running through articulation and pause was the strong point of the jap taal composition and dhrut in the Abhogi narrative followed by Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Sri Lakshmi Varaham&#8217;. Raag Sohini with uttarang pradhan sung in the tara saptak was illustrated by full-throated resonant passages in &#8216;Aeri Yashodha To Se&#8217; that led to Lalithadasar&#8217;s &#8216;Pavanaguru&#8217; in Hamsanandi.Ravindra Khote (harmonium) filled pauses with insightful phrasing. Uday Karpur&#8217;s tabla accompaniment proved the ideal percussive foil for the vocalist&#8217;s melodic flights.
