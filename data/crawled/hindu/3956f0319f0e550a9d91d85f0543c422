VIt was an evening of nostalgia as B. Jayashree, the new Director of Nataka Karnataka Rangayana and her  Spandana troupe opened up a box of stage music and showered theatre songs on their audience in Mysore recently.Ranging from the heydays of professional theatre in the early 20th Century to the early 21st Century,  the songs brought back memories of a bygone era of professional theatre to Mysoreans.It is not often that one gets to hear compositions of P. Kalinga Rao, B.V. Karanth, C. Ashwath, Chandrashekhar Kambara, Anjana Puri among others on the same stageKnown for her rustic voice Jayashree started the recital with a very subdued &#8220;Shree Gajavadana, Girija Nandana&#8221; from the play &#8220;Lakshapati Rajana Kathe&#8221;. The team followed it up with peppier songs from &#8220;Jokumaraswamy&#8221; written by Kambara, &#8220;Hayavadana&#8221; by Girish Karnad&#8220;Manthara&#8221;, written by H. S. Venkatesha Murthy. The songs were rendered in true theatrical style.It was a dual experience for the audience as Jayashree is someone to be seen and heard &#8212; the actor and a singer in her came alive on stage and it was difficult to say what she was better at.People have almost forgotten the &#8220;Seesa Padya&#8221; and &#8220;Kanda Padya&#8221;, rich in their classical value and a strong tradition in theatre &#8212; these were particularly highlighted at the concert. Jayashree sung them with ease and made the audience recall &#8220;Kurukshetra&#8221; and &#8220;Krishna Leela&#8221;, still revered as classics in professional theatre.Parameshwaraiah, who played the harmonium, is considered the walking encyclopaedia on professional theatre. His renditions of the &#8220;Kanda Padya&#8221; enthralled the audience. &#8220;Indina Vaara Shubha Vaara&#8221; rendered by Jayashree and second lead voice of the troupe Rohini Raghunandan was appreciated.Jayashree&#8217;s trademark song &#8220;Saavirada sharanavva karimaayi taaye...&#8221; in a charged-up tone accompanied by just a chande (drum) in the background, conveyed the full import of the final dance of a goddess.Adulation poured in, in the form of garlands, standing ovations, and requests. Some asked for &#8220;Gajavada Herambha&#8221; from &#8220;Hayavadana&#8221;, while others demanded &#8220;Taaya karulina kareya keli&#8221; from &#8220;Dashaavataraa&#8221;, directed and staged by Gubbi Veeranna.The team did not disappoint anyone. Occasionally, the audience were treated to songs from company theatre too.A senior citizen rushed to meet Jayashree after the programme and thurst Rs.101 into Jayashree&#8217;s hands &#8212; a very &#8220;Company&#8221; style of appreciation indeed!The programme was organised by Sugama Sangeeta Academy Trust, Mysore. The Academy headed by well known sugama sangeetha singer H.R. Leelavathi is celebrating its silver jubilee this year.
