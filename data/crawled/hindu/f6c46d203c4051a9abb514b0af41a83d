VThat weekend belonged to T.M. Krishna. The two concerts at Parthasarathy Swami Sabha and Kalarasana, the latter a four-hour affair - provided the Carnatic rasika a sumptuous fare, the fundamental aspect of which was the very high degree of inventiveness - manodharma.Both concerts were outstanding, the music authoritative, falling upon the audience in a thunderous downpour. Yet one must say that the Brindavana Saranga pallavi he sang for PSS at the request of a rasika, outclassed all the other pieces if only for its deep, emotive appeal.The leisurely alapana was gilded with Hindustani touches and due to paucity of time the tanam was shared by the vocalist and the violinist, H.N. Bhaskar. The pallavi, &#8216;Parimala Ranga Pathe,' brought in memories of Madurai Mani Iyer, especially when Krishna plunged into Kanada in the swara-phase (as well as Behag and Madhyamavati).Kanada was also the main raga for the RTP in the second concert. The pallavi (&#8216;Chitsabayil Nadamaadum Deivame') was set to a complex kanda jaathi triputa tala, with the &#8216;take' after nine beats.Unlike the Brindavana Saranga of the previous day, the Kanada RTP was full-fledged, replete with tala exercises.The accompanists were no small artists &#8211; R.K. Sriram Kumar on the violin, maestro Tiruchi Sankaran on the mridangam and B.S. Purushothaman on the ganjira - still there were a few occasions where Krishna was the only one performing. On the whole, the RTP was a thrilling experience.Inventive and movingIf the two pallavis were the highlights of the two concerts, the next best two were the stunning Mukhari (&#8216;Enta Ninne of Tyagaraja') of the first and the exquisite Thodi (&#8216;Vazhimaraitirukkudhe' of Gopalakrishna Bharati) of the second. One expected the Mukhari to be emotional &#8211; it was not but nevertheless was rich in inventiveness. The Thodi, however, was moving. &#8216;Vazhimarithirukkude,' was of the same construct as Tyagaraja's &#8216;Koluva Maragadha.' The niraval, at &#8216;Utru Parka Satrey Vilagado Maadu,' especially was poignant.The central pieces of the two concerts were Kalyani and Bhairavi (&#8216;Talli Ninnu' and &#8216;Sari Evaramma,' both of Syama Sastri), respectively.While the alapana and the song-rendition were good, Krishna's brilliance came to the fore in the niraval and swaras. The Kalyani piece was tailed by some 40 brilliantly imagined single-avartana swaras sequences. As for the Bhairavi, Krishna sang a huge niraval at the pallavi line, delivered in high speed, which the audience lapped up.The only &#8216;well...okay' kind of piece of the two concerts was the Yamuna Kalyani (&#8216;Jambupathe' of Dikshitar). The splendid alapana was briga-less, leisurely delivered. Sriramkumar, who was brilliant throughout and equal to Krishna in niraval and swaras, seemed to be at pains here to keep clear off Kalyani, while playing the alapana. &#8216;Jambupathe' went on too long for comfort, but perhaps Krishna selected it because the composition that expansive could be accommodated only in a four-hour concert.Guruvayoor Dorai and Anirudh Atreya provided percussive support at Parthasarathy Swami Sabha.
