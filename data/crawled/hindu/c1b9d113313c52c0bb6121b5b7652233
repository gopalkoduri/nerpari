A number of his disciples  participated in the festival.The vocal recitals of Swarnima on the inaugural evening, Ghulam Abbas Khan on the second and  Mazhar and Jawed  Ali on the concluding evening stole the show. A gifted disciple of Sabri Khan, Swarnima has an M. Phil. degree in music from Delhi University and has earlier learned under Shubha Mudgal and Vasudev Deshpande. Opening her performance with an imposing Puria Dhanashri, she was equally impressive in the light classical vein, when she sang a lilting dadra &#8220;Bali umar larkaiyaan&#8230;&#8221; in raga Khamaj. The intricate treatment of the concluding tappa also vouched for her soundtaleemand sincereriyaaz.  Mehmood Dhaulpuri on the harmonium, Suhail Yusuf Khan on the sarangi and Shailendra Mishra on the tabla gave her inspired support. The evening opened with a tabla recital by Zameer Ahmad Khan and Haseen Ahmad Khan, who played Teen tala.Ghulam Abbas Khan who began his vocal recital with a spacious Yaman, is the grandson of Mushtaq Hussain Khan and son and disciple of Ghulam Sadiq Khan.

His virtuoso performance was impressive and vouched for his sound training. The stimulating support on the sarangi by Kamal Sabri, the harmonium by Mehmood Dhaulpuri and the tabla by Prasoon Chatterjee enhanced his impressive performance.The evening witnessed a scintillating sarangi trio of Shaminder Pal Singh, Suhail Yusuf Khan and Aslam Khan, all three dedicated disciples of Sabri Khan, who regaled the audience taking turns during the melodious alap and a comely composition in raga Maru Bihag, set to Teen tala. The concluding day saw Mazhar and Jawed Ali casting their spell on the audience.Meanwhile, Sargam presented an evening of music from the Patiala gharana at the Amaltas hall of the Habitat Centre the other day. Patiala gayaki has its own unique charm, especially when it comes from Ajoy Chakrabarti. Ajoy opened with a beautiful bada khayal &#8220;Kaanan mon karnaphool&#8221; set to vilambit Ek tala in raga Bihag, followed by rainbow hued bandishes in the same raga, including the Dhrupad ang composition of Tagore, the lovely &#8220;Neha chhal chhal&#8221; and &#8220;Jhoom jhaam&#8221;.  Ajoy proved his distinction of being a versatile vocalist equally proficient in classical and light classical when he sang the Bangla geet in Kirwani and the concluding Bhairavi thumri, treating the audience to an exemplary display of Patiala gayaki. Indranil&#8217;s tabla and Brajeshwar Mukherjee&#8217;s superb vocal and harmonium support did his guru proud.Loveleena Kumar, a young and talented disciple of Munnawar Ali Khan, was the earlier artiste who presented khayals in Rageshri, sufiana kalam and a dadra in raga Pahadi.
