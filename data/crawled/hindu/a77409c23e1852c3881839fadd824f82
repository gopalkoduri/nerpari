VHARISH BALAmple variety in compositions and rhythmic patterns make Sriram Gangadhar's performances memorable. His recent concert at Vaikom Vasudevan Nair memorial concert for Poornathrayeesa Sangeeth Sabha at Thripunithura is a case in point.The `Pranamamyaham,' Mysore Vasudevachar kriti in Gowlai raga received a fair treatment withjhanda swarapassages in theswara prasthara.His Pantuvarali alaapana touched the upper rishabham from where he thrilled the audience with dazzlingbrigas. For `Ennaganu Ramabhajana,' Sriram's swaras took the same pattern ofjhandasandkorvais.Treat forrasikasAttukal Balasubramanian, the violinist, excelled in his Pantuvarali rendition as he held base on the panchamam and took glides to essential sancharas in the raga. `Brochevarevarura,' the Kamas composition, rarely sung these days in concerts, was fairly well presented.   The vocalist was was well supported by Vaikom Venu on the mridangam.Sriram then took the audience by surprise by going in for a longalaapanain Andolika raga, touching the swaras in straight notes. `Ragasudharasa,' which has featured in a Malayalam movie,  was warmly welcomed by the audience.After `Marukelara O Raghava,' in Jayanthasree raga, the vocalist chose Kalayani for the bestalaapanain the concert.He came up with some soothing phrases that revolved around the upper gandharam.The vocalist chose most of his lighter numbers in `madhyama sthayi.' `Broohi mukundethi,' in Kurinji raga, which emphasises the importance of chanting the name of the Lord; and `Radhasametha Krishna' in Yamuna Kalyani were pleasant ripples of musical expression.`Dikku theriyatha kattil,' a ragamalika and `Samarasabhavana,' a patriotic song in raga Abheri brought the concert to a close.Bottom Template Starts
