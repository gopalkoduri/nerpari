VIn the Krishna Gana Sabha Gokulashtami series, Neyveli Santhanagopalan stuck to his recent kutcheri pattern of uniform uninterrupted lethargy, without any high or low in tonal manipulation. His debilitated voice had compelled him to resort to his eas\u000ay-going method of skimming the surface without depth.Some years ago, he showed great promise but now he could hardly do it again and so looked a shadow of his past. He was at ease in madhya sthayi but the tara sthayi shadja was his Lakshmanrekha, beyond which he had to negotiate in sporadic forays cautiously. He could not make the same fluid flow of sancharas which led him to compromises to come to terms with his fractured voice. His raga development was bit by bit without any free-style sancharas, almost in the nature of lisping. His particular style and musical content spoke of the different values and creativity he was after.One notable aspect was brevity in unfolding the ragas in alapanas which included characteristic rakti pidis of Ananda Bhairavi, Ranjani and Kedaragowla he elaborated. He pampered his voice to present an image of mellowness.The selection of kirtanas was good. &#8216;Merusamana&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla), &#8216;Sujana Jeevana&#8217; (Kamas), &#8216;O! Jagadamba&#8217; (Ananda Bhairavi), &#8216;Dunmargachara&#8217; (Ranjani) and &#8216;Saraguna Palimpa&#8217; (Kedaragowla). These songs have an inbuilt quality to uplift a performance. He presented himself as a vidwan who knew precisely what interpretative method would click with the listeners with the state of his voice.A vocalist needs good accompanists to make a success of a kutcheri. Santhanagopalan has Vittal Ramamurthy on the violin, Vellore Ramabhadran on the mridangam and Srirangam Kannan (morsing). They saw to it that they never interfered with Santhanagopalan&#8217;s pace and pattern.
