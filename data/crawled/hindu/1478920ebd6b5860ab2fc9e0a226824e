VChaitra Sairam of Chennai in the company of artistes of about her same age group between 25 and 30, rendered a vocal recital for Visakha Music and Dance Academy at Kalabharathi recently. The trio made it a delicious treat of classicism. After intense training in Carnatic vocal from renowned vocalist Bombay Jayashree, Chaitra began singing in public along with her and soon became a graded artiste of Akashvani.A.G. Venkata Subrahmaniyam\u000aand Delhi Sairam also\u000afrom Chennai were the artistes\u000awho kept excellent\u000acompany on violin and mridangam\u000arespectively.After rendering Todi Adi\u000aTala Varnam in the two tempos\u000awith brief alapana and\u000aswaram, she rendered Ambi\u000aDixithar's Ganapathe (Kalyani)\u000awith sweet alapana and\u000aswaram. Then after devoutly\u000arendering Sree Mathrubhootham\u000aof Deekshitar (Misra\u000aEka, Kannada), she nicely\u000aelaborated Syamasundaranga\u000aof Tyagaraja (Dhyanyasi) with\u000ascholarly alapana, neravu and\u000aswaram in the two tempos.Syama Sastry's Paalinchukamakshi\u000a(Madhyamavathi)\u000anext, was marked with scholarly\u000aexpression of manodharma\u000aby way of alapana that\u000abrought out the intricacies of\u000aragabhava, neravu and swaram\u000ain the two tempos\u000awhich fortified the Sahitya\u000aSangeethabhavas embedded\u000ain the composition. Similar\u000awas the Ragam, Thanam and\u000aPallavi (Devi Sree Raja Rajeswari,\u000aSankaree Tripura\u000aSundari) in Ranjani set to\u000aJhampe taalam in Khandanada.\u000aThe concluding swaram\u000arendered in ragamalika\u000aconstituted of Sreeranjani\u000aand Amrithavarshini stood\u000atestimony for her command\u000aon the attributes of different\u000ascales of music. Subrahmaniyam\u000aon violin and Sairam on\u000amridangam while following\u000aand playing their turns enhanced\u000athe grandeur. Dulcet\u000arendering of a bhajan in\u000aSindhubhairavi and a thillana\u000aconstituted the lilting\u000atailpiece.
