VRadhika Balakrishna sang at Alwar Kala\u000aBhavana in Mysore. Shri Krishna\u000aSeva Samithi Charitable Trust and\u000athe State Bank of Mysore had jointly\u000aorganised this concert as part of the Hanuma\u000aJayanti celebrations. Sangeetha (violin)\u000aand Vadiraj (mridanga) accompanied the\u000asinger.The young vocalist sang with unflinching\u000averve, and her command overarticulation\u000aled her to success even while passing\u000athrough intricate movements, generally\u000avulnerable to discrepancies.Nevertheless, she ignored one area necessary\u000afor airing melodic movements -\u000athorough honing of her vocal abilities for\u000aproviding consistency in volume and\u000atimbre. The above shortcoming had repercussions\u000aon other areas of the concert too:\u000aclarity, expressions and experience. The\u000alyrics frequently suffered with slurred accents,\u000arendering them difficult to grasp, in\u000aspite of lively progressions.Take for example "Sudhamayi Sudhanidhi"\u000a(Amrithavarshini - Muthayya Bhagavathar).\u000aShe expatiated the raga with\u000arecognisable imagination and ease. The\u000agraces were crisp and deep even in the\u000ataara sthayi sancharas.Yet, just for want of polished intonations\u000aand controlled volume her endeavour\u000acould not reach the expected goal. In these\u000aareas, the young violinist's (new entrant)\u000amovements imparted melody, though at\u000atimes technically there appeared a few\u000aweak links, for lack of experience than of\u000aexpertise.More or less on similar grounds, other\u000apresentations like "Vidamu Seyave" (Kharaharapriya\u000a- Thyagaraja) and "Ethavunara"\u000a(Kalyani - Thyagaraja - the focus of\u000athe concert with a neraval at "Shrikarudagu"\u000aand other standard ingredients) entertained\u000athe audience.Throughout, the young percussionist exhibited\u000ahis gentleness and composure, and\u000atreated the listeners with his melodic passages.* * *S. Shankar sang in commemoration of P.G.\u000aLakshminarayana, an acclaimed personality\u000ain the field of percussion. Students and\u000afriends of the luminary had arranged this\u000aprogramme at the Vasudevacharya Bhavana.\u000aRamani's voice harmonised with the\u000aveteran enhancing the overall impact. The\u000amood-elevating retinue consisted H.N.\u000aBhaskar (violin), Arjun Kumar (mridanga),\u000aS. Manjunath (ghata) and T.A. Ramanuja\u000a(morsing). The mature singer carried the\u000alisteners into the woods of good music,\u000awherein one could enjoy and appreciate\u000athe essences of the ragas unalloyed, and the\u000aimports of the lyrics undistorted. "Shri Mahaganapathe\u000aSurapathe" in Naata and\u000a"Ninne Nammithinayya" (Simhendramadhyama\u000a- Vasudevacharya) elevated the hall\u000ato an ethereal climactic altar. He treated\u000athe ragas with scholarly elaborations and\u000aplaced the rich lyrics before the audience\u000awith meanings melodically exposed.Shankar maintains uniform and sustained\u000awarmth, irrespective of different\u000astages of the concert. Command over voice\u000aand control over his breath would render\u000athe beginnings and the endings of the sangathis\u000asmooth and fine.For the above reasons Vasudevachar's\u000a"Bhajare Maanasa" (Abheri) and Dikshitar's\u000atwo compositions, "Shri Guruguha"\u000a(Devakriya) and "Shri Venkatesham" (Kalyanavasantha),\u000asimply mesmerised the listeners.\u000a"O Rangashayi" (Kamboji -\u000aThyagaraja) was the focus, which included\u000aa detailed alapana, a lilting neraval at "Bhuloka\u000aVaikunkta", and a thani avarthana that\u000aexposed all the percussionists' individual\u000aand collective grit. The violinist Bhaskar's\u000areciprocations and extempore perfectly\u000amatched the lead artiste's imaginations\u000aand intentions.
