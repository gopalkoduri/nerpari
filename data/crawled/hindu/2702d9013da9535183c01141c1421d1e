VSri Rama Navami celebrations, organised by the Sringeri Mutt, Srirangam, provided an opportunity for up-and-coming artists to prove their talent.The vocal concert of Ishwarya Vidhya Ragunath, which formed part of the &#8216;Sri Rama Navami Sangeetha Mahotsavam' stood out for lucidity the young artist possesses in handling the kirtanas. Simplicity also marked her performance all through.Semmangudi's formulaAppreciating her endeavour, one of the speakers, N. Gopalasamy, director, Dalmia Cements, said that Ishwarya Vidhya Ragunath's style reminded him of the popular Semmangudi's formula. Her concert kept the audience in rapt attention all through. &#8216;Deva Deva,' the Swati Tirunal kriti, in Roopaka talam was followed by &#8216;Vandhanam Raghunandhanam,' in Sahana set to Adi talam. This Tyagaraja kirtana formed one of the sub-mains of the concert.The main song of the concert was Tyagaraja's &#8216;Eti Janmamithi?' in Varali ragam set to Misra Chapu talam. Salem K. Srinivasan on the mridangam and T.H. Vasantha on the violin lent able support.&#8216;Dhava Thasogam,' again a Tyagaraja kriti, in Varali ragam set to Adi talam and &#8216;Kelathi Mama Hirudaye,' the Sadasiva Brahmmendrar kriti in Atana ragam, Adi talam, were other attractions.She learnt has the nuances of music through diligent practice under mentors in the order of Seethalakshmi Venkatesan, Vegavagini Vijayaraghavan.
