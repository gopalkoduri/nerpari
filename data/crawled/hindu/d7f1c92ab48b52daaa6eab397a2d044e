VSadinchaneTrichur Ramachandran and Charumathi RamachandranCarnatic Classical - Rs. 120Beginning with Purandara Dasa&#8217;s &#8216;Jaya Jaya&#8217; in Nattai with swaras, a kuraippu in the Panchamam culminating in a rhythmic sequence  is well worth listening time.The Pancharatna kritis of Tyagaraja enjoy a monumental stature.  The pair has  articulated &#8216;Sadinchene&#8217; with clarity and sensibility.The sloka &#8216;Vandematharam&#8217; in Hindolam has a firm grip on the connoisseur&#8217;s psyche. The raga response by Parur M.S.Anantharaman transcends the morbidity of mere playing technique.G.N.Balasubramanian&#8217;s &#8216;Sama Gana Lole&#8217; embellished with imaginative kalpanaswara and the delineation of raga Karnataka Devagandhari at length by both musicians in the various octaves, are  innovative within a basic orthodoxy. Abheri sports a suddhadhaivatam according to the kritis composed by Dikshitar (&#8216;Veenabheri&#8217;), Syama Sastri (&#8216;Ninnu Vina Marigalada&#8217;) Papanasam Sivan (&#8216;Kanda Vandarul&#8217;). &#8216;Kayarohaneswaram&#8217; and &#8216;Panchasatpeetha,&#8217; Dikshitar&#8217;s songs with a chatusruti dhaivatam are in Devagandaram, but has the same arohana and avarohana format as Karnataka Devagandhari, as also Suddhananda Bharatiar&#8217;s &#8220;Eppadi Padinaro.&#8221; One feels it would be more precise for the melody that has the chatursruti dhaivatam to be given the nomenclature Karnataka Devagandhari.Mysore Vasudevacharya&#8217;s &#8216;Bhajare Manasa&#8217; is an interpretation rich in aesthetics and lyrical involvement. The swaras  are presented with an easy melodic flow.  The divisions and subdivisions in the panchamam are meticulously constructed. The Malavi composition, &#8216;Nenarunchinaanu&#8217; of Tyagaraja, &#8216;Govardhana Giridhara&#8217; of Narayana Tirtha  and &#8216;Karanam Kettu Vadi&#8217; of Suddhananda Bharati, (mentioned as a Sivan creation in the inlay card), are eloquent expressions of mellifluent music.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
