VThe host of concerts that marked the celebrations of the 59th anniversary of Sri Satguru Sangeetha Samajam was rounded off by more music. Ranjani and Gayathri began with &#8216;Rama Nee Pai' in Kedaram and continued to beseech Devadi Deva Rama in the words of Tyagaraja in the Atana kriti, &#8216;Balakanakameya.' In keeping with their avowal to explore rare ragas, Ranjani delineated Ramapriya at length, and with considerable artistry, to the mellow accompaniment provided by Mysore Srikant on the violin, for Patnam Subramania Iyer's &#8216; Korina Varamu.' Their &#8216; Eppadi Manam Thunindhado' brought out Sita's emotions as expounded by Arunachala Kavirayar.Gayathri handled the alapana in Khamboji with deftness for Dikshitar's &#8216; Maragathavalli.' Veteran K.V. Prasad on the mridangam was in fine form and played with subtle artistry and N. Guruprasad on the ghatam played with brilliant tonal clarity. The RTP in Reetigowlai was an excellent exposition.Nithyasree sang rarely heard ragas such as Vanaspati (&#8216; Pariya Shakamata' --Tyagaraja), Janaranjani, (&#8216;Smarane Sukhe' &#8211; Tyagaraja), Madhyamavarali (&#8216;Narayananai' &#8211; Narayana Tirtha) and Malavi (&#8216;Nenarunchi' &#8211; Tyagaraja) to make a hit with her fans who thronged Lakshmi Sundaram hall.She began with the Pantuvarali varnam, &#8216;Sami Ninne,' and also sang Dikshitar's &#8216; Soundararajam' in Brindavana Saranga and Sivan's &#8216; Maal Maruganai' in Vasantha. Her main raga was Kalyani, which she delved into with comfortable ease and command. M. A. Krishnasamy on the violin provided ample support. I. Sivakumar on the mridangam and Alathur Rajaganesh on the ganjira gave percussive support.&#8216;Kanda Nee Oru' by Thiruppur Swaminathan in Ahirbhairavi, popularised by her was among the final pieces, as also &#8216;Rama Rama Ena,' by Prayaga Rangadasa in Sindubhairavi. &#8216;Kottai Kattade' in Mohanam and the thillana in Revathi made for an interesting finish.Quality and creativitySrivalsan J. Menon, relatively unfamiliar to the Madurai rasikas, made a positive impression with his deep voice and excellent pronunciation of the lyrics.His accompanist, C. K. Ramanujacharyulu's niraval right from the strident Vasantha varnam, &#8216; Ninnu Kori,' was of a very high standard. The chittaiswarams for Veenai Kuppaiyar's &#8216;Vinayaka' in Hamsadhwani gave momentum to the beginning. Palladam Ravi on the mridangam made small changes in the eduppu and added quality to the creative sections of the Sriraga mangala kriti, &#8216; Kamalamba' by Dikshitar. His alapana in Sankarabharanam kept everyone guessing about the main song to be sung when he surprised them with Ramanathan Krishnan's &#8216;Akshaya Lingam.'Interesting variationsEmbar S. Kannan played several songs on the violin without spending too much time on alapanas and improvisations on the swaras. With the simple and sparing support of Mannargudi A. Eswaran on the mridangam and Tiruchi S. Krishnan on the ghatam, he began with the auspicious Mallari in Gambeeranattai, and played Jeyachamaraja Wodeyar's &#8216;Sri Mahaganapathim' in Atana. When he played Patnam Subramanya Iyer's much-liked &#8216;Raghu Vamsa Sudha' in Kadanakuthuhalam, he made some amusing variations in the niraval and entertained the audience. His next song was the touching kriti in Devagandhari by Gopalakrishna Bharati beginning, &#8216; Enneramum,' where the feeling of devotion intrinsic to the song was brought out by Kannan's clear exposition of all the syllables in the lyrics. The pallavi, &#8216;Va Guha Shanmuga,' was very well played although the ragam and tanam were short.Host of percussionistsAttired in gorgeous green silk and ornate kurta, Kadri Gopalnath accepted the award of Madhura Kala Praveena and then presented a short concert with A. Kanyakumari on the violin. The percussive crew included B. Harikumar on the mridangam, Rajendra Nakod on the tabla and Bangalore B. Rajasekar on the morsing. He played one of Tyagaraja's pancharatna kritis, &#8216;Entaro Mahanubhavulu,' in Sriragam, and set the pace for the concert. Kanyakumari adapted her play to that of the style of the saxophone just as Nakod adjusted his tabla to suit the sharp beats of the Harikumar's mridangam.The liveliness picked up with Tyagaraja's &#8216;Nagumomu' in Abheri, when the instrumentalists took turns to do niraval in the charanam, as in a jugalbandhi. Though the morsing was not heard in the midst of so many instruments, he played his solo parts to the satisfaction of the listeners. Kadri took pains to reveal the nuances of the rarely played raga, &#8216; Surya' and played ragam and tanam to the pallavi, &#8216;Meenalochani,' bringing the series of concerts to a colourful conclusion. The pallavi, a Tirukkural beginning, &#8216; Paniyumam,' stood out for its originality. In this as well as in the thukkadas such as Sivan's &#8216;Nambi Kettavar' in Hindolam and Bharatiyar's &#8216; Pagaivanukkarulvay' in ragamalika, the sisters were fastidious in their pronunciation of words in Tamil and in drawing out the powerful feelings expressed in the lyric.(Concluded)
