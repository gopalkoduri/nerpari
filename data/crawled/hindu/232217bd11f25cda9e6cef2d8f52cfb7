VT. K. GANAPATHYBombay Jayashree's  total involvement and commitment in a kutcheri establish her  as a sensitive and refined artiste. Her  recital  in memory of the late Neelaveni Thayarammal at Mani High School, Coimbatore, was ample demonstration of how her music is a synthesis of elegance and silkiness.Melodious lyricismJayashree's lyricism  was melodiously sanguine throughout the concert, free of  frills and gimmicks. "Deva Deva Jagadeeswara" (Poorvikalyani), the opening song, was chaste with sarvalaghu swaras reflecting raga bhava followed by "Sogasujuda Tharama" in Kannadagowlai. The Devagandhari raga alapana  revealed her tremendous vocal balance with good gana naya. Her  passion in negotiating tharasthayi sancharas  in the raga vinyasam of Lalitha added to the charm of the presentation of Hiranmayi with lilting swaras. Her spirited exploration of Surati raga with effective voice modulation in the higher octaves and the charming presentation of the kriti, "Sree Venkatagireesam Aasraye" with neraval and swaras drew wide acclaim.Kharaharapriya, the main raga of the concert, was expanded with breathtaking prayogas, weighty sancharas and meaningful karvais for the kriti, "Rama Nee Samaanamevaru."The recital concluded  with evocative tukkadas.  Srikanth excelled on the violin in his picturisation of ragas Lalitha, Surati and Kharaharapriya as well as in the swara repartees. Sateeshkumar (mridangam) and Rajeshkumar (kanjira) provided flashy beats while embellishing the songs. Their tani was replete with variegated methods of rhythmic patterns.Bottom Template Starts
