VAnnaNagar Music Circle Trust featured two concerts at Chinmaya Vidyalaya. Anantha Narayanan on the veena faced the professional dilemma of time (60 minutes in this case) versus quality, but emphasised that he was all for classicism.  He commenced wit\u000ah Varanamukhava (Koteeswara Iyer, Hamsadhwani) and then gave a rare piece &#8216;Saradhe Veena Visharadhe&#8217; (Sivan, Devagandhari).Then it was his turn to bring out the fine facets of Mayamalavagowla (Deva Deva &#8211; Swathi Thirunal). &#8216;Orachoopu&#8217; (Kannadagowla, Tyagaraja) followed and one relished with singular delight the phrase &#8220;O Raghoothama&#8221; as many times as it was played. The raga alapanas for Dhanyasi (&#8216;Sangeetha Gnanamu,&#8217; Tyagaraja) and Kalyani (&#8216;Vasudevayani,&#8217; Tyagaraja), and the kriti rendering added value to the knowledge of the audience.  Swaraprastharam seemed to have been measured ideally to suit the hour-long duration of the kutcheri.Anantha Narayanan signed off with a Thiruppugazh. Mannarkoil Balaji provided mridangam support like a touch artiste. There was not the slightest intention to drown the veena and it was complete understanding  from start to finish.Performing in the prime slot, Sankari Krishnan proved her mettle.  Starting with a Varnam in Shanmukapriya (Lalgudi Jayaraman), she sang &#8216;Mahaganapathim&#8217; (Naatai, Muthuswamy Dikshitar) as the next number. The way in which the Mukhari alapana (&#8216;Endraikku Sivakrupai,&#8217; Neelakanta Sivan) was approached and the anupallavi eduppu, &#8216;Kandrin Kuralai Kettu,&#8217; brought alive the  sensitive spirit of the kriti.A breezy &#8216;Padumanabhan Maruga&#8217; (Nagaswaravali-Papanasam Sivan) came as a prelude to &#8216;Seshachala Nayakam&#8217; (Varali, Muthuswamy Dikshitar) where alapana, niraval and swaras were sung with intensity and depth &#8211; and obviously with remarkable control. But one really had a silent wish that with this voice of hers she could have attempted the niraval at &#8216;MandhahasaVadhanam&#8217; instead of  &#8216;Aravindha Pathra Nayanam.&#8217;Durga Devi (Navarasa Kannada, Harikesanallur Muthaiah Bahgavathar) was the next neat filler. The main number was Rama Katha Sudha (Madyamavathi, Tyagaraja) and as she began Rama Katha in the lower octave she seemed to again signal that her voice had a captivating power even at the lower segment.Sankari showcased her potential with a Ragam-Thanam-Pallavi in Kalyani (Khanda Jampa Khanda Nadai). The forty akshara pallavi was an exercise in confidence and the procedural rounds (kramam) were traditionally rendered. The fare also included a Thillana (Khamas, Lalgudi Jayaraman) and a Tiruppugazh (Hamir Kalyani).Sankari Krishnan should take care to see that attempts at subtle  modulation do not make her voice inaudible.  Padma Shanker on the violin cohered well with the main artiste and showed her artistic potential during the alapanas that were steeped in aesthetics and gave fine calculative support with a liberal round of reply swaras. Mannarkoil Balaji (mridangam) and Tiruchi Murali (ghatam) showed a keen sense of anticipation that extended not merely to the swaraprastharam level but also to the niraval. They meshed well during the main thani and  the interlude after the complicated pallavi.Bottom Template Starts
