VSeetha Rajan&#8217;s concert on  Sunday last was as cool as the morning,  when  the sun played hide and seek  even at 9 a.m.  Sore throat troubled her  in the mandhara stayi sancharas but  the tara stayi found her traversing  with ease.&#8216;Nada Thanumanisham&#8217; was a  faithful rendition, with a smooth flow of sarva laghu swaras. She took up niraval in &#8216;Kalamuna Sobhillu&#8217; (&#8216;Meru Samanamevaru&#8217;- Mayamalava gowlai &#8211; Adi - Tyagaraja) with a liberal dose of purposeful swaras. B. U. Ganesh Prasad followed her like a shadow and excelled equally in both segments.With Patri Satish Kumar on the mridangam what more can you ask for? Adjusting himself to the main artist&#8217;s style, it was a deft and telling stroke play like tennis ace Ramanthan Krishnan&#8217;s. The myriad patterns he wove were a connoisseur&#8217;s delight. Anandabhairavi alapana (&#8216;Marivere Gati Evvaramma&#8217; &#8211; Mishram &#8211; Syama Sastri)) was replete with phrases soaked in true sampradaya. Ganesh Prasad&#8217;s assets &#8212;  clean bowing and poise &#8212; made him noticeable in his replies.&#8216;Govardhana Gireesham&#8217; (Hindolam &#8211; Adi - Dikshitar) was followed by a detailed essay of Kalyani. The cascade of phrases she unleashed in the upper octaves was impressive.She adorned the powerful &#8216;Kamalamba&#8217; navavarnam with a garland of swaras that exhibited the raga&#8217;s beauty sans arithmetic.&#8216;Aravinda Pada Malar&#8217; was preceded by the sloka &#8216;Kasturi Tilakam&#8217; in ragas Karaharpriya, Varali, Sahana and Kapi. The delineations of both Seetha Rajan and Ganesh bore the classical stamp.Seetha Rajan&#8217;s concert was followed by Sangeethanjali by the students of P. S. Narayanaswamy. Group singing always brings out the best of a kriti&#8217;s bhavam. Bhakti flavour takes the front seat and group dynamics comes into play.The result: rasikas are left in an exalted mood. All these were evident when the groups performed.Ranjani-Gayathri, Amrutha Murali, Radha Parthasarathy, Swathi Srikrishna,Vasumathi Desikan, Bharathy Ramasubban, Mythreyi, Ramakrishnan, Balamuralikrishna, Madhavan, Abhishek Raghuram, Anirudh, Aditya Prakash, Akshay, M. R. Subramanian and Siddharth sang together &#8216;Intha Paraka,&#8217; &#8216;Lokavana Chathura,&#8217; &#8216;Srikanthaneeyada,&#8217; &#8216;Neekaydaya,&#8217; &#8216;Nama Kusuma&#8217; and &#8216;Sapashya.&#8217; Sangeethanjali was continued by disciples of V. Subramanian &#8211; the first half by female students and second by the males.Maya, Chitra, Srinidhi, Savitha, Jyothi and Usha rendered &#8216;Brochevarevaray,&#8217; &#8216;Suryamurthe,&#8217; &#8216;Ardhnareeswaram,&#8217; &#8216;Kripaya Palaya&#8217; and &#8216;Appan Avadaritha,&#8217; while Rajeev, Hariprasad, Shankar and Sashi teamed up with gusto to present &#8216;Maha Ganapathe,&#8217; &#8216;Meenakshi maymudham,&#8217; &#8216;Pahimam Sri Rajarajeswari&#8217; and &#8216;Nama Kusuma.&#8217;
