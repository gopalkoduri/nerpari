VThe Gunidas festival burst into the music scene four years ago, to commemorate the memory of the erudite musician, Pandit C.R. Vyas. At the latest edition of the festival, Pt. Satish Vyas, son of Pt. Vyas and disciple of santoor maestro Pt. Shiv Kumar Sharma, presented a scintillating santoor performance. Yogesh Samsi, son of Pt. Dinakar Kaikani, accompanied Pt. Vyas on the tabla. The concert was dedicated to the memory of Pt. Dinakar Kaikani, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan and doyenne Gangubai Hangal.Pt. Vyas began with a traditional alaap in Madhuvanti, offering delicate and varying stroke patterns. He employed both quick strokes and elongated notes by dragging the striker over many strings in quick succession; he also used the striker to create a glissando effect that approximated the meend. By varying the accented notes, he created different metrical patterns. Yogesh displayed outstanding tukkdas, tihais, and chakradhars, complementing Pt. Vyas and creating some vibrant moments.Aural pleasureThe Hindustani concert by Pt. Ajoy Chakraborty was a brilliant display of self-expression. The result of Pt. Chakraborty's splendid performance was that, through his music, he created a sublime atmosphere. He has performed on many occasions in the city and every time, he presents something unique that remains long in the minds of music lovers. This time too was no different.The concert began &#8216;Sab Sukh Diyo Mere Kartar' in Rageswari, a favourite of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, in vilambit ektal followed by dhrut teental in &#8216;Begun Ko Gun Banta Data.' Pt. Chakraborty explored badat in mandra with beautiful meends and sargams. It was an out-of-this-world experience &#8212; a reiteration of the sargam by Brijeshwar.In the next bandish, he showcased vakra tans and swaras. The other pieces included &#8216;Sundar nvali naar kar singaar,' a beautiful composition in dhrut teen taal and &#8216;Raag Sang Rageri Mil Mangal Gayen' with tabla bols.Yogesh had ample scope to showcase his skill in the thumri, &#8216;Jiyara Jalaawe' in Manzh Khamaj.The genius of Pt. Chakraborty came to the fore in his elaboration of Manzh Khamaj, which flowed while alluding to several ragas: Jaijaivanti, Miyan ki Malhar, Bilawal and Gaud Sarang.He ended the concert with the famous bandish of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan &#8211; &#8216;Kakaro Sanjni' in Pahari. With a touch of Sindhu Bhairav and Bhairavi, Pt. Ajoy Chakraborty yet again proved that he is one of the most versatile proponents of the Patiala Gharana.
