VShantala Subramaniam has blossomed into a fine  flautist.  She has assimilated the adventurous spirit of her brother, S. Shashank, in concert music. The multi-speed rendering of Sri raga varnam &#8216;Saminine&#8217; showed Shantala&#8217;s  grip ove\u000ar her craft. She went for a detailed expansion of Natta.  The kriti to be rendered was &#8216;Jaya Jaya Janakikanta&#8217; in khanda chapu tala, a kriti of Purandaradasa.A quick sketch  of Sudha Saveri was tagged on to  Tyagaraja&#8217;s composition &#8216;Darini telusu konti.&#8217; A rare raga Kannadagowla was taken up for detailed elaboration, which was challenging for the violinist Viju S. Anand as well. He rose to the occasion and gave his best.Perfect coordination was evident  in the mukathaippu swaras for the kriti &#8216;Sogasajooda tharama&#8217; in Rooopaka tala.  The flautist and  percussion artistes Balakrishna Kamath and Vaikom Gopalakrishnan came good in this kriti.Pantuvarali alaapana was marked by marvellous modulations and the phrases were executed in several speeds. The proper kalapramana for &#8216;Siva Siva yenarada&#8217; made it stand out.The thani was packed with humdrum jathis yet were noteworthy for their precision.  In the last phase of the concert, &#8216;Akhilandeswari rakshamam&#8217; in Dwijavanthi raga stood out for its emotive fervour. There were other compositions such as &#8216;Chinnanchirukiliye&#8217; and a tillana in Khamas that were played with finesse. The flautist chose &#8216;Nadupai Galigeru norulu&#8217; in Madhyamavati as her closing piece.The programme, which was organised by Rasikapriya, also had Pancharatna keertana singing led by N.P. Ramaswamy on the same day.
