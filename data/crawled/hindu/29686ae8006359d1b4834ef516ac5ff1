VVINU VASUDEVAN`Griha Vinika,' an informal gathering of Carnatic music lovers in Thrissur, has become a source of inspiration to many youngsters.The group conducts Carnatic music recitals and lecture demonstrations on different subjects in music four times a year. It all began in October 2001 when a few music buffs decided to get together to conduct concerts.They aimed at holding concerts that would appeal to connoisseurs of music and the first concert was held at Kuzhikkad Mana, near Kunnamkulam, on October 2. Gradually the number of members in the group increased and soon the reputation of the group spread far and wide. Griha Vinika organised the concerts of stalwarts of such as T.K. Govindarao, K.N. Ranganath Sharma, T.H. Subramaniam, and the late Neyyattinkara Mohanachandran.The absence of a committee or office-bearers has not affected the working of the group .  Without any financial assistance or support from any institution or organisations, the group conducts its activities with the help of a annual subscription from the members.Recently, Dr. Seetharajan, a disciple of Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, conducted a three-hour recital for Griha Vinika."One does not get bored while singing for such an audience. The homely atmosphere and the participation of the audience make it a unique experience for musicians," she said.  The group makes it a point to record the concerts and keep the audio CDs for further discussions, thus making it an enviable collection of concerts.Bottom Template Starts
