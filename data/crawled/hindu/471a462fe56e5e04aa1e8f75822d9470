VOne Raga One Kriti - O.S. ThiagarajanDVD; Mudhra Recording Co.MRP Rs. 200.Mudhra has been organising  varied thematic concerts such as &#8216;One raga one kriti&#8217; concerts apart from concerts based on a single composer&#8217;s works, RTP concerts and thukkadas. The DVD under review is  a recording of a live concert by\u000a O. S. Thiagarajan as part of the &#8216;One raga and one kriti&#8217; series held a few years ago. A brief introduction  about ragas and kritis will be helpful for students of Carnatic music.Thiagarajan  chooses Kharaharapriya for alapana. The essay commences from the madhya sthayi in the initial phase and consists of short madhyamakala phrases. The singer&#8217;s voice is in tune with the sruti and this is half the job done well. The sancharas and prayogas are vocalised in a clear fashion with abundant karvais, making the vinyasa session engaging and pleasant.The alapana by seasoned violinist A. Kanyakumari is sheer delight and stands testimony to the long and successful innings she has had as an accompanist and as a solo performer.Thiagarajan winds up his essay of Kharaharapriya in a leisurely manner, giving ample room for mandara sthayi sancharas which register well.What better choice than Tyagaraja&#8217;s monumental &#8216;Chakkani Raja&#8217; for a thematic concert covering one raga and one kriti in Kharaharapriya? The cluster of sangatis is sung with azhutham and creates a tranquil mood.Mridangam vidwan Tiruvarur Bhaktavatsalam&#8217;s  thekas and sollus are tailor-made for the song which enhances aural pleasure. He plays with the right volume, never drowning the niceties of the sangatis.The niraval at &#8216;Kantiki Sundara&#8217; is sung at arai idam from samam. The initial one avartha niraval cycles are sung with variety with equal contribution from the violinist. The kalpanaswaras in both kalams are in the right proportion to the duration taken for the neraval sung. The melkala swara kuraippu at the daivatham is also sung at arai idam from samam flawlessly.The mridangam artist plays only during the violinist&#8217;s replies,  allowing the listener to savour the vocalist&#8217;s voice sans percussive support, which is refreshing. Bhakthavatsalam&#8217;s tani avarthanam replete with chapus, arai chapus and pharans in total alignment with the sruti, is a musical extension of the song and engages the attention of the listener throughout the percussive interlude.
