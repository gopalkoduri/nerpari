VDevotion is an emotion that is beyond our comprehension. The proposed monthly thematic Sadguru Rasanubhava programme of Sri Krishna Gana Sabha seeks to lead rasikas on this devotional path.The proposed series sponsored by Preeta Reddy and P. Vijayakumar Reddy of the late Obul Reddy family, will surely delight Tyagaraja bhaktas.The brief explanation of the message in Saint Tyagaraja's songs before they were rendered at a recent concert highlighted the spiritual dimensions of the compositions.Poise mattersThat poise is supreme in Carnatic music was deeply felt by rasikas when the kirtanas were sung without raga alapanas or the tyranny of swaras. The revelation of the spiritual and aesthetic excellence could be sensed by the rasanubhava pattern of recital which brought out the lofty values found in Tyagaraja's kirtanas.Until now, most musicians understood the beauty of the sangita in Tyagaraja songs but not the sentiments in them. Unmindful of the emotion in the sahitya, the performers got lost in intellectual self-indulgence.The rasanubhava approach serves to throw light on Tyagaraja's legacy. The lyrical magnificence and the spiritual element are the acme of the saint's genius. The sahitya represents the bedrock of Indian culture. How can these ideals be savoured except during a tranquil exposition?Such was the presentation of R. Vedavalli that she brought out the rasanubhava concept. &#8216;Tolinejesina Pujapalameelage' (Kokiladwani) and &#8216;Urakegalkuna Ramuni Bhakti' (Sahana) highlighted this aspect. The pieces &#8216;Etaavuna' (Yadakulakhambodi) and &#8216;Vanaja Nayanudani' (Kedaragowla) were in the nada stuti mode.&#8216;Vidulakumrokkeda' (Mayamalavagowla) was in the nature of obeisance to the sangita parampara. &#8216;Evarani' (Devamritavarshini) is the reiteration of the evolution of Ramanama using a combination of the Panchakshara and Ashtaakshara mantras of Siva and Narayana.&#8216;Emani Maatladithivo' (Thodi) was the main item with a pertinent alapana. In the rendering of the kritis, the emotional aspect was dominant. The recital proclaimed Vedavalli as a great musician, worthy of her stature.The accompanists, R.K. Sriramkumar (violin), Arun Prakash (mridangam) and Guruprasad (ghatam), toed her line. They linked their professionalism to the poise of the programme.The inaugural concert was meant not merely to be heard and intellectually comprehended, but more valuably to touch the recesses of the heart. The Tamil channel of Sri Venkateswara Bhakthi Channel will telecast the Rasanubhava concert every month.
