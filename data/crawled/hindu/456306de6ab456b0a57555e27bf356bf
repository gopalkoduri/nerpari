VVijish Kumar V. provided the rasikas a melodic treat at a concert at Vithunni Saneeswara temple, Palakkad.His stringent training and tutelage under gurus such as Mankulam Ganesan Namboothiri, Puduppararam Unnikrishnan and Trichi Ganesan has helped  him imbibe the intricacies and nuances of Carnatic music. Thus, his concert was marked with confidence and perfection.His full-throated pliable voice, which was pepped with brigas and in perfect harmony with sruthi,  captivated the listeners.Right from the very first item, &#8216;Sami ninnekori,&#8217; an Adi tala varnam in Sreeraga, composed by Gabhapuri Vasan, Vijish created a perfect musical ambience with the enlivening support of Kodunthirappully Subbaraman on the violin and Palakkad A. Ganesan on the mridangam.Two brisk numbers, a rare composition of Surajanandar, &#8216;Sidhi Budhi nadham Sreeganesam&#8217; in Kannada and a Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Raghu nayaka nee padayutha&#8217; in Hamsadhwani,  were enriched with impressive swarakalpana and  brisk and lilting swara patterns, reminding the audience of his guru Trichi Ganesan.A brief but neat sketch of  Valachi evoked the ragabhava  for Harikesanallur Muthayya Bhagavathar&#8217;s &#8216;Jalandhara supeetha,&#8217; &#8216;Vilayata ithu nerama,&#8217; composed by T.R. Balu in Shanmukhapriya  on Lord Muruka and &#8216;Sreeramachandra krupalu&#8217; in Yamunakalyani, composed by Thulasidas,  which were soaked in devotional fervour, struck a chord with the audience.Ragalapana of the 63rd Melakartha, Lathangi, was pure and classical, with flashes of sancharas that illuminated various facets of the raga. &#8216;Mariveredikkevvaro&#8217; of Pattanam Subramania Iyer, set to Khandha chappu tala, was embellished with artistic niraval and cascading manodharma swaras at &#8216;Manasara ninusara moralimsu keerthana.&#8217;The detailed elaboration of Poorvikalyani, with attractive phrases, revolving  the lower octave and easily traversing through the three octaves up to tharasthayi panchamam enriched the charm of the raga, enthralling the music buffs. Subbaraman complemented it on the violin in his solo.The articulation of the composition &#8216;Meenakshi me mudam&#8217; of Dikshitar, set to Adi tala, (2 kala), was sung in a slow beat that adhered to the elegance of the composition. It was adorned with artistic niraval at &#8216;madhurapuri nilaye, mathivadane,&#8217; followed by brilliant swara kalpana in two speeds.The composition was decorated with ragamalika swara pattern in second speed, comprising  ragas Kunthala varali, Darbar and Hamsanadam. The evolution from Kalyani to Mohanam, Madhyamavathi and Hindolam by &#8216;sruthibhedam&#8217; was unique.The Thani of A. Ganesan stood out with beautiful phrases.In the latter half of the concert, the popular song &#8216;Ennathavam cheithanai&#8217; of Papanasam Sivan was presented  from the anupallavi &#8216;Irezhu bhuvanangal&#8217; .Vijish Kumar concluded his concert with Sivaranjini tillana and the slokam &#8216;Krishnaya Vasudevaya&#8217; in Madhyamavathi. The concert was organised by Swathi Sangeetha Sabha, Palakkad.
