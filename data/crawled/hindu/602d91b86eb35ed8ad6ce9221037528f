VTrichy Sivakumar's veena recital was held in connection with the K.S. Narayanaswamy Memorial Concert in Kochi. Sivakumar started the concert with the varnam &#8216;Karunimpa' in Sahana. He played brisk passages with absolute ease and dexterity given the fact that the veena is a relatively tough instrument to handle and playing swift gamakas with clarity can be quite a daunting feat.He then moved on to raga Atana, playing &#8216;Sreemahaganapathim bhajeham,' a kriti of Mysore Vasudevachar, with aplomb. The vainika relied on the Ati madhyama kala, which is played a trifle faster than the medium tempo.Brisk renditionSyama Sastri's Bhairavi Swarajathi &#8216;Kamakshi amba' remains a favourite of most musicians. The artiste performed this composition impeccably.The tonal quality of the veena in the lower octave was further explored in the raga delineation of Saveri. Sivakumar played deftly, interspersing multiple octaves.His disciple who played the violin, could not rise to the occasion at many points; her playing lacking in clarity and presence.The Syama Sastri kriti &#8216;Sankari Sankuru' was played projecting its unique aspect of highlighting the &#8216;chaturasra' aspect in &#8216;tisra.' The niraval at &#8216;Shyama Krishna Sodari' reached wide realms of improvisation and was followed by quick and short swara essays in the raga.The rakthi raga Saveri evoked rasas of sringara and atbhutha. In contrast he played a plaintive strain of Arabhi raga followed by Swati Tirunal's &#8216;Pahi parvathanandini.'While exploring raga Kalyani, the vainika played a few unique flourishes, eschewing the routine approach to the raga. There was a true adventurous streak in his raga elaboration. Veena, the instrument considered closest to the human voice, can take music to sublime levels in its &#8216;gayaki' mode of playing. This was revealed in the rendering of &#8216;Nidhichala sukhama' a composition of Tyagaraja in misra chappu tala.G. Babu supported the artiste well on the mridangam. He displayed perfect coordination in the taniavarthanam with Adhichanallur Anil Kumar on the ghatam. Their controlled performance made sure that the sublime quality of the veena was not lost in exciting laya exercises.A pulse on the crowdKeeping with the demands of a predominantly Telugu audience, the artiste played the popular Telugu composition &#8216;Brahma okate' in Bowli raga, by Annamacharya and &#8216;Bhagayada lakshmi baramma' in Madhyamavati.The Tamil ragamalika &#8216;Theeradu vilayattu pillai' by Subramania Bharati and &#8216;Bho Sambho' in Revathi raga too struck a chord with the audience. The programme was organised by Andhra Cultural Association, Veena Sangeetha Sangh and Rasikapriya.
