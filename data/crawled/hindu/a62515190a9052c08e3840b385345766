VOnce upon a time there weren't many lovers of Western classical music in Chennai. But times have changed; and today there are hundreds, who are earnestly interested in the music of legendary European composers, such as Beethoven, Bach, Brahms, Haydn, Mozart, Tchaikovsky and others.So Chennai has an audience for well-accomplished foreign musicians, who come over here to present programmes. The Austrian Consulate in Chennai deserves to be lauded for consistently organising Western chamber music recitals, by visiting musicians based in Vienna. A recent performance at the Srimathi Sivagami Petachi auditorium by violinist Eva Steinschaden and pianist Alexander Vavtar -- who are the backbone of a distinguished music ensemble called Nota Bene in Vienna, which sometimes includes other musicians also -- was a source of immense satisfaction for a large gathering, which included many students of Western music.Mozart's sonatasTwo sonatas for violin and piano by Mozart (A Major, KV 305) and Schubert (A Minor), with which the concert began and ended, were truly heart-warming. Between them came a short string of three cameos by Fritz Kreisler, which were very melodious and pleasing -- and a puzzling contemporary work, titled Dream Fragments, by Ludwig Nusbichler (2003). The latter was replete with plucking and screeching noises, and introduced a rather jarring note, so far as the audience in this part of the world was concerned. Instead of this bizarre number, another work of Mozart or Beethoven would have been most welcome!As an encore, the duo played a prayer-like piece by Estonian composer Arvo Part, titled, &#8216;Mirror in the Mirror,' which had a serene and meditative quality like that of the classic hymn, &#8216;Abide By Me,' made so famous in India by our military bands, in the context of the Republic Day celebrations. And that did touch our hearts, too!
