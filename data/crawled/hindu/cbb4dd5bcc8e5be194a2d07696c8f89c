VK. C. ASOKTodi is a weighty raga. Changing itsmadhyamamtopratimadhyamammakes it the multifaceted raga known as Bhavapriya. It also bears a close resemblance to Subhapanthuvarali raga, for the difference lies only in thenishadha.Thrissur V.R. Dileep Kumar, whose concert was held on the fourth day of the recently concluded 30th Neelakanta Sivan Sangeetha Aradhana, chose `Mamava Siddha Nirjara... ' in Bhavapriya as one of the main pieces in his recital. When he started detailing the raga, somerasikaswere seen trying to  find out which raga it was.Familiar kritisHis recital included familiar kritis like `Mokshamugala..'(Saramathi), `Ananda nadamaduvathille... ' (Poorvikalyani), and `Eppavaruvayo... ' (Jogpuri), and also less familiar kritis like `Pahi suresha... ' (Nata), and `Maridalaretuma swami... ' (Khamas).After a fast number in Attana (`Sakala Kala ... ' in Kanda Chappu tala) came `Keeravani,' a popular raga.Ragam-thanam-pallavi (`Kailasa pathe pasupathe gouri pathe trilokapathe... ') was the major item of the concert. However, the elaboration of Keeravani seemed to lack its conventional sense of calm.Throughout the concert, S. Eswara Varma's accompaniment on the violin was superb. Vaikom P.S. Venugopal on the mridangam and Adhichanalloor Anil Kumar on the ghatom did a good job. The vocalist could have reduced the number of racysangathis.Ragas like Nalinakanti, Vasanti and Vijayasree were used in thekalpana swarasto conclude the main item.Mukhathala Sivaji's concert was marked by his cultured voice and free flow of `sangathis.'Natta, with which he began the concert, was followed by `Jaya jaya swamin' in Adhi tala. Hen then sang `Sankari neeve amba... ' composed in Begada and set to Roopaka tala, and `Palimpara in Arabhi.Mix of old and newThe song that featured in most of the concerts during the festival was `Ananda nadamaduvathille... ' in Poorvikalyani as it is one of the most popular compositions of Neelakanta Sivan. `Manavinala kim... ' in Nalinakanti was followed by `Karunakara siva sankara' in Gourimanohari, which differs from Keeravani in `daivadam.' A not-so-often-heard `Vararagalaya... ' in Chenchu Kamboji was the `thukkada,' after which came the main item in Madhyamavathi, `Palimsu Kamakshi Pavani...
