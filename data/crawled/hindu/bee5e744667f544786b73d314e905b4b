VLALITHAA KRISHNANThe Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha, in association with Mudhra, has organised a series of three musical features on consecutive Sundays as part of their 27th Isai, Iyal, Nataka Vizha. The first of these, held on December 10, was titled ``Ariyakkudi to Semmangudi."In his introductory address, Cleveland V.V.Sundaram touched upon the relevance of the presentation as it would urge rasikas to reflect upon the music of yesteryear vidwans and study their approach in the context of the changes that have taken place over the years leading to the present day performing scenario.Compiled with great careThe power point presentation conceptualised and compiled with great care and attention by Radha Bhaskar and Mudhra Bhaskar included photographs and wonderfully lucid explanations about the unique features and philosophy underlying thebhaniof stalwarts such as Ariyakkudi Ramanuja Iyengar, Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer, Madurai Mani Iyer, the Alathur Brothers, Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar, G.N.Balasubramaniam, Musiri Subramania Iyer, Maharajapuram Santhanam, M.L.Vasanthakumari, T. Brinda, M.S. Subbulakshmi and M.D.Ramanathan, prefaced by a brief biography of each artiste.Radha Bhaskar pointed out that the list was neither exhaustive nor chronological and that several more artistes would have been featured but for the paucity of time. The special aspects of each performing style were illustrated by audio clippings and wherever available, video clippings as well. The video clipping featuring M.L.Vasanthakumari's rendition of Jayadeva's Ashtapadi ``Haririha" was particularly evocative, the vidushi's blend of melody and emotive elements giving an insight into the musical expression of one of the most imaginative and cerebral stars to grace the firmament of classical music. There was also a rare clipping of Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna on the violin accompanying Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer in concert, which made for interesting viewing.Guru-sishya relationshipAfter each musical interlude, there was a short panel discussion with eminent musicologist, S.A.K.Durga dwelling on the special aspects of each performing style, her explanations enlivened by anecdotes relating to her direct interaction with several of the stalwarts featured, by virtue of long time family association and the guru-sishya relationship. The panellists also stressed that the feature was in the nature of homage to the invaluable contributions of the all-time greats.At the conclusion, the disciples who represent the guru-sishya parampara and constitute a personal link with these great musicians were honoured, aptly carrying forward the spirit of the presentation.The programme was an uplifting and singularly instructive experience for connoisseurs and lay listeners alike. For the space of a few hours, all those present were transported to the golden age of Carnatic music when artistic integrity reigned supreme and artistes chose to lead by example.Bottom Template Starts
