VThe emotions displayed by the composers in their compositions have to be understood to be able to give the effect of a vocal rendition. Lalgudi Jayaraman is an artist who has followed this path religiously during his long career in the field of Carnatic music.The concert under review is akin to a vocal concert as the violinist is able to bring out the beauty of the lyrics in all the compositions. The contrast in bowing and fingering techniques adopted for the swara and sahitya passages, in the Gowla composition &#8216;Dudukugala &#8217; stands testimony to this fact.The concert begins  with Lalgudi&#8217;s own varnam in Bahudari. The raga swaroopa of Bahudari is established without any ambiguity in the opening phrase.Lalgudi&#8217;s compositions always reveal the identity of the melody in their opening phrases which makes the listeners comfortable. The madyama kala rendition of the varnam sets the pace for the delicious fare which follows.Gopalakrishna Bharathi&#8217;s evergreen creation &#8216;Sabhapathikku&#8217; preceded by a compact vinyasa of Abogi and followed with precise kalpanaswaras including a few poruthams are an aural feast.Among the many compositions in Mohanam that the violinist has played, the Misra chapu creation of Tyagaraja &#8216;Mati Matiki,&#8217; seems to be his favourite. Tyagaraja in this song questions Lord Rama as to how many times does he have to convey the anguish in his heart for the Lord to come to his protection. This mood is perfectly reflected in the artiste&#8217;s rendition.The confidence displayed by the vidwan during his swara exercises is a result of sheer dedication to the art. Guru Karaikudi Mani&#8217;s accompaniment on the mridangam for this piece and for the varnam earlier is exemplary and his knowledge of Lalgudi&#8217;s creations are obvious from the manner in which he literally plays the varnam on the mridangam.Teaming up with the mridangam vidwan is C.K.Shyamsundar on the ganjira, whose  enthusiastic playing lends colour to the proceedings.Certain ragas in the Carnatic system need to be briefly presented during alapanas, as overdoing the vinyasa  may fatigue the listeners.The professional, that Lalgudi is, makes his essay of Natakapriya to the point.N.C.Krishnamacharyalu&#8217;s composition &#8216;Marajananim&#8217; with an interesting chittaswara is gripping. Out of the few available compositions in Natakapriya, this song stands out. The majestic portion of this concert is the Bhairavi suite which comprises Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s magnum opus &#8216;Balagopala,&#8217; preceding which is an exquisite display of Bhairavi on a huge canvas. All through the lengthy alapana the artiste has played phrasings and prayogas which are totally capable of being rendered vocally.There has been no room given to instrumental liberties which has made the alapana wholesome and gives great satisfaction to the listeners whose ears are attuned only to sampradaya classical music.&#8216;Balagopala&#8217; is a summary of the Bhagavatham and the manner in which the bowing of the artiste is vigorous while playing for the sahitya portion &#8216;Drona Karna Duryodhanadi Hara&#8217; and mild and gentle for the lyrics &#8216;Draupadi Mana Samrakshana&#8217; speak of his genius and his sincerity in approaching a composition.The raga bhava studded swaras are played for &#8216;Neela Neeratha Shareera&#8217; and the kuraippu alternating between the Panchama and madhyama is a thing of sheer beauty. Guru Karaikudi Mani&#8217;s tani avarthanam with C.K.Shamsundar&#8217;s ganjira upa pakkavadyam is a class apart.  Mani&#8217;s close following of the various compositions reveal the vocalist within him.&#8216;Niravadhisukhada&#8217; ( Ravichandrika) of Tyagaraja is preferred by many an artiste as a prelude to the Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi.Lalgudi plays this piece with gay abandon in an accelerated tempo setting the ground for the Dharmavathi alapana, tanam and pallavi in Chatusra Jathi Ata talam. Here, again Lalgudi displays his excellence in the raga rendition and thanam. The pallavi is a treat for laya aficionados.A Thillana of the violinist in Dwijavanti and &#8216;Teerada Vilaiyattu Pillai&#8217; of Subramanya Bharathi in Ragamalika provide the dessert fare.PVK
