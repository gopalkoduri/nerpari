VKaivalyakumar is a recent\u000adiscovery in the world of\u000aCarnatic music and had\u000aappeared in some concerts\u000aalready revealing a great\u000afuture. He learnt the art in\u000aParupalli Sangeetha Vidyalaya\u000aat Vijayawada and then\u000ahad advanced learning under\u000athe tutelage of Pattammal's\u000adisciple Lalitha of Chennai.\u000aHe is blessed with good vocal\u000aculture with range. He is a\u000agraded artiste of AIR and\u000ahas also earned Central Government's\u000ascholarship. He\u000adisplayed rich imagination\u000aand also compiled a large\u000arepertoire. He is known for\u000athe rendition of Annamacharya\u000acompositions and\u000awon awards for it. Perhaps\u000abecause of this influence, he\u000apacked his repertoire this\u000atime with half a dozen\u000aAnnamacharya kirtanas in\u000athe concert he gave for\u000aSujanaranjani, last week\u000aheld at Hanuman Devasthanam\u000aauditorium in the\u000acity.He also revealed other\u000apositive qualities of his ability\u000ato present free flowing\u000aswaraprasthara and rendition\u000aof the kriti with perfect\u000amodulation of sahitya.Accompanied by Pawan\u000aSingh on violin and G.\u000aRamachandran on mridangam,\u000aKumar opened with\u000aVatapi in Hamsadhwani and\u000athen rendered Melukovayya\u000ain Bowli of Thyagaraja with\u000agood expression. Koluvaiyunnade\u000ain Devagandhari,\u000aMarugelara in Jayanthisri\u000aand Telisirama Chintanato\u000ain Poornachandrika were\u000awell received renditions before\u000ahe chose Abheri as his\u000amain raga of the concert.\u000aBut the composition he rendered\u000awas Paluku Tenela\u000aTalli of Annamacharya, set\u000ato music by Nedunuri. Amrutha\u000aVarshini was the most\u000aattractive essay of the concert.\u000aHis choice number in\u000athis was Anandamruthaakarshini.The swara phrases in the\u000aprasthara part spoke of his\u000aimagination. Namo Namo\u000aNarayana of Annamacharya\u000ain Bowli and Telisirama\u000aChintana in Udayaravichandrika\u000aare worth mentioning.\u000aRamachandran gave a delightful\u000aTani avartanam on\u000amridangam.
