VShanti Sharma had a Master&#8217;s in Chemistry from BITS Pilani.She was my guru-behen and friend, Shanti (Vaidyanathan) Sharma, and it is next to impossible to be dispassionate. But no! The moment demands a tribute to this classical vocalist who decided to bid adieu to the &#8216;classy&#8217; world  at the peak of her career &#8212; almost like her dada-guru Ustad Amir Khan.Her debut recital at Kamani auditorium, a venerated platform even for a student of Shri Ram Bharatiya Kala Kendra (SBKK) training with Pandit Amarnath, came under the scanner and emerged  in flying colours in early 1980. There were those who were pleasantly surprised that the name Vaidyanathan did not leave any trail of the Carnatic style during the meditative badhat or melodic elaboration. There were others who were amazed by the powerful solfas and taans  produced by the apparently soft, almost inaudible, silky voice of the reed-thin dimpled beauty in her early 20s. Even a visibly happy Guruji (Pandit Amarnath), with a mischievous smile, commented in the  next class, &#8220;Arre Maharaj, Kishori (Amonkar)ji ka asar zabardast hai&#8212; tremendous impact!&#8221;With her characteristic poise Shanti kept mum but later,  gently confided that though she was initiated into Carnatic music by her mother, it was Ustad Amir Khan&#8217;s music that swept her off her feet. Even a Master&#8217;s in Chemistry from BITS Pilani could not detract her. Yes, Kishori  Amonkar mesmerised her. Any good music did.Yet she followed the path guided by Guruji with total dedication and, though equally adept at lighter genres, stayed away from the lucrative offers from reputed composers. But destiny took her under the direction of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan and she recorded several songs for his &#8220;Shaan-e Mughal&#8221;, a grand production by SBKK.All this inspired the innovative composer in her and she became an integral part of SBKK productions apart from holding the post of a guru there. By this time she had covered the length and breadth of the country and several places abroad giving recitals and winning accolades. The rave reviews speak for themselves.After the sad demise of Guruji, her quest for music brought her to Ustad Mashkoor Ali Khan. Critics did not spare her action but she stood her ground with logic: After all, Ustad Amir Khan&#8217;s music drew its sap from this gharana!With maturity, her introspective self stopped looking for sparkling virtuosity and delved deep in the ragas she sang. Her intellectualism left its stamp on everything: her music, her dress sense, her carriage, her flawless, courteous language.... A prolific writer, she wrote papers on request for people who never acknowledged her contribution.A fun-loving soul she giggled when her heart bled and sang soulfully when she longed to shed tears. A thinking performer, she always practiced honesty and turned away from everything, sometimes at the last moment, that lured at the cost of a compromise.By today&#8217;s standards she was a total misfit. It is  difficult not to spout venom against all that tortured and drove a beautiful soul to death,  to resist from exposing the muck, carefully covered under the carpet called &#8216;culture&#8217; &#8212; especially after sharing almost three decades of agony and pain with the victim.In her life, wrought with struggle against all odds &#8212; including the loss of one of her two children &#8212;  Shanti proved that with  single-minded devotion towards one&#8217;s art it is possible to carve out a niche even without the crutches ofgharanedarlineage. And her painful death proved that a self-respecting, super-sensitive, gullible, loving soul like hers eternally craved  the due respect for her first love &#8212; music. She desired to immerse one and all in the soothing strains of her music. It seems now that she had asked for too much from this cultured world.
