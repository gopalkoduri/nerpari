VFOR SOME years now the Sangeeta Sudhakar Balakrushna Dash Foundation has been rendering yeoman's service to the cause of Odissi music by arranging a three-day festival in Bhubaneswar.Odissi music has a hoary antiquity and variety. Of late there have been attempts to establish it as the third stream of classical music since it has a system and range of `ragas' completely different from the Hindustani and Carnatic styles.The foundation named after the legendary musician Balakrushna Dash, provides a platform for various artistes and institutions engaged in the pursuit of Odissi music and an all embracing umbrella that features everything from traditional music to `Gotipua' music to `Udra Padhatiya' music.On the opening evening, after a group performance of "Saraswati Vandana," Pandit Raghunath Panigrahi rendered "Geeta Govinda." Gotipua guru Lingaraj Barik's excellent demonstration of Gotipua music followed. Pandit Dr. Damodar Hota who came up next held the audience spellbound with his Udra Padhatiya Sangeet recital.After the performance of Arati Mishra, it was the turn of traditional artistes from different parts of the State. The morning sessions on the last two days were devoted to Odissi music institutions from far and wide while the evening sessions featured established singers including Guru Gopal Chandra Panda, Lata Ghosh, Shyamamani Devi, Minatii Bhanja, Chandramani Lenka and Bijay Jena.While the foundation deserves kudos for such an event every year, the programmes need to be monitored properly with an eye on timing. Meetings eat into the time and sometimes group recitals delayed the solos. One found the audience leaving as things got late. With a little more planning and control the event would be compact and make a better impact.B.MBottom Template Starts
