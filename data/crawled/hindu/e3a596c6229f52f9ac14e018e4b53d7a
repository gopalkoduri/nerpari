VSanjay Subrahmaniam, it was obvious, had done a great deal of &#8220;data mining&#8221; to bring out Mayuram Viswanatha Sastri's &#8220;hidden gems.&#8221; Jaya TV's Margazhi Mahotsavam this year saw him make a beginning for this season with this theme &#8211; Sastri's songs. As is his wont, he discreetly avoided the oft-heard &#8216;Jayathi Jayathi Bharatha Matha' and &#8216;Sonnadhai Seidhida Saagasama'.This was not disappointing as there was a rich fund of songs - all &#8220;paperless renditions&#8221; - that brought out the breadth of vision this composer had and also displayed how well Sastri had mastered the many forms of compositions that were in existence during his period. The beginning Gowlai varnam (&#8216;Gananadha Nin Ponnadi') was followed by &#8216;Kadavul Vazhthu' from Thirukkural and what was on offer was value, as this composer has won a special place in history by becoming arguably the first tunesmith to put Thirukkural in ragas. Sanjay interestingly began with the second line &#8216;Bhagavan Muthatre Ulagu' in Hamsadhwani, which did not disturb the prosody. There were two notable alapanas for Khamas (&#8216;Jaalame Seivadhu Azhagaguma') and Amrithavarshini (&#8216;Mayilvahana').Astute laya exerciseThe Khamas song had a laya structure that alternated between chathusram and thisram - sung faithfully, and could be considered as a laya exercise astutely built into the kriti.The Thodi delineation that came next in order fitted the Swarajathi (&#8216;Sarasadhalanayana') that was taken up. Sanjay put his heart and soul into it making the Swarakshara format at its ideal pace. Tirukkural resurfaced in the form of verses from Ozhukkamudaimai (comprehensive discipline) in Kalyana Vasantham. The other songs were &#8216;Vaa Vaa Velmuruga' (Sindubhairavi) and &#8216;Bharatha Samrajaya Sukhi' in Desh.Varadarajan on the violin accompanied applying his mind unwaveringly when following these rare songs which was reflective of his fine artistic vitality. His alapanas helped sustain the tempo of the concert. Neyveli Venkatesh on the mridangam provided rhythmic support that had a self-contained balance and his thani had as its highlight a long and continuous combination of idadhu prayogas inserted at the right places in his korvais that were presented in various kalams.Some facts about the composer...M ayuram Viswanatha Sastri (1893-1958) has written songs in praise of Lord Muruga in ragas ranging from Kunthalavarali to Thodi and Bhairavi, a Swarajathi in Thodi adopting the swarakshara style, varnams, padams, thillanas and written even plays and novels. The distinguishing mudras he used were Vedapuri and Viswanatha. His open-mindedness is typified by his choice of Hindustani ragas Behag, Yaman, Desh and Sindhubhairavi for a few of his compositions.The Freedom Movement perhaps inspired Sastri to bring out compositions not only on Gandhiji but also on his pet themes of khadar, and that of viewing India itself as a deity - as mother-incarnate. It would be of great relevance here to mention that he (Sastri) was drawn to the world of music by his mother. He was born in Therezhundur, birthplace of Kamban. His composition in Khamas - Jayathi Jayathi Bharatha Matha - won the distinction of being sung by Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer on India's first Independence Day and was broadcast by AIR.Sastri had many publications to his credit - Valli Parinaya Manipravala Satakam, Murugan Pugazhmalai, Murugan Madura Keertanai, and Tirukkural Madhura Keertanai. The last is perhaps unique for it was a pioneering venture that set to tune Tiruvalluvar's Tirukkural.Sastri's gurus in music were Namakkal Narasimha Iyengar, Devakottai Venkatrama Iyengar and Sundaram Iyer. He had taken valuable suggestions from Alathur Venkatesa Iyer and Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar regarding his musical career. His marital bliss was short-lived and he was not blessed with children either. Sastri was honoured with the title &#8216;Kantham,' in 1933 by Swami Balananda Saraswathi. Sastri could play the harmonium also. G.N. Balasubramaniam and Madurai Mani Iyer popularised many of his songs. Mayuram Viswanatha Sastri passed away in 1958.Vidwan Bangalore Shankar said: &#8220;Sastri's sister was Vallabham Kalyanasundaram from whom I had learnt music. His brother, Mayuram Vaidhyanadha Sastri, was also a musician of repute, and lived up to 100 years. Viswanatha Sastri's Tirukkural tunes (with notation) were published in the form of a book by the Government of Tamil Nadu. He was not only a dramatist but also an actor. Sastri has also made a special composition in a raga, named Sarasanana, which can be understood as Sarasangi without the panchamam. He had an excellent command over many languages including Tamil, Sanskrit and English.&#8221;
