VMaestro T.N. Krishnan's (T.N.K.) violin concerts are an aesthetic combination of tradition and creativity. The senior performer, composer, teacher and promoter of Indian classical music played to a discerning audience in Thripunithura, which enjoyed every nuance of the recital.The clarity of his melody, its fidelity and his bowing techniques were well appreciated by the rasikas. T.N.K. proved that one did not need gimmicks or modern technology (even microphones) to mesmerise listeners. It was pristine classical music at its best.His two-hour solo performance at Kalikkotta Palace was proof of his virtuosity and experience.Starting with &#8216;Ninnukori,' a varnam in Mohanan, composed by Ramanathapuram Srinivasa Iyyenkar, the consummate violinist moved on to the kriti &#8216;Natha thanumanisam,' a Tyagaraja composition in Chittaranjini raga. It was &#8216;nadopasana' of the highest level. The Swati composition &#8216;Mamava sada Janani' in Kanada, which followed, was enriched by the magical touch of his fingers.The niraval and kalpana swaras in Roopaka tala were outstanding. Here, the accompaniment by K.M.S. Mani and Tripunithura Radhakrishnan on the mridangam and the ghatam, respectively, provided admirable support to the alapana and the percussionists won generous applause.Next T.N.K. sang &#8216;Biranna Brova,' composed by Syama Sastri in Kalyani. Then came an elaborate &#8216;Oraju puju' in Kanadagoula, another Tyagaraja composition, set to Adi tala. It was followed by a fine ragam taanam pallavi. He went through the ragas such as Sankarabharanam, Kapi, Gourimanohari and Behag.Nuanced explorationsThe veteran musician explored the infinite nuances of the medium to convey its inherent spiritual element. The percussionists travelled along with him and their apt responses and team work made it a concert to remember.The taniavartanam excelled with a wide range of rhythmic patterns. &#8216;Saravana Bhava,' a kriti by Papanasam Sivan in Shanmukhapriya, Adi tala, was well received by the audience. Then he rendered two Swati kritis &#8211; &#8216;Tharuni Njan Enthu Cheyvu,' in raga Dwijayanthi and &#8216;Alarsara paritapam' in Surutty. The two pieces were remarkable for their laya and the instrumentalist's soft touches, brilliant bowing and unique flair enriched the compositions. With a Sindhubhairavi kriti, &#8216;Chandrasekhara Esa' and a mangalam in Madhyamavati, he concluded the concert, leaving the rasikas yearning for more.The concert was organised by the Sree Poonatrayeesa Sangeeta Sabha.
