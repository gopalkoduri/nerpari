VThe Association of British Scholars, a socio-academic and cultural body, celebrated its first anniversary on a grand scale last Sunday. Held in the Vedika of Hotel Daspalla in Visakhapatnam, the session was chaired by the president of the local chapter, AU Professor D. Pandu Ranga Rao. Eminent surgeon Dr. Goli Bhaskara Rao was also felicitated on the occasion.An enthralling recital ofghazalsby Visakhapatnam Akashvani music composer and Sangeetharatna awardee K.S. Chandrasekhar followed. Gifted with a melodious voice and playing the harmonium himself, Chandrasekhar sang his way into the hearts of the elite gathering. The emphatic rendering of each piece, especially theghazalsof Cinare (all set to lilting music by Chandraekhar himself), had a positive impact on the audience. His setting of the tunes and rendition were ample testimony of his mastery, imbibed under the expert tutelage of stalwarts like the late Ghantasala and music directors like Ramesh Naidu. The performance also reflected his own experience in composing music for 30-odd feature films.Interspersed in between the rendition weregeetslikeLaalipaata Nidurapovetalli(lyrics by Ramakoti), MeerabhajanKenusang Khelu Holi, old film songsO SajanaandAllah Tero Naam. These were rendered melodiously by Chandrasekhar's disciple D.V.L. Padmapriya. The performance was supported by Naresh on the guitar, Jayaraj on tabla and Siva on dholak.A.R.S.Bottom Template Starts
