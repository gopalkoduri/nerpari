VFor the ones in Hyderabad who were not glued to their television sets watching the historic India-Australia cricket world cup quarterfinal tie and had the chance to venture out in the city in search of some live music; a delectable fair of Maloya, a compound, rhythm-based musical form from Reunion Island, a tiny French colony on the Indian Ocean close to Mauritius, awaited them at the open air amphitheatre at Marrakesh, the lounge at Durgam Cheruvu, in Jubilee Hills.Unique folk musicThe concert, hosted by Alliance Francaise of Hyderabad, and performed by Danyel Waro and his ensemble, presented the unique folk music form which has sprung from the eclectic experience of the people of Reunion Island; a music into which the population of the island, with its rich mix of European, Indian, African, Malagasy and Chinese descent, have long been weaving their joys and their woes and making them into little songs to be hummed by plantation workers to relieve them of the tedium of trite existence.Waro, who composes exclusively in Creole, a native language which draws from French, has been championing the cause of Maloya and has also been given the epithet Creole King of Maloya.He has contributed immensely in popularising this form of music, the song of the &#8216;slaves', which was unofficially banned in the island and wiped out of public memory before being revived by the Communist Party of Reunion in the 1990s.Sonorous vocalsWaro's brand of Maloya, marked by his high-pitched, sonorous vocals, and a lively backbeat held by an array of traditional percussion instruments like the kayanm, a flat instrument made from cane flower stems and filled with saffron seeds, the bob, a musical bow attached to a calabash for resonance and the rouler, a drum made by stretching hides on barrels, struck an instant chord with the assembled with the music lovers naturally swaying their bodies to the bluesy grooves of the music.The earthy overtones of the sound, the almost spiritual, chant-like quality of the Creole songs and, above all, the simplicity of rendition, which is the essence of all folk music forms, perfectly blended, and even seemed to enhance the bacchanalian tone of the setting, with burning fragrant torches, elaborate wining and dining options and seating arrangements befitting of a medieval nautch, on the banks of a &#8216;secret lake'.The songs, which provide a glimpse into the lives of the people of Reunion Island, originate from the mixing of wide range of musical influences from Indian to African to even European and Chinese.For one who has grown up in the hills in Darjeeling, the tunes sound uncannily similar to those sung by the tea-picking tribal women on the idyllic slopes; for a world music aficionado, the beat is &#8216;classic' voodoo. But the beauty of music is that it is Maloya, a genre unique in itself.With an animated Waro egging the crowd to join in his songs, humming a &#8216;na..naa..naa..na' not being an arduous task in itself and still easier to immerse oneself into it, the people joined the musicians in the &#8216;act' and what was churned was an evening of mellifluous camaraderie.
