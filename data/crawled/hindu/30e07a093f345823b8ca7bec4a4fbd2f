VIt was as heady as a cocktail. Melange 2010 set against the backdrop of a lit-up Chowmahalla Palace with a silvery full moon as the canopy, was a blend of contemporary western instrumental with classical Indian sitar and tabla. The cheering elite gathering was the fizz that kept the artists grooving.Nishat Khan sounded the opening notes on the sitar in raag Maandu with guitarist Larry Coryell in tow. Lili Haydn bowed on the violin strings with lightning strokes bringing the notes to a crescendo as Trilok Gurtu, the ace percussionist kept the beat, showing off his multi-talented dexterity with aplomb.Later, Haydn gave us a solo with her soprano rising to a piercing pitch to match the finest note on her violin. It was exciting to an Indian audience not too literate with western music trends. So was Larry Coryell's presentation that was dedicated to his wife with enthusiasm. The intermittent chords struck sweet notes that were topped with a series of speedy, high-pitched octaves. Cool drift wasn't as cool as all that nor did the music drift in mellowy tones. It was a cool blast with the ensemble strumming and stringing and banging of course in full form.Gurtu pounded on the drums and other percussion with &#233;lan. The agility with which his fingers created a flow of rhythm was awesome. Not a second's pause was visible in his beat which went on and on as if there was no tomorrow.Frank Martin on the keyboards and Itai Disraeli on the bass were in absolute synch and spirit. A wonderful song came as a respite from six into one instrumental fusion .The ambience of the ancient Chowmahalla was charged with electronic vigour or so it seemed. Truly Melange testified that music has no boundaries. Seagrams 100 pipers sponsored the show.
