VSmaranajali &#8211; Kathakali PadangalBy Kalamandalam Unnikrishna Kurup Dinacharana Committee, IrinjalakudaPrice: Rs.100.Vocal music of Kathakali reached its  zenith  in the 1970&#8217;s. The duo that made it possible was Kalamandalam Unnikrishna Kurup and Kalamandalam Sankaran Embranthiri. &#8216;Smaranajali,&#8217; a CD in two parts, is a befitting tribute to the great masters.The first part of the CD encompasses  enchanting slokams and padams associated with the Hamsam and Damayanthi in the play &#8216;Nalacharitam Onaam Divasam.&#8217; The deep voice of Kurup merges well with the silky resonance of Embranthiri in the very first padam &#8216;Thottene njan kaikalkondu.&#8217;Damayanathi&#8217;s curiosity about the golden swan that has flown down from the sky is amply revealed in the treatment of the raga Yadukulakamboji. Kurup&#8217;s instinct to play with the matras of the tala in relation to the letters and the words directly appeals to  listeners.Hamsam&#8217;s reply to Damayanthi, &#8216;Anganamarmaule Baale&#8217; in raga Kalyani, is a superb rendition. The sharing of the words in the charanams such as &#8216;Parihasikkum chilarpazhikkum&#8217; and &#8216;Vazhipizhackkum thavaninakkumbol&#8217; by the two vocalists is simply marvellous. The line &#8216;Nalinamizhimaarkkellam natapatippan&#8217; becomes a rhythmic excursion.The subsequent padam by Damayanthi, &#8216;Kanden nikate&#8217; in raga Khamas, brings out the grace of gamakas that both the vocalists employ in  competitive spirit. When it comes to the line &#8216;Thava vaachikam azhalmochakam&#8217; (your words take away the sadness)  Kurup&#8217;s spontaneity in rendition knows no bounds.The padam &#8216;Preethipoondarulakaye&#8217; in Sankarabharanam that closely follows is replete with plain notes in mid tempo. Damayanthi&#8217;s padam &#8216;Naalil naalil varum aadhi moolam&#8217; (anguish built up day by day) is in raga Natakkurinji, which Kurup found more appropriate than the conventional Anandabhairavi.  The padams in Shanmughapriya and Neelambari too are engrossing.The second part of the CD has four padams; two of which truly reflect the classicism of Kathakali music. Set to ragas Thodi and Kalyani, &#8216;Lokapaalanmare&#8217; and &#8216;Ghoravipinam&#8217; are in  slow-tempos and reveal the identity of functional music. With frills few and far between, the jeevaswaras of these two ghanaragaas find the fullest expression when Kurup sings  with the support of Embranthiri.The last two padams, &#8216;Sreemansakhe&#8217; and &#8216;Nadhabhavalcharana&#8217; are from the play &#8216;Santhanagopalam.&#8217;
