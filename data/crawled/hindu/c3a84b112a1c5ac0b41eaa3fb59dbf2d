VRecitals by noted vocal duo, Hyderabad brothers D. Raghavachari and Seshachari, and Aruna Sairam of Chennai, marked the second and third evenings of the six-day fete of music, dance and drama organised from last Saturday by Visakha Music and Dance Academy at Kalabharathi.Covering a range little over two octaves, the duo in the company of Dwaram Satyanarana Rao on violin, Vankayala Venkata Ramana Murty on mridangam and Nemani Somayajulu on ghatam, rendered  a skilful recital. But for the domination by the younger Seshachari who was unduly loud, gesticulating and drowning out the pleasant and poised exposition of Raghavachari, it could be  hailed as a sumptuous feast of classicism. If compatible and complementing, the brothers could stand established as an invincible vocal duo.Expansive expatiation ofPalavichaaramulelaof Annamayya (Shanmukhapriya) marked with elated aalapana by the elder brother andNinnenamminaanu(Todi) of Syama Sastry stood out. The piece de resistance, however, was the excellent support lent by Satyanarayana and Ramanamurty along with Somayajulu. The thani in particular by Murty was sublimely a scholarly exercise.Experiencing elated naadanubhoothi starting with the rendering of Suddha Dhanyasi varnam, Aruna kept the auditorium enthralled for over two hours. H.N. Bhaskar on violin, Vaidyanadhan on mridangam and S.V. Ramani on ghatam while following and playing their turns proved to be her peers. Her rendering ofNannuvidachiof Tyagaraja (Reethigowla) with brief but beautiful aalapana,Kanaka Saila Vihaariniof Syama Sastry (Punnagavarali) andChakkani Rajamargamulundagaof Tyagaraja (Kharaharapriya), with soulful involvement were the highlights.The rendering ofAnandamrithakarshini(Amrithavarshini), a composition of Veena Kuppayyar (Kambhoji) andPurandhara Dasaattracted applause.
