VIf the objective of &#8216;Yodhaka,&#8217; the 90-minute recital of Pradeep&#8217;s musical ensemble for Hamsadhwani   was to demonstrate the facility with which Western ethos can blend with Indian music, one cannot call it original; if it was to dis\u000aplay the skill that would be needed to make a tasteful mix of the core notes of different ragas in the Carnatic music genre, it is again an old story, inasmuch as we have often experienced this in film music; besides these &#8212; which were done in a commendably presentable way &#8212; what the listener witnessed was how aptly the words of the Sanskrit language with their ponderous gait, resembling that of the elephant, could be accentuated in music.The rumbling of Siva&#8217;s drum, the deep-throated strumming of John Antony&#8217;s guitar and Keith Peters&#8217;s bass fused with the rich and flexible voice of Pradeep chanting the Sanskrit verses from &#8216;Ganesa Pancharatnam&#8217; as the feature started.The gliding notes of the slide guitar played by Pradeep lent pleasant support, as they stressed the threesome metre of tisram when Subhiksha Rangarajan&#8217;s melodious and rich voice rang out with the tunes of the &#8216;Eka sloki,&#8217; which encapsulated the three big puranas of Hindu tradition, the &#8216;Ramayanam,&#8217; &#8216;Srimad Bhagavatam&#8217; and the &#8216;Mahabharatam&#8217; in a set of three verses. Audience applause came prematurely, before the third one started, with a silent pause, broken by a series of phrases in Darbuka Siva&#8217;s percussion, as an effective preamble to the Great Mahabharata War.Pradeep sang &#8216;Na Hi Jaane Samskrtam&#8217; ending with the burden &#8216;Dehi Tvam Darsanam, Venkatesa,&#8217; bringing out the utter humility of the devotee, who acknowledges total ignorance of the sastras, but goes only by bhakti to the Lord. The essential feature here was the rapid change in scale, in the western style. In a total departure in style, Vidya Lakshmi rendered an out-and-out Carnatic item &#8216;Sri Sampoorne&#8217; in Sri ragam, for which the slide guitar was an apt backdrop. Having all the flavour of a composition of a master, it was announced to have been a creation by Pranav for the sahityam, and set to music by Pradeep. The item on Siva&#8217;s dance, coming after this, was set in a mixture of various ragas, Mand, Behag and Saranga, and gave scope for the percussion to simulate &#8216;tandava.&#8217;The brief interlude of Naveen Iyer on the pianica (recorder) and then on the flute, with Siva on the drum, was a pure melody item.The pipes produced the effect of birds, in solitary and formation flights, chattering their ditties, while the drum conjured up the breeze growing into a wind, raising a riot of birds. While Siva producted a delightful work of modulation and superfast phrasings, Naveen created the effect of sunrise, with birds and cattle setting out. &#8216;Neelakantha vaahanam,&#8217; in a camouflaged mix of ragas Chenjurutti, Yamuna-Kalyani and Bageshri, brought out the peacock as Lord Subrahmanya&#8217;s vehicle.&#8216;Adharam Madhuram&#8217; (Madhurashtakam) showed up Kalyani, another young singer, coming up with a rich, highpitched, powerful voice. The programme concluded with &#8216;Krishnashtakam,&#8217; with a touch of Irish folk music in it, sung by Kalyani, with a pinch of raga Khamas in it; followed by &#8216;Om Shanti.&#8217;This tune alone was sung by the three female singers, the others being on their instruments. Pradeep sang the lines of the verses &#8216;Sruti Jaatam Rudra Roopam&#8217; concluding with &#8216;Satyam Sivam Sundaram Bhadram Sivam Mangalam.&#8217;The team must be complimented on the bold experiment.  The spontaneous enthusiasm of all the participants was there for all to see, which accounted for more than half the success of the evening&#8217;s work.While the short time given for preparation and rehearsal of the feature  did emerge in the occasional uncertainty and silent exchanges for cues among the artists on the stage, the overall result was pleasant.The team  no doubt needs to put in more hours of practice and also  improve the content, both in terms of lyrics and through more profound music.One notable point was the essentially clean articulation among the singers, although there were a couple of occasions when &#8216;dha&#8217; was uttered instead of &#8216;da.&#8217;
