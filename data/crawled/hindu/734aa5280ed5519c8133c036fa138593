VIt was a modest but attentive gathering that welcomed P.S. Ranganath's vocal recital of Annamacharya kritis for Lalitha Kala Vedika. A significant part of the artist's career has been interwoven with the TTD's Annamacharya Project, whose aim is to tune, record and propagate the compositions of Tallapakkam Annamacharya, the 15 {+t} {+h} century saint poet.Projecting the spirit of the compositions through a resonant voice and crystal clear enunciation, the artist suffused the lyric with the warm glow of heartfelt emotion. An interesting line-up of traditional as well as catchy ragas and mellifluous tunes marked the presentation.Filled with devotionThere was no mistaking the artist's deep involvement as he launched into fluent renditions of &#8216;Indira Vaddincha' in a breezy, energetic Kalyani bursting with positivity, &#8216;Veena Vaayinchane' in lilting Valaji and &#8216;Bangaru Medala Lona' in benign Madhyamavati.&#8216;Kadiri Nrisimhudu' in Atana stood out for packed madhyamakala sahitya and chittaswara marching in neat lines to a precise gait. &#8216;Ranga Ranga Rangapathi' (Sindhubhairavi) that hit the tara sthayi panchama with intensity, was a perfectly aimed shaft of devotion that flew unerringly to the feet of Lord Venkateswara. Familiar favourites such as &#8216;Brahma Kadigina Paadamu' (Mukhari) also heightened the devotional ambience. All through, lyric was king, the composition itself taking centre stage, highlighted by impeccable diction. A well balanced audio system enhanced aural impact.K. Shankar (violin) and Parupalli Balasubramaniam (mridangam) anticipated sangatis with the alacrity that comes from familiarity with the compositions.
