VMusicians, reputed and up-and-coming, showcased the best of their artistry while paying musical homage to  Tyagaraja during a three-day &#8216;Sree Tyagaraja Jayanti Music Festival 2009&#8217; held at Neeranjali Hall, Thrissur.  The fete began with a nagaswaram recital by Pollachi P.S. Muthuveeraswami accompanied by P.S. Sivakumar, Shanmughasundaram and S. Manikantan. Sama Veda chanting was done by Panjal Nellikkattu Mamunnu Vasudevan Nambuthiripad.   Unchavritty, Pancharatna Kirtana and Anjaneya Utsavam held on the last day added to the spiritual ambience of the festival.As for the recitals, Kadri Gopalnath opened with an inspiring recital of &#8216;Abheeshta Ganapathi&#8217; in Hamsadhwani, Adi tala.  As he switched to &#8216;Entharo mahanu bhavalu&#8217; in Sri raga, Adi tala, his mastery over the  saxophone was evident.  The alapana of Poorvikalyani was  creative and Kanyakumari very often went to the bass strings to add an extra dimension to the essaying of the raga. The composition was &#8216;Jnanamusarakada&#8217; in Rupaka tala.Interestingly, Kadri has a penchant for filling up the gaps himself, which serves as suggestions for his accompaniments to take over. Patri Satishkumar (mridangam), Thripunithura Radhakrishnan (ghatom) and Bangalore Rajasekharan (morsing) made such attempts  lively and enjoyable.The prime slots on the second day witnessed two major concerts by O.S. Thyagarajan and Ravikiran. OST began with the Jayanthasudha number in Adi tala, &#8216;Vinathasudhavahana.&#8217; &#8216;Jagadeeshapahimam&#8217; in Kalyani, Adi tala, was followed by the Varali piece in Adi tala, &#8216;Karuna elagande.&#8217; Before switching over to an exhaustive essaying of Kamboji &#8211; &#8216;Oh rangasaayi,&#8217; he passed through a short Begada namely, &#8216;Nee pada pankaja mulane neera nanminanu,&#8217; also in Adi tala. T.H. Subramaniam (violin) recreated the mood of Kamboji in an amazing manner that matched the vocalist&#8217;s creativity.Tani by Alappuzha Chandrasekharan Nair (mridangam), Kovai Suresh (ghatom) and Neyyattinkara Krishnan (morsing) was in the right proportion. OST wound up with the Utssavasambradaya kirtana in Neelambari, &#8216;Laliyugave mapali daivama&#8217; in Tripuda tala.Ravikiran  started with the Chithranjini composition in Adi, &#8216;Naada thanu manisam sankaram.&#8217; The alapana of Poorvikalyani was remarkable especially with the able support of violinist  M.A. Sundaresan.  After an enjoyable Yadukula Kamboji, &#8216;Hechcharikagaa rare Sree Ramachandra&#8217; in Khanda chapu, he chose Reetigoula as the main piece. The number was the popular &#8216;Dwaitamusukhama&#8217; in Adi tala.The musician took care to explain the rare raga Kanthaamani, the 61st Melakartha, in which compositions are also rare. He selected &#8216;Paaimchuvo, paalimchuravo&#8217; in Adi. A highly melodic piece, it was well received by the audience. The soothing Neelambari that followed was quite befitting the late hour of the night. Percussion support by H.S. Sudheendra (mridangam), Y.N. Santharam (ganjira), Gopinatha Prabhu (ghatom) and Bangalore Rajasekhar (morsing) was commendable.Notwithstanding  constraints posed by a heavy downpour outside and a wrong slot allotted to him (11 a.m.), Madurai T.N. Seshagopalan presented a scholarly concert which brought the curtain down on the music festival, on the third day. The virutham in Reetigoula was followed by Gangeyabhooshani, the 33rd Melakartha raga. The number was &#8216;Evvare Ramayya neesari&#8217; in Adi tala.The Yadukulakamboji number was again &#8216;Hechcharikagaa rare Sree Ramachandra&#8217; in khanda chapu. Todi, &#8216;Nee daya radha&#8217; in Adi, had his stamp all over the piece.  He concluded with a soothing Madhyamavathy, &#8216;Sree Rama Jaya Rama&#8217; in khanda chapu.Senior musicians M. Chandrasekharan (violin), Guruvayur Dorai (mridangam) and Uduppi Sreedhar (ghatom) gave the musician excellent accompaniment.The festival was organised by the Thrissur-based musical outfit Nadalaya Pravah Academy of Music that was founded by  percussionist Trichur R. Mohan more than 15  years ago.
