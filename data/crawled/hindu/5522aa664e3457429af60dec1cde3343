VIt was a night of enthralment forrasikasin Palakkad, as Carnatic vocalist Ayankudi Mani took to the stage at the Palghat Fine Arts Society auditorium. Mani, a disciple of  maestros such as Vechoor Harihara Subrahmaniam, Pudukkode Krishna Moorthy and Parassala Ponnammal, has created a niche for himself, with his impeccable artistry and immense creativity in the exposition of ragas and laya-laden swarakalpanas. The skill and flourish with which he presented ragas and kritis were much appreciated.With the able support of M.N. Moorthy on the violin, V. Raveendran Nair on the mridangam and Anjal Krishnayyar on the ghatom, the vocalist started off  the concert with the majestic Ata tala varnam &#8216;Sarasijanabha ninnu&#8217; of Swati Tirunal, in raga Kamboji.&#8216;Mahaganapathim manasa smarami,&#8217; a composition of Muthuswami Dikshitar in Natta, set to Adi tala, and a Swati Tirunal kriti &#8216;Mamava sada jananee&#8217; in  Kaanada, set to Roopaka tala, were adorned with pleasing swarakalpana sequences and meticulous laya.The demanding raga Begada was portrayed in its  full version within a short duration, followed by the composition &#8216;Va Muruka, Vadivazhaka,&#8217; set to Roopaka tala,  and manodharma swara thereafter.Ragalapana of Reethigowla brought out many facets of the raga&#8217;s melody. A rare composition of G.N.B, &#8216;En manathamarai mele thaye un padam veitharul maye&#8217; set to Adi tala was also well received by the rasikas.The scholarly rendition of the seldom-heard Panchama varjya raga, &#8216;Hamsavinodini,&#8217; derived from the 29th melakartha, &#8216;Dheerasankarabharanam,&#8217; sung in madhyama sruti was  proof of his expertise.&#8216;Saranam mama karunamaya&#8217; of Narayana theerthar, set to Roopaka tala was embellished with manodharma swara.The brisk item &#8216;Marivere dikkevvaro,&#8217; a composition of Pattanam Subrahmania Iyer, in  Lathangi, set to Khandhachappu tala and laced with lilting swaraprasthana, was an apt interlude before taking up the expansive alapana of Bhairavi, which subtly illustrated every nuance of the raga. Essays on the violin by M.N.Moorthy were equally creative. &#8216;Balagopala palayasumam&#8217; of Muthuswami Dikshitar, set to Adi tala  was decorated with artistic niraval and manodharma swara at the charana. The thaniavartanam of Raveendran and Krishnayyar was also superb.A padam of Swati Tirunal &#8216;Alarsara parithapam,&#8217; in raga Surutty, set to Misrachappu tala, was taken up from the anupallavi, &#8216;Jalajabadhuvumiha.&#8217; The vocalist wound up the concert with a thillana of the violin maestro Lalgudi Jayaraman in Ragesree and the mangalam &#8216;Bhujagasayino&#8217; of Swati Tirunal in Yadukulakamboji.The concert was organised by Palghat Fine Arts Society.
