VThe third day of the nine-day celebrations of Hamsadhwani's 20 {+t} {+h} anniversary featured the Malladi Brothers' vocal concert titled &#8216;In One Voice.' Known for their assiduous approach to classicism, the siblings did not disappoint the sizeable audience. The brothers with their voice complementing and contrasting each other, gave a galloping start to the recital with the upbeat Darbar varnam &#8216;Chalamela.'A brief profile of Kedaram and Tyagaraja's &#8216;Rama Neepai Tanaku' with restricted swara sallies was followed by &#8216;Vedadri Sikara Narasimha' of Narayana Tirtha in Khambodi that had a lively swara exchange. Ravi Kumar's powerful vocals delineated the rare Kumudakriya with a tinge of Hindustani flavour traversing the range that was, indeed, more like walking on a razor's edge. His touches were finely perceived and neatly executed. Dikshitar's &#8216;Ardhanareeswaram' was elegant and here too there was a swara addition with shadjam as the central note.Amazing nuancesDoes one need to expound the raga in detail to bring out its subtle shades and the finer aspects? Not necessarily. The Malladi Brothers' rendition of Tyagaraja's &#8216;Teliyaleru Rama' in Dhenuka explored attractive and poignant nuances of the raga.Bhairavi, the major raga, was dealt by Sriram Prasad in his supple and soft voice. Surprisingly, there were no pregnant pauses or long karvais; the raga alapana was actually built with racing phrases; yet a raga such as Bhairavi offered scope for the singer to emphasise and strengthen the phrases in right measure. Papanasam Sivan's &#8216;Sri Viswanatham' was a worthy pick and an elaborate niraval and swarakalpana were shared by the siblings on the line &#8216;Annapoorneswari.' &#8216;Shadananane' in Khamas by Dikshitar was lilting filler.A tendency to indulge in swarakalpana for every kriti with an eye for applause seems to have become mandatory for the brothers. It would be better if they employ discretion before such successive swara sessions, which could become rather stale and repetitive.Embar Kannan's violin added extra space with the ragas and swaras. His exposition of Kumudakriya and Bhairavi demonstrated his depth of comprehension and style of execution. K. Arun Prakash and Chandrasekhara Sharma on the mridangam and the ghatam added lustre with their sincere support and an inspiring thani.Active, not aggressiveGayathri Venkataraghavan's concert was a perfect blend of classicism and dynamism. The inspiring Daru in Khamas, &#8216;Mathe Malayadhwaja' by Muthiah Bhagavathar, provided the sparkling start. Even the solemn Varali that followed turned lively when Gayathri moved briskly with the Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Seshachala Nayagam' and niraval with swaras in &#8216;Aravindra Badra Nayanam.' It was active without being aggressive.Sriranjani's charm was unravelled through the many layers of extended phrases and brigas. It is always a pleasure to listen to Gayathri's raga expositions as she is one artist who allows the music to control her singing. Tyagaraja's &#8216;Maru Balga' and its finely framed sangatis and swaras showed the artist's ingenious impulse.Sankarabharanam was her main presentation. Here, Gayathri's articulation was artistic, interestingly imaginative and intellectually stimulating. She chose Subbarama Dikshitar's &#8216;Sankaracharyam' to affix the grand alapana.The unhurried kriti rendition gained momentum once Gayathri struck on the niraval at &#8216;Parama Gnana' building it to a powerful crescendo. The team work of Padma Shankar on the violin, Manoj Siva on the mridangam and Anirudh Athreya on the ganjira elevated this and the swarakalpana followed with many permutations to take the concert greater heights.There always exists perfect chemistry between Gayathri's vocals and Padma Sankar's violin; both shared the honours of the raga exposition, niraval or swarakalpana in equal measure. The magnificence of Sankarabharanam was supplemented by a scintillating thani evenly divided between Manoj and Anirudh.The other gems in the programme titled &#8216;Classical Gems' were &#8216;Varalakshmi Bhajare' in Sowrashtram by Muthuswami Dikshitar, &#8216;Srikantha Nee' in Bhavapriya by Tyagaraja, &#8216;Nenjukku Neediyum' in Sindhubhairavi by Subramanya Bharati and &#8216;Bhavayami Gopala' in Yamuna Kalyani by Annamacharya.
