VMusic, said Leo Tolstoy, is the shorthand of emotions. And if the music originates from such a soothing instrument as the flute then that experience is magnified. In this connection it is noteworthy that Sargam Audios has released &#8216;Muraleeravam,&#8217; an audio cd  featuring a Carnatic flute concert by  A. K. Reghunathan.The opening number is the oft-heard  &#8216;Mahaganapathim,&#8217; an invocation to Lord Mahaganapathy by Muthuswami Dikshitar in raga Natta. Starting with a crisp alaapana, he gently glides into the kriti and concludes with a few kalpanaswaras, which merge well with the kriti.This is followed by Tyagaraja&#8217;s  &#8216;Bhaagaayanayya&#8217; in Chandrajyothi,  a derivative of the 41st melakartha raga, Paavani. The beauty of this Nishaadavarjya raga is unveiled through an effective alaapana. The  kriti is well rendered, with good padantara and suffused by kalapanaswaras.  Suddhagaandaram and the &#8216;ma pa da sa da&#8217; phrase often appear emphasising  the essence  of the raga.Next, is &#8216;Paramapurusham&#8217; in Lalithapanchamam, a  Swati Tirunal  kriti with elegant chittaswaras in varied patterns.  A detailed alaapana of Abheri provides the perfect platform for &#8216;Nagumo,&#8217; the popular kriti of Tyagaraja  fitted with swara passages. The perfectly rendered &#8216;Ennathavam cheythane Yasodha,&#8217; a Papanasam composition in Kaapi concluded the rendition.Reghunathan  has incorporated  popular as well as  rare compositions to appeal to a wide audience.The kritis depicted are rich in music and melody. The totality of any concert depends on the support by fellow accompanists.Accompanists Edappally Ajithkumar (violin), K. Jayakrishnan (mridangam) and Vellattanjoor Sreejith (ghatam) have proved themselves in this regard.  Ajithkumar has faithfully followed Reghunathan throughout the performance and his solo sequences for the alaapana of Chandrajyothi and Abheri as well as for manodharma swaras were superb. Jayakrishnan and Sreejith through their controlled rhythmic phrases also played a vital role in enhancing the level of the concert. Their tani for the Abheri piece was a spirited one.Classical kritis on fluteSinger: A.K. ReghunathanSargam AudioPrice: Rs. 75
