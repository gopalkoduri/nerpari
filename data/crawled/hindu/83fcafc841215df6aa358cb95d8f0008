The 90-minute long programme saw the vocalist moving through Thumri, Dadra, Chaiti, Kajri forms of semi-classical music that kept the audience spell bound.

Nizami, on Sarangi Pandit Bharat Bhushan Goswami and on tanpura Rajjak Ali.Shyamali began her recital with traditional Thumri in raga Mishra Des, "Kaahe piya mose karata thitholi, ab na jhaanu raja ras ki boli...
