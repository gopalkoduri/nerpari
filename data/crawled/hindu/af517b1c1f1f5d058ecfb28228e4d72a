VThe Department of Culture, Government of Andhra Pradesh, organised a programme of music, titled`Bhakti Sangeetham' at Ravindra Bharati recently. Though it was devotional music, the choice of the artistes was so good that it added certain amount of classicism.Dwaram Lakshmi, granddaughter of late violin maestro Dwaram Venkataswami Naidu, opened the concert that evening. She belongs to the Vizianagaram School and learned from her father Dwaram Bhavanarayana Rao, and M.L. Vasantha Kumari. Being a Hindustani vocalist too, her rendition of devotionals gained vocal appeal. Lakshmi sang devotional songs from several languages. Annamayya'sPodagantimayyainMohana,Kurai Ondrum, and a Tamil devotional of Rajaji,Krishna Nee BeganeinYamuna Kalyani, of Purandara Dasa and aTarangamof Narayana Theertha marked her programme.Charanamule NammitiinKapiof Bhakta Ramadasu was the highlight. A. Jairam on violin and Parupalli Bala Subrahmanyam on mridangam, both from Tirupati, lent good support.A feature titledRamadasu Atmanivedanam, which was designed by A.S. Murthy for Bhakta Ramadasu Project, followed this. Ace singer K.B.K. Mohanraju rendered a selection of Ramadasu compositions each preceded by a small epilogue on the particular composition with reference to Ramadasu's life, for almost all the lyrics he wrote were the output of his own experiences.TarakamantramuinDhanyasi,Ye Teeruga NanuinNadanamakriya, andAdigo BhadradriinVarali,Anta RamamayaminMohana, were some of the songs rendered on the occasion.Vedavathi enthrallsVedathavathi Prabhakar is one of the finest singers of devotional both with classical and light classical flavour.
