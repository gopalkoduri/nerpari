VThe festival began with a felicitation of  musicians and dancers for  outstanding contribution to their  fields. While R. Vedavalli was awarded Nada Kalanidhi, Kalanidhi Narayanan was awarded Natya Ratna. While Radha Venkatachalam and Malladi Brothers (Sriram Prasad and  Ravi Kumar) were awarded Nada Bhushanam, Meenakshi Chittaranjan and Rajeshwari Sainath were awarded Natya Ilavarasi. Delhi Yuva Kalakar, the awards for Delhi artistes, were given to P.B. Kannakumar, V.S.K. Annadurai and Jahnavi Rajaraman.A panel discussion on &#8216;Traditions in Music and  Dance&#8217; was also part of the festival.  While dance critic Leela Venkataraman moderated the discussion, the participants included  the award winners and Delhi-based Bharatnatyam exponents Saroja Vaidyanathan and Geeta Chandran. While dwelling on how an artiste  can bring out  bhava  to the fore, the panel concluded that the ultimate objective of artistes  pursuing art should be for art&#8217;s sake. The experience and maturity that an artiste gets over a period of time was identified as another important factor.Elsewhere in the Capital, at the  Delhi Tamil Sangam auditorium, the energetic singer with a vibrant voice,  Sanjay Subramanian connected instantly with  the rasikas. A concert in which such a rapport remains intact is certainly bound to be an enjoyable experience for both the artiste and  the rasikas. Sanjay&#8217;s vocal concert on the first day of the Bharat Sangeet Utsav 2008, organised by Carnatica and  Delhi  Tamil Sangam, was a treat.After presenting &#8216;Sree Parvathi&#8217;, a composition of Kunakudi Krishna Iyer in Sri raga, Sanjay sang  a scintillating &#8216;Hanumane Swamikinda&#8217; in  raga Malayamarutham, a composition of Arunachala Kavi. He spruced it up with lively swaraprastharas.The hallmark of Sanjay&#8217;s presentation, &#8216;Ramadi Rama&#8217;, a composition of Tyagaraja in Darbar, was a fine alap of the raga. Soon after presenting a detailed and fine sketch of another raga Kalyani, Sanjay presented a Thiruppavai verse &#8216;Ambarame Thaneere&#8217;. He also packed his recital  with nerval of the phrase &#8216;Sem por kazhaladi chelvaa bhaladheva&#8217; and swaraprastharas that were rich in creativity.As his main presentation, Sanjay took up Swati Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Rasa vilasa&#8217; in  raga Khamboji. He brought out the raga and the sahitya bhava of this composition to the fore. In addition, the improvisation techniques (rendering of the raga and  swaraprastharas) that he adopted enriched his presentation.Varadarajan on the violin and Neyveli Narayanan on the mridangam provided excellent support to Sanjay. The understanding that all the three artistes had amongst themselves and the team spirit that they displayed was another crucial factor for the overall outcome of the concert.Sanjay Subramanian started learning violin at the  age of seven from V. Lakshminarayana. He then switched to vocal music and received his initial training from Rukmini Rajagopalan, his grand-aunt. His subsequent training under Calcutta K. S. Krishnamurthy sharpened his skills further. He continues to receive guidance from nadaswaram maestro Sembanarkoil S. R. D. Vaidyanathan.
