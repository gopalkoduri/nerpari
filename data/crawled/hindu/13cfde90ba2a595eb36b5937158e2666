VThe kirtanas he chose to play were all Tyagaraja compositions. What more is needed to take the kutcheri to an elevated status?The exhilaration of the concert sprang from supreme sowkhyam.Uniform gracefulness  conferred enchantment on every note that blossomed from the strings.The pauses and poises opened up his creative vista. Smoothness and sublimity flowed in the alapanas of  Sriranjani (&#8216;Sogasuga Mridanga Taalamu&#8217;), Hindolam (&#8216;Samaja Vara Gamana&#8217;) and the brief Surutti at the end. Every aesthetically melodic sanchara was going his way.In the Yadukulakambhoji vinyasa imperceptible finesse formed the emotional fabric of the raga. He released conventional sancharas with a mastery of lyricism in the development of Sriranjani and Hindolam. Behind the layers of silken passages there was a rare aspect of depth.Sri Tyagaraja&#8217;s songs contain the power to illumine and the potency to inspire. Properly rendered , the kirtanas cleanse and purify music. That was precisely the impression T.N. Krishnan created with &#8216;Evarani&#8217; (Devamritavarshini) and &#8216;Hechcharikaga&#8217; (Yadukulakambhoji) in particular.  The Hotel hall in which the recital was held provided the perfect setting to tune the rasikas mind to Krishnan&#8217;s sweetness of sound.In the exchange of raga sancharas and swaraprastaras, his daughter was a source of strength.Tiruvarur Bhaktavatsalam (mridangam) touched the elite manner of percussive gentleness. Sharpness of laya patterns, variety of jatis and sound nuances intermingling with tala vidwat vibrancy marked his tani with Vaikom Gopalakrishnan (ghatam). It stood for percussion sensitivity.
