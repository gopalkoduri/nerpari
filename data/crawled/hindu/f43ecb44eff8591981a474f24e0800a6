VWhen melody underlines sangita, the exposition gains in classical elegance. At the hands of  a vidwan, themusic&#8217;s beauty is enhanced  in raga alapana and rendering of songs.We see many musical styles today, but that which emerges with  aesthetic content stands for its distinctive excellence.In these respects, the violin recital of T.N. Krishnan with his daughter Viji Natarajan, conveyed how his music has retained its grace over the years.  His performance for Narada Gana Sabha was Tyagaraja-oriented, exemplifying refinement, experience and consummate reliance on the saint&#8217;s heritage, which proclaimed him great violinist.  The height of his creativity rested on the subtle way in which he sublimated even karvais, not to speak of sancharas in alapana or sangatis in songs.In today&#8217;s context of confusing ideologies,  Krishnan&#8217;s performance stressed that our musical values lay beyond these transient influences. Between the still small voice of the nobility of Carnatic music and the lures of the expanding career environment, Krishnan, through his playing, conveyed where his heart lay.Symbolically, the beginning of the concert, with &#8216;Nada Thanum Anisam&#8217; (Chittaranjani) was obeisance to Nada.The sweetness of his presentation made it exceptional. Interpretative scholarship of Krishnan served the purpose of awakening the rasikas&#8217; appreciation instincts to depth, tenderness and the glow of nuances.Krishnan is noted for the alapanas of rakti ragas. His Khamas (&#8216;Sitapathe Naa Manasuna&#8217;) and later Sahana (&#8216;Ee Vasuda&#8217;) confirmed him as one in whom melody stimulated music and music responded to melody. Finesse rich sanchara felicity in the delineation of the two ragas breathed graciousness. He interested himself in fathoming the  morchanas, punctuated with silences contributing to the overall effect.Khamas in particular was filled with  creative expressions, the bow and fingers programmed to emphasise the raga&#8217;s richness.So the sancharas were delightful with tonal subtleties. His gifts flowed through the sensitive twists and turns in the kirtana&#8217;s sangatis.The intensity of the sahitya emotion took complete possession of him.His Sahana had  brevity and was delicately eloquent. It was musically elevating to an admirable degree.The fascination was not so much in the way he shed light on the beauty of the raga as much as on how its beauty evolved at his hands. His Kalyani alapana, which began with his daughter, was best in range and spectacular in effect. There was lyrical articulation, going beyond the platitudes of exposition.As the development of Kalyani progressed, its attractive features got exhibited. The kirtana was &#8216;Nidhi Chala Sukhama&#8217; rendered doing full justice to its weighty winsomeness.J. Vaidyanathan was the mridangam accompanist. He revealed sound instincts to suit  the nada level of Krishan&#8217;s play.Madipakkam Murali, the ghatam artist, played in perfect understanding with Vaidyanathan.
