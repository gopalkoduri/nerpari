VTo attend a concert by Ranjani and Gayathri is to anticipate an appreciable standard of artistry. Nor did the sisters disappoint. Complementing and contrasting, exploring and discovering, leading and following seamlessly in turn after turn, they pres\u000aented an absorbing vocal recital in the HCL Series of concerts at the Music Academy on Saturday last. The mood of the concert was surprisingly low-key, reflecting the muted tones of a watercolour wash rather than the bright bold strokes of an oil on canvas that one would have expected.The opening piece, Purandaradasa&#8217;s &#8216;Jaya Jaya Jaya Janaki Kantha&#8217; (Nattai) had crisp yet emotive sangatis and kalpanaswaras. After a sensitively-nuanced Tyagaraja kriti, &#8216;Sanatana&#8217; (Phalamanjari), Ranjani made a subdued statement in the Malayamarudham alapana defined by predominantly madhyama kala sancharas, with karvais at a premium, ravai sangatis speeding from and to the tara stayi shadja.For both the vocalist and the violinist the accent was on producing octave-traversing passages. In Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Manasaayetulortuney,&#8217; the easy flow of sarvalaghu swaras led to the well-designed mosaic of the concluding round incorporating the right touches. The weighty sway of Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Maamava Meenakshi&#8217; swung the thrust of the recital towards bhava as voices and violin delved into the cornucopia within reach. The extended halt at the tara stayi shadja at &#8216;Shamey Shankari&#8217; heralded the entry of niraval at these lines, in fitting proportion and with considerable involvement.Sangatis chiselled with sophistication embellished a brisk &#8216;Nee Kela Naa&#8217;, the Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar kriti in Devamanohari. Handling a chittaswaram with asymmetrical permutations can prove a tricky proposition at an accelerated pace. There was a moment when the chittaswaram seemed in imminent danger of going adrift, but an alert Gayathri reeled it in, retaining a firm hold.Gayathri found her muse in the delicately traced contours of Mohanam. The exposition was a thing of beauty. Karvais at the tara stayi shadja and gandhara trailed intricately twined streamers of intellect and emotion. If the Papanasam Sivan composition &#8216;Kapali&#8217; showcased an elegant progression of sangatis, the kizhkala swaras shone with aesthetic conviction. Charumathi Raghuraman (violin) came up with pat responses to kalpanaswaras. Her Mohanam sought to follow the free flowing craftsmanship of the main artiste and succeeded in part.Kritis and manodharma segments were nourished by the percussive support of Manoj Siva (mridangam) and K.V.Gopalakrishnan (kanjira). The thani began on a restrained note, echoing the prevailing mood, and wisely opted to demonstrate the appeal of supple, pithy sollus.
