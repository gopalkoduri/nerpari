VWith a facile, sruti-aligned voice that extended its cooperation to the finer nuances of raga, K.P.Nandhini (of Ramjhi's Isai Mazhalai group) presented music firmly anchored in the classical idiom. Singing under the auspices of Gana Mukundhapriya, the young musician offered a neat sketch of Sriranjani preceding Papanasam Sivan's `Kaanavendaamo,' the concluding kalpanaswara dwelling on appreciable aspects of raga bhava.Another of Sivan's kritis, `Kaa Vaa Vaa' (Varali), saw Nandhini add spice to the swara segment by incorporating a few rounds of tisra nadai permutations at the line `Pazhanimalai.' The composition `Arivaar Yaar Unnai' was a moving piece laced with the poignancy of Mukhari and rendered with feeling. The main raga, Khambodi, was developed neatly in well-ordered stages. Tyagaraja's `Yela Raa Sri Krishna' was sung withazhutham, the kizhkala swaras adopting several different endings before theeduppuand the melkala swaras featuring a tidykuraippuwith handy littlekanakkus. Haricharan (violin) shared an evident rapport with the vocalist and fared well in the raga and swara turns.Bharadwaj (mridangam) played with firm, clear strokes.LALITHAA KRISHNANBottom Template Starts
