VNinety six &#8230; that was the number of Vidya Mandir students seated on the stage to render kritis! What a congregation! One could not have asked for a better way to start the last day of Svanubhava 2010.The Hyderabad Brothers' (Seshachari and Raghavachari) concert was next in order. &#8216;Ennalu Oorage' (Shubapantuvarali, Tyagaraja) was balm to the soul. The brothers took their time answering questions that came up. &#8220;When is one qualified to perform on stage?&#8221; The aspirant was told to be ready with a bare minimum (!) of 150 songs which would cater for the requirement of 10 concerts. They wanted the young blood never to begin with sruti instantly. &#8220;Internalise the nadham from the drone and slowly commence your singing.&#8221;Maiden duetUnity in Diversity, claimed Nithyasree Mahadevan as she paired with Sowmya to sing their maiden duet-on-stage. It was an enjoyable experiment! The highlight was a virutham (was it rather long?) describing the beauty of Rama and Sita as couple nonpareil. Their conversation was humorous enough during the question hour as the singers recalled their childhood years. As for the audience, their reactions were varied. Aymeric from France said, &#8220; Nothing was lacking in the singing by the new pair, Sowmya and Nithyasree. Each of them gave space to the other and one could feel the sense of camaraderie.&#8221; It is Ernesto's (from Mexico), first visit to India and this event provided him a chance to experience first-hand the rich music and dance.The second session of the sixth day was at The Music Academy. Sriram Parasuram and Anuradha &#8216;portrayed' T. Viswanathan (Viswa) to the young and the not so young. &#8220;The idea of prescriptive notation, the challenge of notating gamakas and a vision that had an eclectic outlook - that embraced Hindustani and even Western system of music - were the distinguishing features of this vocalist-flautist.&#8221;Anuradha for her part said, &#8220;Viswa sir made me realise that music is not something that proves a point, it is Vedanta in a nutshell. He taught notation as an art as he felt it was a musical necessity.&#8221;Sriram rendered &#8216;Vazhi Maraithirukkudhu' (Natakurinji) and &#8216;Thaye Yasodha' (Thodi) with delight. The youth responded to this exposition: Sri Sudharshini of Kalakshetra said that the final virutham of Viswa created feelings of being in a temple. Malavika Sarukkai's dance and awesome choreography left Kanya from Arunachal, a dance-student, spellbound. Darshana called this hour an eye-opener.Aymeric from France said, &#8220;I did not know anything about Carnatic music before joining Kalakshetra. The John Higgins story -- how Viswa raised his capacity -- they told us is of immense relevance to my journey in art.&#8221;Svanubhava needs to move to all &#8216;musically famished' areas.
