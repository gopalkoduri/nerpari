VThe item also posed the question what should be Chittai &#8211; the song or the alapana? Sowmya made it plain that a song has to be chittai and for alapana or niraval unrestricted freedom and not the reversal of roles as often heard to-day.Sowmya gave a lasting glimpse to the beauties of the song and the preceding alapana. It was her approach to get at the tone value of musical expression. The simple and straight forward technique was appealing but the image of &#8216;Dorakuna&#8217; it aroused was stupendous. It served to emphasise that weighty music is as much due to the high ideals imbibed from a guru as to the grandeur of the composition sung.The elegant style of Bilahari alapana apart, a rasika could not overlook the felicity of the flow of sancharas with relishable twists and turns.A vein of exuberant fervour permeated the galloping phrasings focussed on the raga&#8217;s lilting grace. As  manodharma merged with the beauteous landscape of the raga the image was at once graphic and exquisite. When she rendered the charana of the kirtana &#8216;Tamasa Guna Rahita Munulaku&#8217; the potency, intensity and glow of Sri Tyagaraja&#8217;s vision could be felt by the listeners.Without detracting from Sowmya&#8217;s competence, the earlier compositions got eclipsed as the Bilahari suite came on the scene. &#8216;Mayatheeta&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla) was sedate.The Dikshitar song, &#8216;Sri Ramam Raghukulabdi Somam,&#8217; somewhat slackened the pace only to pick up with the  Shanmukhapriya alapana followed by the song &#8216;Marivere Dikkevvaru.&#8217; &#8216;Bhavanuta&#8217; in Mohanam sailed on its many sangatis. But the Bilahari was thepiece-de-resistancein the whole concert.Though tenderness of melody formed the basis of Amruta Murali&#8217;s violin, some kind of  timidity ran through her solo sessions of  Shanmukhapriya and Bilahari. The lines of these two were clear and precise but somehow she did not make an impact.  The main charm of the accompaniment of Delhi Sairam (mridangam) was the  restraint in the sound level. Without showing  much faith in mind-boggling patterns, he  played strokes  adding meaning  to percussive support.Melodic stimulation was the decisive factor in following the songs and  painting a picture of laya in his thani.
