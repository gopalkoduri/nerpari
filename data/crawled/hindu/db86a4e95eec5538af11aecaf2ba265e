VGuru Kripa seriesGomathi Sree and R. HariharasubramaniamVDV CreationsAudiocassette &#8211; Price not mentionedAn audio compact disc titled &#8216;Karpagambika Saranam&#8217; has been recently released under the banner of VDV creations. The lyrics and the tuning of the songs  featured in this album are credited to Gomathi Sree.The songs are in simple Tamizh and based on popular melodies with a focus on being light and not offering heavy classical fare.The opening number invoking the elephant-headed God is in Hamsadhwani (&#8216;Mahaganapathe&#8217;). The vocalisation is by R. Hariharasubramaniam. The harmonium accompaniment for this song does not instil a sedate listening mood and is slightly jarring.The names of the Sodasa Ganapathis feature in the lyrics of this number.Gomathi Sree sings the rest of the nine  songs in this album. These include &#8216;Radhe Krishna&#8217; (Hindolam), &#8216;Malai Magal&#8217; (Madyamavathi), &#8216;Karpagambika Saranam&#8217; (Suddha Danyasi), &#8216;Kaliyuga Deivame&#8217; (Kalavathi as per the Hindustani system), &#8216;Vaitheeswara&#8217; (Pantuvarali), &#8216;Annapoorani&#8217; (Kalyani) apart from &#8216;Mangattu Thaye&#8217; on Kamakshi, &#8216;Kollur Vaazhum&#8217; on Mookambika and a song on Hanuman (Anjana).The singing and the lyrics are of average quality without being harsh on the ear.The choral singers and the instrumentalists who play the musical interludes match the quality of the main singers. The orchestration is by R. Dakshinamurthi.
