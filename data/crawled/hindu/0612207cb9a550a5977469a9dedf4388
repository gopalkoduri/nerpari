VIt was a sprightly start by the young French &#8220;Trio a Vent&#8221; (wind trio) on the final leg of a whistlestop tour around India, in what turned out to be a well-paced concert of almost exactly 60 minutes not too long, and, given the rapidly approaching summer, certainly not too short.Fabien Bernoud (oboe) Richard Malblanc (clarionet) Henri Roman (bassoon) gave a polished and refreshingly professional performance, their fingers flying over keys with ease despite being slick with perspiration. Good communication and clean phrasing were the hallmarks of the ensemble, who play together as part of a quintet in the city of Lyon where they all studied music.Their repertoire included French film scores from the early twentieth century composers such as Jacques Ibert and George Auric, who both studied at the Paris Conservatoire and whose work is of a similar neoclassical style. George Auric was one of &#8220;Les Six&#8221; (The Six), anavant gardegroup of composers from southern Paris brought together by surrealist Jean Cocteau, whose music is generally characterised as a reaction to the growing popularity of German composer Richard Wagner and impressionism. He is perhaps most familiar to Indian audiences for the score for Audrey Hepburn&#8217;s film debut &#8220;Roman Holiday&#8221; (1953).&#8220;A lot know Mozart but not French composers,&#8221; bassoonist Henri Roman told Friday Review, as if to say that Indian audiences should also be exposed to the finest of France. It is not only Chennai that has had this privilege. The audiences in Thiruvananthapuram and Chandigargh, Hyderabad and Mumbai, as well as New Delhi, Pune and Bangalore have all heard and responded differently, the trio says.What intrigued the trio was the curiosity that their instruments and their music has provoked throughout the tour. They even incorporated a mini explanation of how the instruments work at the end of the recital the clarionet has only one broad flat reed and makes no sound without its wooden pipe, the others have double reeds and make sounds like mosquitoes when placed in the mouth and blown independent of the pipe. The happy Chennai audience giggled.Trio members spoke of &#8216;next trips,&#8217; &#8216;workshops&#8217; and &#8216;exchanges&#8217; as they were mobbed by wowed well wishers in a makeshift backstage next to the organ loft. Judging by the enthusiasm rustling up a willing crowd next time around won&#8217;t be a difficult task, although a programme might help listeners orientate themselves better (announcements were inaudible) and prevent clapping between movements. The Alliance Francaise, the trio hopes, will continue to provide links to India&#8217;s cities. Until then,bonne chance.
