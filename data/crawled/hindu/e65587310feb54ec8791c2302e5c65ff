VThe Nadasurabhi Cultural Association presented a vocal concert by Sreevalsan J. Menon, accompanied by T.S. Krishnamurthy (violin), K.U. Jayachandra Rao (mridanga) and G. Omkar (ghata).While &#8220;Sami ninne kori&#8221;, the Sri Raga varna in adi thala and &#8220;Jagadanandakaraka&#8221;, the Pancharatna krithi in Natta provided an animated start to the concert, the compact alapana of Shahana and &#8220;Velavane unakku&#8221; in adi thala were expositions of the mellifluous essence of the raga.&#8220;Varalakshmi Namosthuthe&#8221;, the Mysore Vasudevacharya krithi in Gouri Manohari raga and rupaka thala, was succeeded by the reposeful alapana of Purvikalyani that encompassed extended spells at the gandhara, panchama and thara shadja. &#8220;Satileni guruguhamurthy&#8221; set to misra chapu thala featured a lucid and bhava-laden neraval at &#8220;Koti manmatharupude&#8221; and fluent kalpana swaras.An exhaustive alapana of Thodi, steeped in classicism, preceded Kumara Ettendra&#8217;s magnificent &#8220;Gajavadana sammoditha veera&#8221;, rendered with equal emphasis on the lyrics and the musical structure.Among the concluding items were &#8220;Narayana&#8221; in Shuddhadhanyasi and &#8220;Sagarashayana vibho&#8221; in Bagesri. The concert on the whole, was characterized by strict adherence to tradition, clarity of articulation, technical prowess, creativity, and sensitivity to the underlying bhava of ragas and compositions.***Hemmige S. Prashanth, accompanied by Nalina Mohan (violin), B.R Srinivas (mridanga) and Vyasa Vittala (kanjira), presented a vocal concert under the auspices of the Nadaranjani Sangeetha Sabha.The recital commenced with &#8220;Sarasijanabha&#8221;, the ata thala varna in Kamboji, followed by a brisk rendering of &#8220;Shiva shivayanarada&#8221; in Panthuvarali and a few short kalpana swaras.A brief alapana of Harikamboji preceded the Thyagaraja krithi set to rupaka thala &#8220;Rama nannu brovara&#8221;, sung at an unhurried pace and embellished with some appealing sangathis.Anandabhairavi was taken up for a melodious alapana followed by the Deekshithar krithi &#8220;Manasa guruguha&#8221;, supplemented with kalpana swaras suffused with raga bhava. &#8220;Hariharaputhram&#8221;, the Deekshithar composition in Vasantha raga was next presented in a leisurely tempo and served as a prelude to a detailed elaboration of Keeravani, the main raga of the concert.The meticulous expansion of the raga featured long rests at focal points interspersed with meandering sancharas and briga-oriented passages, augmented by the violinist&#8217;s tuneful accompaniment, though the heavy classicism of the Anandabhairavi ensemble appeared depleted.The vocalist&#8217;s firm grounding and improvisational powers were in evidence throughout the concert, reinforced with appropriate support from the accompanying artistes.
