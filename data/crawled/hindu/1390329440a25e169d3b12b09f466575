VThe striking basic similarities between classical Carnatic music and Hindustani music serve as a great advantage for the aficionados of Indian music in general.The best of the both genres was exploited fully by Mala Ramadorai, during her Hindustani recital at Hamsadhwani.Mala Ramadorai  offered  a variety of ragas with a little more prominence on the khayals. With her mellifluous voice at its best, she could travel and touch the finer nuances of each melody at the same time, enough lyrical adornment also integrated into it.Mala  began  and concluded her recital with Lalitha Dasar&#8217;s kritis. &#8216;Ganapathiye&#8217; in Hamsadhwani initiated her proceedings. Raag Marwa, bearing the shades of Hamsanandi, opened up delicately, the sancharas echoing the characteristic notes of the raga.The khayal &#8216;Piya More Aa&#8217; dripping with the customary &#8216;viraha ras&#8217; followed in slow and fast rhythm.The niraval in &#8216;Piya Bin Jiayara&#8217; with swaras added  flavour to it. Nand Kalyan with all its vivacity of Behag and the brisk khayal &#8216;Oh Bale Saiyan&#8217; carried an infectious gaiety and the innumerable  sangatis Mala brought in this particular raag were immensely pleasing.The mesmerising phrasings of Kalavati filled the air briefly and Mala  presented a dhurit number &#8216;Tan Man&#8217; with its lilting charm.The majesty of Nattai had transformed into glowing pliable notes of Jog and &#8216;Piharu Bago&#8217; and &#8216;Sajan More Ghar Aaye&#8217; unfolded all the resplendent shades of the raag.Mala&#8217;s music focusses on illuminating the sunny expressions of the raag with her sweetened vocal chords traversing the smooth glides, sensitive akaras and stretched out sruti aligned karvais.On the whole, Mala Ramadorai&#8217;s exercises were delicately feminine and artistically structured making the listening ethereal.The last segment carried a thumri &#8216;Kaahe Aise Preet&#8217; in bright Binna Shadj, &#8216;Barsan Laagi&#8217; in poignant Peelu, a bubbly Holi song in Bhairavi landing on the Sindhubhairavi Lalithadasar kriti &#8216;Jaya Jaya Sri Giri Rajakumari.&#8217;The enticing designs of Bhairavi (Sindhubhairavi) indeed gave wonderful feel and touch for the grand finale.Mala Ramadorai was  supported by Uday Karpoor on the tabla and Prashanth on the Harmonium. Their presence was significantly evident by their total underplaying.
