VVyloppilly Samskriti Bhavan, Thiruvananthapuram,  was the venue for a Carnatic music recital by  T.K. Govinda Rao. The Koothambalam  was  an  ideal setting for the two-hour-long performance by the octogenarian artist, who is a disciple of the legendary Musiri Subramania Iyer.Admirers of traditional classical music were treated to a scintillating performance. The compositions chosen were those of Swati Tirunal, Tyagaraja, Purandaradasa and Narayana Theerthar. There was also a thillana composed by the musician himself.&#8216;Sarasijanabha Ninnu&#8217; in Kambhoji, the popular Ada tala varnam of the royal composer,  was the opening piece of the concert.Two more compositions of Swati Tirunal were rendered. &#8216;Padmanabha Pahi&#8217; in Hindolam, set to Adi tala, and the popular &#8216;Ma Mava Sada Janani&#8217; in Kanada, set to Roopaka tala, had the audience appreciating the elaboration of the ragas and singing of the notes.&#8216;Enthavedu Konthu O raghava&#8217; in Swaraswathi Manohari was the next item.   The raga is a jainyam of the 28th memelakartha raga Harikambhoji.  The composition, not often heard these days, was relished by the senior citizens among the audience; for many it revived  memories of an era gone by.The main was &#8216;Doraguna Idovandi,&#8217; the melodious Tyagaraja composition, in Bilahari, set to Adi tala.  The ragalapana of Bilahari by the vocalist and the violin artiste Thiruvananthapuram R. Mahadevan were profusely applauded.The thani avarthanam by Thiruvananthapuram L. Gopalakrishnan (mridangam), Udupi Srikanth (ganjira) and Pattom Sajikumar (morsing) enhanced the  rhythmic support. A ragamalika  by Purandaradasa was portrayed with finesse by the vocalist.  The penultimate piece of the  concert was a thillana in  &#8216;Gambaeeravani.&#8217; He concluded with a  Tharangam by Narayana Theertha, taken from Krishna Karnamrutham.The selection of compositions and Govinda Rao&#8217;s rendering made it a memorable concert.  Another noteworthy feature of the performance was the rapport among the artistes, with the  vocalist constantly  guiding, encouraging and involving the other musicians too.
