VB. RAMADEVIRasikas are enjoying a feast of music thanks to the 15-day music festival organised by Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore,  at Nani Palkhiwala Auditorium.On the inaugural day, O. S. Thyagarajan dedicated his concert to Lord Siva, on account of Pradosham. From the first varnam in Sahana, `Karunimpa,' till the mangalam, his music sustained vigour and enjoyment. He sang "Ilalo Pranatharthihara" in Atana by Thyagaraja, `Ananda natamaduvaar' in Purvi kalyani by Neelakanta Sivan, `Pirava varam thaarum'( Lathangi) , `Samagana lolane'(Hindolam) and `Karpaga manohara' (Malayamarutham) by Papanasam Sivan. `Thiruvadi charanam' in Kambodhi by Gopalaskrishna Bharathi was the `piece de resistance.' There was absolutely no attempt to impress.Varadarajan's violin had the vivacity of the youth and the depth of diligent work. K. V. Prasad, the stalwart, wove an astonishing pattern in laya during the thani.`Eppo Varuvaaro,' had no gimmicks and faithfully portrayed the longing of the nayaki for the Lord. `Kaana vendaamo', `Theruvatheppo nenje' and `Naale nalla naal' inspired and uplifted with their meaningful lyrics. The wholesome fare came to an end with a thillana by Ponnaiah Pillai in Sankarabharanam. Niranjana Srinivasan, a young disciple of Lalitha Sivakumar, sang with energy and enthusiasm.ElaborateN. Vijay Siva delighted the connoisseur and as well as the uninitiated. His concert began with "Era naapai" a varnam in Todi. He presented ``Paahi sri giriraja suthe" in Ananda Bhairavi by Shyama Sastri, `Sri Sundararajam Bhajeham' in Panthuvarali by Muthuswamy Dikshithar and `Buddhi raadhu' in Sankarabharanam by Thyagaraja elaborately.The RTP in Natabhairavi was crisp with the pallavi, `Aananda natabhairaveesha, jagadeesha.' He included Anandabhairavi and Bhairavi during the neraval and swaraprastharas. `Sangitha shastra gnanamu' in Mukhari by Thyagaraja, was a lovely composition listing out the things that make life pleasant and enjoyable. `Thaaye Tripura Sundari' in Suddha saveri was pleasant. He sang `Ninnai sharanadainthen' by Bharathiar in Yamuna kalyani and `Sri Sharada Bhujangam' by Adi Shankara in ragamalika consisting of eight ragas.The jawali in Kannada, `Maathada baradeno' was by Bangalore Nagarathinammal. Vijay Siva concluded his concert with a Thiruppugazh in Mohanam, having served a delectable fare full of variety and taste.Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi followed the vocalist like a shadow but rose as a powerful force during the alapana, neraval and swaraprastharas.N. Manoj Siva on the mridangam and B. S. Purushothaman on the kanjira were very well matched and in their true elements.Ramaswamy Venkateswaran, who sang in the afternoon, showed great promise. He exhibited good raga and laya gnana and was at ease while singing the lighter songs.But adding a little more spirit to his singing will stand him in good stead.Bottom Template Starts
