VSantoor artiste Alamkode G. Haridas, a disciple of maestro Pandit Shiv Kumar Sarma and a science teacher by profession, succeeded in striking a chord with rasikas at a 90-minute concert held at the Kalpanayaki Mandapam in connection with the Navaratr\u000ai celebrations.Earlier referred to as the &#8216;Shata tantri veena,&#8217; the 100-stringed dulcimer-like santoor has come a long way thanks to Persian and Kashmiri influences.After a brief lecture-demonstration, Haridas began the concert with the Carnatic raga Devamanohari, which is similar to Narayani in Hindustani.Through deft moves and gentle strokes of the strings, Haridas delineated the raga and the alaap in all  their richness, bringing out  it&#8217;s essential bhakti bhava.He traversed up and down on the Santhoor , moving through the Hindustani format of vilambit, madhyalay and druth taal. Then Haridas, accompanied by Satish on the tabla,  played the jhod-jhala in a fast tempo, followed by gath, which is a plain combination of notes.The listeners were wonderstruck at the ease with which Haridas played both the Hindustani and Carnatic styles of music. The meend, akin to the gamaka prayog in Carnatic music, to sustain the musicality of the swaras, added grace to the raga.In keeping with the Sufi tradition of the instrument, Haridas also played a folk tune. Set in Madhyamavati, the lyrics penned by Alamkode Leelakrishnan, gave expression to the longing of a damsel.Shades of Sivaranjini, Bageswari and Bhimplas added luster to the composition.However, the poor acoustics at the venue played spoilsport with the concert. The  concert was organised under the aegis of the  Ramavarmapuram Grama Samudayam, Thiruvananthapuram, as part of it&#8217;s Navarathri celebrations.
