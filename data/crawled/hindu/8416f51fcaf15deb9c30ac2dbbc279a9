VThe surging crowds recently in front of Ghanshyamdas Birla Sabhagar brought back nostalgic memories of the days when enthusiasts would sit on the tramlines to listen to great masters during nightlong soirees. The four days of contagious fervour prove\u000ad the words of Jayant Kastuar, Secretary, Sangeet Natak Akademi, right. His inaugural address acknowledged Kolkata as the best venue for &#8220;thumri rang&#8221;.Thumri, like a bouquet of flowers, displays bhava-rasa-abhinaya (roughly translated as emotion, sentiment and acting). On the canvas of a basic raga several emotive strokes of other ragas add strong dramatic colours. Besides virtuosity, adequate aesthetic sense of melody, rhythm, emotion, voice-throw, bol-banao (weaving lyrics with melodic phrases), etc. are essential for its appeal.It is known that with changing socio-economic scenes public tastes keeps changing. Though the concept of thumri can be seen in Shrimad Bhagwat Puran (Krishna-raasleela), Bharatmuni&#8217;s nayak-nayika-bhed, Kalidasa&#8217;s &#8220;Malvikagnimitra&#8221;, this language of emotion kept evolving and since the medieval period, once associated with dance, especially Kathak, its lilting grace enhanced manifold and allowed enormous artistic freedom.This festival aimed at discussing all this, along with thumri&#8217;s major styles. In a morning session Pandit Vijay Kichlu touched every aspect of this highly evolved art form with deep insight. Four evening sessions accommodated three artistes each.  Six Kolkata-based artistes were especially impressive with their superb virtuosity.Vidushi Girija Devi could present only two of her priceless pieces due to the prolonged, eager display of Ustad Mashkoor Ali Khan,  but she swayed all with her &#8220;Babul mora naihar chhuto jaye&#8221;. The moving grand finale was thus scripted by the septuagenarian doyenne of the Benaras gharana.The varied character of Benarasi thumris, deftly rendered by Purnima Chowdhury, made her presentation, as always, full of life, lilt and colour. If her bandishi thumri (khayal-like) was slow, her ghanakshari (heavily lyric-laden) was full of verve.Her mastery over rhythm makes her very special in this arena where baant (division), chhand (rhyming rhythmic patterns), layakari (variation in tempo), laggi (high-speed allotropic display of tala) play pivotal roles.Subhra Guha&#8217;s rendition, beautifully supported by her disciple Sanjukta Biswas, was essentially very soft, soothing and deeply emotive with soul-stirringpukars&#8212; literally calling out one&#8217;s beloved in anguish. Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty&#8217;s superbly ornate thumris did justice to the Punjab ang. His opening Meerabai ki Malhar came as a refreshingly different raga.Pandit Chhannulal Mishra, an extremely witty, articulate singer from Benaras, charmed all with his lively thumris. According to him, the thumri was brought by Krishna from Indra-sabha (court of the king of the gods). Savita Devi and Shanti Hiranand were impressive. Among others were Jagdish Prasad, Rita Ganguli, Sucharita Gupta and Murad Bano. Though SNA excluded accompanists from its invitation cards and brochure, many, like Ghulam Sabir Khan and Roshan Ali (sarangi) or Lalit Kumar (tabla), breathed life into the recitals.
