VThis was reflected in the interpretation of kirtanas and articulation of raga alapanas. Her uncanny insight into the core of Carnatic music carried the concert to a high level. Her management of the kutcheri called for respect from the rasikas.Till the Thodi ragam, tanam and pallavi towards the fag end of the recital, the listeners had to be content with a low-key exposition.The alapanas of Arabhi (&#8216;Paalimpa Raava Demira&#8217;) and Vachaspati (&#8216;Kanta Joodumi&#8217;) lacked sparkle that is normally associated with Sudha Raghunathan&#8217;s music. There was competence in the compositional aspect of treatment but the effort was not richly motivated. The manodharma stood separated from arresting vocal manipulation. This revealed one basic truth.Whatever the reputation of the artiste, a major raga in the mid-section of a concert followed by a monumental kirtana alone can impart weight and grandeur. Sudha Raghunathan is quite conversant with what makes a recital top class, but the soft stuff  made it tame.&#8216;Sobillu Sapta Swara&#8217; (Jaganmohini) and &#8216;Sarasadala Nayana&#8217; (Khamas) raised hopes of a good fare, but the two others, &#8216;Guruvaayurappane Appan&#8217; (Ritigowla) and &#8216;Parthasarathe&#8217; (Panthuvarali) failed to register well. The solo versions of  violinist Sriramkumar were smartly programmed and folded up the raga pictures in delightful warmth.While they were a measured response to the vocalist&#8217;s presentation, the sancharas were sharply tuned to the characteristic shades of the ragas emphasising how his sadhaka and dedication had ripened his playing style. There was a flow of fluency and effortlessness.Percussive support came from Skanda Subramaniam (mridangam) and Raman (morsing). The tapestry of patterns that the former deployed while playing for kirtanas was both gentle and firm. But the thani was extended to wearisome length.Vasundhara Rajagopal&#8217;s performance for the Krishna Gana Sabha had two distinct contents. The early part consisting of &#8216;Teliyaleru Rama&#8217; (Dhenuka) and &#8216;Naadaadinamaata&#8217; (Janaranjani) was sober and sedate. The latter half was rakti prone with &#8216;Rangapura Vihara&#8217; (Brindavana Saranga) and &#8216;Endudaakinado&#8217; (Thodi).Based on a flexible, mobile voice, the kutcheri revealed solid endowments. Her handling of raga alapanas and rendering of songs were presented with vividness and consistency.Her first vinyasa of Janaranjani and the next one, Ramapriya (&#8216;Sri Vasudeva&#8217;) drew the attention of the listeners as to how well they were worked out with restraint. There was nothing counterfeit in her developmental method.The Janaranjani kirtana stood for sampradaya patanthara. Persuasively she laid before the rasikas the structural pattern of the song. So was the Dhenuka and Ramapriya items.The Brindavana Saranga piece, &#8216;Rangapura Vihara&#8217; preceded by a viruttam, was the outstanding item in the kutcheri both by its emotional and elevating impact. In the creative process of Thodi, it was more than mechanical expression. The well-rounded felicitous sancharas were delightfully integrated with harmony and balance. The many sangatis in the pallavi of the song, &#8216;Endudaakinado&#8217; carried not only erudition but also precision and clarity. The song&#8217;s grandeur and nuancic intricacies were well brought out.Hemalatha on the violin wrapped up her solo versions of the ragas with elegance displaying finery. Mridangam accompaniment by Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar was dynamic without being intrusive.
