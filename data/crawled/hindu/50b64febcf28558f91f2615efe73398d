VThe Capital, all of a sudden, seemed to be witnessing the visit of &#8216;big ticket' Carnatic musicians from Chennai in quick successions. The three-day thematic music festival, titled &#8220;Bhakthi Pravaham&#8221;, organised by Shree Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha this past week in the auditorium of Delhi Tamil Sangam, began with a flying start with the concert of Bombay Jayashri Ramnath. Jayashri did a splendid job not only in well thought-out selection of compositions on Lord Shiva and Goddess Shakti (under the theme &#8216;Shaktiyum Shivanum' given to her), but also interweaved her creative talent to make it a memorable evening.The best feature in Jayashri's recital was the ragam-raanam-pallavi session. She presented the pallavi &#8220;Rupini chitrupini nadaswarupini omkara rimkara&#8221; in raga Sivasakthi and in Khanda jati tripuda tala, with the pallavi beginning at &#8216;athitham' (last beat of the tala cycle). Jayashri presented a scintillating sketch of this raga, which differs from the raga Varamu (or Suddha Hindolam) due to the absence of the note Ni in the arohanam of the raga Sivasakthi. While Varamu takes the notes Sa-Ga-Ma-Da-Ni-Sa in arohanam and Sa-Ni-Da-Ma-Ga-Sa in avrohanam, Sivasakthi takes Sa-Ga-Ma-Da-Sa only in the arohanam but takes Sa-Ni-Da-Ma-Ga-Sa in the avrohanam. That she is an accomplished artiste, Jayashri brilliantly handled the entire session including the ragamallika swaraprastharas in both forward and reverse directions. Earlier, Jayashri presented Tyagaraja's &#8220;Ragasudharasa&#8221; in raga Andolika, &#8220;Nannu kanna talli&#8221; in raga Kesari, &#8220;Gati Nivani&#8221; in raga Todi and Dikshidar's &#8220;Sree Mathrubudham&#8221; in raga Kannada.Providing excellent support on the violin throughout the concert, Embar Kannan's sketch of the raga Sivasakthi was delightful. J. Vaidyanathan on the mridangam and Anirudh Athreya on the kanjira, who provided the percussion support, played a tani avartanam (percussion solo) in Adi tala; it t was enjoyable.Tygaraja compositionsIn another festival titled &#8220;Thyagaraja Music Festival&#8221; presented by the same organisation sometime earlier, most of the songs that ace vocalist Sudha Raghunathan presented were those of the legendry composer Tyagaraja. Though not a thematic concert, Sudha was the only artiste in this festival who packed as many as five compositions of Tyagaraja in her concert, doing adequate justice to the title of the festival.While presenting &#8220;Sobhillu sapthaswara&#8221; in raga Jaganmohini, swaraprastharas rich in creativity and the briga usagecame to fore even in the initial stages of the concert. &#8220;Mokshamu galada&#8221; in raga Saramathi and &#8220;Raghuvara nannu&#8221; in raga Pantuvarali were emotively presented. In the latter song, inclusion of neraval and swarasprastharas added value. &#8216;Sogasuga mridanga' in raga Sriranjani and &#8216;Koluvamare gada' in raga Todi, came up for detailed renditions. In detailed alapanas, the complete features of these ragas came to the fore. Further improvisations were in the form of swaraprastharas for the former song. In the case of the latter, it was neraval of the phrase &#8216;Sree karuniki srutha chinthamanuniki' and swaraprastharas.B. Raghavendra Rao on the violin, Poongulam Subramaniam on the mridangam and Alathur Rajaganesh on the kanjira provided able and understanding support to Sudha. While Raghavendra Rao delineated the ragas Sriranjani and todi delightfully, the percussionists' tani avartanam in Adi tala was enthralling.Sadly, Vijay Siva's recital for the Delhi Tamil Sangam was disappointing, partly due to his poor health. R.K. Sreeramkumar on the violin and Manoj Siva on the mridangam provided the much-needed support to Vijay in the concert.
