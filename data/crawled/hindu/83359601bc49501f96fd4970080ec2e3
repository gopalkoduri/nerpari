VThe Government Music School in Tiruchi city has been imparting training in nagaswaram, Thevaram, vocal, tavil and Bharatanatyam,  benefiting students belonging to the lower income group and socially backward communities. It has often been organising programmes inviting noted musical exponents to encourage and inspire the students.There are takers for classes in  nagaswaram and thavil, whereas few opt for other courses, for instance, Thevaram. The music school provides  employment to the students as Odhuvars in temples under the jurisdiction of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE).At a recent function held in the city, clarinet maestro A. K. C. Natarajan appreciated the  music school's endeavour to promote the traditional form of art and culture among all sections of the society.  He honoured 20 students, including girls, who had completed the courses in various disciplines during 2004-05, with a certificate.Continuous processNatarajan appealed to the students to make music learning a continuous  process so that they can understand the nuances of music.He explained the hard work that music students in those days had to undergo under the `gurukulam' system.The Assistant Director of Art and Culture, R. Gunasekaran, said that the students belonging to economically weaker sections were the largest beneficiaries.  of the music school concept.The Department had proposed to organise a regional music workshop shortly for the benefit of the schoolteachers and students, Mr. Gunasekaran added.SYED MUTHAHAR SAQAFBottom Template Starts
