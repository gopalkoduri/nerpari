VThe amazing zest of the 82-year-old Ustad Rahim Fahimuddin Dagar, the senior most representative of the Dagar Bani of Dhrupad, was evident in his decision to take a train as opposed to a flight. He opted for a three-day arduous train journey to Kerala from Delhi instead of a flight to participate in the Spic-Macay National Convention, just to interact with youngsters keen to know about the learned ustad, classical arts,  the Dhrupad style of Indian classical music and about life itself.  Fortunate were the students from across the country who got the rare opportunity to learn and savour the flavour and depth of Dhrupad,  a unique musical art form, during the weeklong convention.The ustad patiently taught them breath control and how to pronounce an &#8216;Aakar&#8217; or &#8216;Oum&#8217; in the swaras of raga Bhairava. Listening to these kids performing an &#8216;auchaar&#8217; (introductory alap) and a saadara (Dhrupad set to Jhap tala) in the morning raga, no one could believe that the ustad had taught them all this in just a few days. He gave them not only practical singing lessons but also a deep understanding of our culture represented through this austere art form. No wonder the youngsters attended his evening concert with rapt involvement, where he sang a detailed alapchari, a dhrupad and a dhamar in raga Chandrakauns followed by some captivating compositions in raga Malkauns, Khamaj and Sohani.The veteran ustad believes that it is the responsibility of artistes to educate the audience because they want and need this awareness to enjoy it more. God has given man all the sense organs, but it is the guru (teacher) who should guide what is to be seen with the eyes, listened to with the ears, or the way to talk and behave. Our musical tradition is the tradition of knowledge. Thenaador the musical sound is equivalent to God.He fluently recited a Sanskrit shloka (couplet) to explain this and reiterated that the aim of our music ismokhsaor liberation.  Music is not only an art but also a science he says, where you get practical knowledge of true swara. There is also a clear-cut guideline for this.  Baba Baheram Khan, the founder of the Dagar tradition, says the ustad, stressed on Naad-Yoga  (voice culture) for the initial 14 years of sadhana; which is in fact the way to self-purification. You can express in words only what you know by experience, he says. The arts are nurtured by asaadhaklike a child by his mother.  &#8220;I come here all the way just to make these youngsters aware of their rich tradition. I want to hand over the heritage to the younger generation now,&#8221; he says.
