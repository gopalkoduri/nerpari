V&#8216;S angeeta Pitamaha Purandaradasa Day' was celebrated in Kochi with a concert by O. S .Thyagarajan (OST). Melody reigned as OST sang a number of rare kritis and ragas to a discerning audience.&#8216;Karunimpa,' a varnam in raga Sahana, set the mood for the concert. Most of the rare ragas that OST chose were sombre. For instance, Jayamanohari, which is close in structure to Abhogi (nishadam added to the avarohana of Abhogi gives Jayamanohari), was presented in the rarely-heard melody &#8216;Nee Bhakti Bhagyasudha,' with kalpanaswaras to enrich the feel. Shubhapantuvarali was also poignant and it initiated the array of Purandaradasa compositions starting with &#8216;Neene Anathabandhu.' The detailed raga alaapana was well supported by Mullaivasal Chandramouli on the violin.His forteOST is known for his pure kriti renditions and he stuck to his forte. Next he presented &#8216;Neekela dayaadu' in raga Sarasangi, set to Khanda chapu tala. The fiery swaras had long and splendid korvais ending in mukthaippu. Njanjil Arul on the mridangam was quick to pick up the various permutations. Neat chittaswaras embellished &#8216;Vijayambike vimalambike' in Vijayanagari &#8211; yet another rare raga &#8211; and set to Adi tala.The raga alaapana in Kalyani had many surprising and excellent moments of srutibhedam. Jarus and minor brigas were not disappointing and the vocalist covered the raga comprehensively. A long sustenance in the upper rishabha lead to a srutibhedam, which recurred in a delectable Sankarabharanam during the swaras. The transition was ably replicated by Chandramouli.Purandaradasa's popular devaranama &#8216;Nambikettavarillavo' in Misra chapu tala was presented with precision and finish. The niraval in the line &#8216;Garudagamana purandara vitala' was brilliant. Njanjil Arul's tani was impressive as he played a variety of complex jathis with perfect timing. He was supported by Tripunithura Kannan on the ghatam.OST further delighted the audience with popular songs such as &#8216;Jagadodharana' (Kapi), &#8216;Sada Ennai' (Behag) before winding up with &#8216;Nadupai galigeru' (Madhyamavati). The event was organised by Rasikapriya.
