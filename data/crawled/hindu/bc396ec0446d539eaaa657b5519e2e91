VGayathri Girish sang under the auspices of Shri Ramabhyudaya Sabha as part of Ramotsava celebrations in Mysore. The singer's bold voice fortified by authority successfully engaged the audience. Yet, in her present endeavour, the role played by the selected compositions proved more captivating than that played by inspiration. Dr. Jyotsna Shrikanth (violin), B. Ravishankar (mridanga) and B. Shashishankar (ghata) accompanied the artiste.Of all the presentations, &#8220;Meru Samanadheera&#8221; (Mayamalavagoula &#8212; Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Kaligiyunte Kadha Kalgunu&#8221; (Keeravani-Thyagaraja) drew much attention in matters of both scholarship and depth. Nevertheless, when considered from the angle of the degree of emotive aspects materialised by the mature singer, a serious listener had to face with some disappointment: she could have charged her intonations with more expressions and sentiments.A fluent alapana in Keeravani was methodical, and it was equally so with the melody accompanist. The general tempo of the progressions remaining ideal, the main body of the composition (&#8220;Kaligiyunte&#8221;) was clear, and the diction convincing. Further, observe for example, how neatly she elaborated the charana at &#8220;Baguga Shri Raghuramuni Padamula Bhakthi&#8221;. The singer tunefully reconstructed the syntax to suit the desired mood and meaning. Passages of swarakalpana too imparted due weight to the neraval.After hearing to an expansive alapana in Devamanohari (&#8220;Palukavademira&#8221; &#8212; Mysore Vasudevacharya), one expected at least a few passages of swarakalpana for a better balance and relevance. Further, the brief kalpanaswaras she framed for &#8220;Kanuguntini&#8221; (Bilahari- Thyagaraja) appeared more as an appendage of formality than as an embellishment of noticeable significance.The concert comprised a raga-tana-pallavi mainly in Natakuranji. The pallavi (&#8220;Dasharathe Maam Paalaya&#8221;) paved way for kalpanaswaras in ragas &#8212; Naata, Kaanada, Todi, Valaji, Vasantha, Charukeshi and so on sung with clarity and felicity.***Anil Murthy sings (Shri Ramaseva Mandali Charitable Trust) with involvement, and the voice carries emotion in it: &#8220;Entamuddo Enta Sogaso&#8221; (Bindumalini-Thyagaraja) and the lyrical sections of &#8220;Marivere Dikkevarayya&#8221; served as perfect examples in this aspect.Though the artiste left no doubts as to his competence and potential, it appeared he was treading a path, which was not inconsistent with melodic aspects: the genuine intention was being overpowered and pushed aside by redundant articulations. Take as examples &#8220;Vandanamu Raghunandana&#8221; (Shahana-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Enduku Peddala&#8221; (Shankarabharana-Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Marivere Dikkevarayya&#8221; (Shanmukhapriya- Patnam) for tenable analyses.Alapana in Shanmukhapriya and Shankarabharana (particularly the former) predominantly comprised aggressive bhrigas undermining melody. The artiste voice had to struggle to cope with the surging extempore resulting in gasping for breath, which he could have prevented with composure and method.Adding short pounding bhrikas to the sangathis did not enhance either the raagabhaava or the sahithyabhaava. Instead, they interfered with a smooth flow of those passages. He embellished both the above compositions with swarakalpana-s, with admirable crispness. Nevertheless, for the lack of necessary pauses and smoothness they lost their charm.Raagarathnamalikache (Rithigoula-Thyagaraja) and Rama Naama (Karnaranjani - Gopaladasa) were other interesting inclusions.H.K. Narasimhamurthy (violin), H.S.N. Swamy (mridanga) and S. Manjunath (ghata) accompanied the singer.
