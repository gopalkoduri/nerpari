VIn music circles of north Karnataka, Sangeeta Ratna Pandit Nagnath Wodeyar is a household name. A senior disciple of the Gangubai Hangal, this stalwart of the Kirana-Gwalior gharanas has been recognised for his excellence in Hindustani classical voca\u000al music by the Government of Karnataka with the Rajyotsava award 2006-2007. &#8220;Artistes of the yesteryears performed with a certain depth,&#8221; Pandit Nagnath says. &#8220;That &#8216;ananda&#8217; is missing when we listen to young artistes. Purity, structure, depth and realism are missing these days, while glossy-finishing and gimmickry has taken centre-stage&#8221;.&#8220;Recorders and players are used now to reproduce music, but learning from the Guru directly has always given the best results. The Guru is the final word and is indispensable if you wish to learn holistically.&#8221; As a nine-year-old boy, Pandit Nagnath used to follow singing mendicants.His relative V.H. Inamdar initiated him into music in his hometown Saundatti. Pandit Nagnath soon grasped the nuances of Gwalior gayaki and was ready to study the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya curriculum. After learning for about eight years there, he completed the Sangeet Vishaarad exam.He became a music teacher in a Hindi-medium school in Hubli, in 1964. The turning point came when his uncle Raghvendra Chowte took him to the legendary Vidushi Gangubai Hangal.Recalling his first meeting, he says: &#8220;Vidushi Hangal asked me to sing a raga of my choice. On singing Shudha Kalyan, she was impressed with my swara-taal skills and asked me to come on Dipavali-Balipadyami day. In my first lesson, I was taught &#8216;Shrimaata&#8217; in Raga Komal Rishabh Asavari.&#8221; He reminisces: &#8220;Until then, I used to sing Gwalior gayaki, but when I went to her, Vidushi Hangal clearly instructed me to closely follow her style of gayaki, and unlearn any previously acquired style.&#8221; Slowly people could recognise Gangubai&#8217;s style in Wodeyar&#8217;s singing, as he got into the character of her gayaki.Gangubai taught him with interest and affection. &#8220;Vidushi Hangal guided me very well. For a full 10 years, every evening after school , I used to cycle to her house. Regardless of whether she was in town or not, I would clean the tanpura and sit there singing for two to three hours.&#8221; He notes how daily classes give a certain depth and accuracy in performance.&#8220;My intellectual curiosity led me to explore the emotional depths of each note application, which is true to Kirana gharana style.&#8221;In 1974, Pandit Nagnath became a B-High-grade artiste of AIR Dharwad and there was no turning back. He had many invitations to perform across the country in vocal concerts and for harmonium accompaniment. His proficiency with the harmonium earned him performances along with his Guru and other top-notch artistes, such as Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, Pandit Basvaraj Rajguru, Pandit Arjunsa Nakod and Krishnaa Hangal.Being a musician and holding a job   don&#8217;t affect each other adversely, he believes. &#8220;Everyone may not get monetary success in music &#8211; for financial backup, a job is imperative. I believe &#8216;where there is a will, there is a way&#8217;, so it is possible to put in six to eight hours of practice. I used to spread it across the day, starting with a session in dawn, and then resume riyaz in the evening and night. My family supported me fully, although my brothers were initially apprehensive of music as a profession.&#8221;An able guru, Pandit Nagnath has many students in Hubli,including the well-established Shantala Wattam and Ashok Nadgir. What are the important ingredients to excel in art?&#8220;A good guru, dedication, hard-work and tenacity. With faith in one&#8217;s abilities and passion, one can scale unknown heights.&#8221;Bottom Template Starts
