VIt&#8217;s always motivating to see a women ensemble in Carnatic music platforms. Dr. Bhuvaneswari G. from Ernakulam (at Dharma Prachara Parishad TTD Devasthanam, Vyalikaval) had D. Sunitha on the violin and Vasavi Taranath on the mridanga, all engro\u000assed and immersed in their presentation, oblivious to the pouring crowds who kept walking in and out  to have a darshan of the Lord.The choice of the ragas gained focus in Bhuvaneswari&#8217;s package, as the artiste (Ph.D in music with 22 years of teaching experience in colleges and author of several articles) chose quite a few where the parent-raga &#8220;has a researched background on the therapeutic value in it.&#8221;Shuddha Dhanyasi, Mayamalavagowla, Nagagandhari, Mohana, Shanmukhapriya, Shivaranjani, Bageshri and Nilambari were some of them that were wrapped in kritis of popular vaggeyakkaras and saints. Explaining what the beneficial aspect in a scale really meant to a common listener, she says: &#8220;In the given 72 melakarta ragas, the parent ragas work on the senses of the human being, i.e., it can stimulate the shat chakras - Mooladhara, Svadhishtana, Manipuram, Anahatam, Visuddhi and Ajna. The repeated listening of the particular raga scale produces a network of vibrations that could soothe the harried human system to a large extent, but isn&#8217;t a panacea for serious disorders.It&#8217;s a long process of melodic health exercise&#8230; but choosing ragas for the target audience also makes a marked difference to the aural experience the listener is subject to. Nothing can fall into a pattern, the sahitya and scale can set the mood,&#8221; observes Bhuvaneswari.&#8220;I brought in raga Mohana (janya of Kalyani for the Mooladhara Chakra); Shanmukhapriya and Shuddha Dhanyasi (janya of Kharaharapriya for Svadhishtana Chakra); and Mayamalavagowla for Manipura Chakra,&#8221; she says.She has submitted a proposal to the UGC for a project on the &#8220;Effect of Music on Psychological, Emotional and Behavioural Pattern of Adolescent Students&#8221;.Every piece was a hymn to the Lord, and TTD being the venue, Saint Annamacharya made marked presence with &#8220;Bhavamulona&#8221; in Shuddha Dhanyasi and &#8220;Parama Purusha Nirupamaana&#8221; in Shanmukhapriya.The unhurried pace of Bhuvaneswari also added to the impact wherein the sahitya lent itself to create a mood of bhakti. Be it in Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Sarasijanaabha Sodhari Shankari Pahimaam&#8221; where several lines describe the goddess  or the Nilambari piece of Tyagaraja where the Lord is made to unwind in &#8220;Uyyala Loogavaiya Srirama&#8221;, it was the soft tempo that brought out the meaning in the lyrics better.All in all, it was bhakti that Bhuvaneswari brought out with her co-stars on stage for an evening that not only had musical sounds: violin and mridanga as pakkavadya, but a gamut of other non-musical sounds too - a perpetual clatter and high decibel conversations not just by the visiting public, but also by temple authorities attending to themangalarathi.Is there a prayer greater than music?
