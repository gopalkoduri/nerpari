VThe beauty of music lies in the melodic interpretation of ragas. Kanaka&#8217;s vocal concert under the aegis of Nadabrahma Gana Sabha in Vadavalli, Coimbatore, however, was a mere vocal exercise sans any artistic finesse.Her music sense centred round an academic  interpretation of the songs and swaras.The rendition of the opening varnam, &#8216;Pozhudu Pularndadu&#8217; in Malayamarutham in a full-throated voice belied the expectation of the aficionados.There were no raga delineations as such except a brief sketch of Pantuvarali for an Oothukkadu composition.&#8216;Nadathanumanisam&#8217; in Siddharanjani with swaras was a bonus.Her repertoire included &#8216;Rangapuravihara&#8217;, &#8216;Karya Karana Swaroopa&#8217;, &#8216;Nagumomu&#8217; (Abheri), &#8216;Nambikkettavar Everayya&#8217; (Hindolam), &#8216;Brahmamokate&#8217; and some bhajans.Her presentation of &#8216;Maadu Meikkum Kanna&#8217; (Oothukkadu, Desh) had a strong rhythm and sounded somewhat jazzy.There was no coordination between the vocalist and the accompanists.The artist could do well to hone her skills before embarking on a full-fledged recital.Babu (violin) and Gopikrishna (mridangam) were the accompanists.
