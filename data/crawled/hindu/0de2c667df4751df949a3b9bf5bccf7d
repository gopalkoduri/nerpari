VG.S. PAULSt. Xavier's Forane Church at Velur in Thrissur district witnessed a rare event that commemorated its founder Arnos Pathiri. Select compositions of the Pathiri were set to Carnatic ragas by Fr. Paul Poovathingal and presented by him in a concert as part of the 274th death anniversary of the German missionary.Among the foreign missionaries who had worked in Kerala, Arnos Pathiri's contributions to  Malayalam literature have been monumental. The first translation of the Bible apart, his numerous compositions reveal how he was influenced by the indigenous poets of his times. The widely used `Puthen Paana' was composed on the lines of Poonthanam's `Jnanappaana.' `Ummade Dukham' (Mother's grief) is an ideal elegy that has very few parallels.Outstanding works`Marana Parvam,' `Vidhi Parvam,' `Naraka Parvam,' `Moksha Parvam,' `Umma Parvam' and `Janova Parvam' are outstanding works that have been hailed for their structural beauty and  originality."I could discern the poetic beauty of the lines that are rich in Sanskrit and this made them ideal for Carnatic music," said Fr. Poovathingal, who has earned the sobriquet of `Paadunna Pathiri.'He is perhaps the first priest to earn a doctorate in Carnatic music from Madras University. Fr. Poovathingal felt that music was the right medium to carry Arnos' messages to the people, just like the myriad compositions of thevaggeyakarasof yore.Fr. Poovathingal opened with an invocatory number `Ellaam mangala kaarana daivame'  from `Puthen Paana.'This number helped the  the singer establish a rapport with the audience, mainly members of the church congregation, to whom the number was very familiar as it was in the liturgical text. His selection of raga Charukesi was judicious as it suited the message of the lines.Poignant description`Amma kanya mani thante'  from `Ummade Dukham,' which was a poignant description of Mary's sorrow over the death of her son,  is perhaps the most outstanding among Pathiri's works. Rich in pathos, the piece suited the mood of the  season of lent.  Set in Sahana raga (misra chappu tala),  the slow tempo of the rendition effectively delineated the melancholic mood of the composition. It highlighted the ingenuity of the composer.Pathiri's `Marana Parvam' is  noteworthy for its leitmotif and vivid description.  The piece captures the thoughts of a dying man as he laments that he would miss the sun, the moon, the stars and all the good things in nature.`Bhagya vinasana' taken from `Marana Parvam' was the best in the  the concert. Set to Natta in Adi tala, the composition had a  prolongedalapana.Abdul Aziz's violin complemented the recital. The rhythmic embellishments were provided by  Guruvayur Sanoj (mridangam) and Thrissur A.S. Sajith (ghatam).Bottom Template Starts
