VSeetha Rajan has a lot to offer to listeners, be it on the classicism front, as melody or rare compositions. What's more, she does it all with a smile.She began with the Navaragamalika varnam, its subtle shades intact. Even as she gave the mridangam vidwan Patri Satish Kumar, who rushed to the stage in the last minute, time to settle down, she presented a neat sketch of Asaveri.Her rendition of Tyagaraja's &#8216;Rara Maa Intidaka' brought out the compassion that the saint talks about.Seetha generally includes a vivadhi raga in her concerts. Here too, she chose Neetimati, the 60th melakartha ragam.Ensuring that the vivadi swaras sound pleasant is an art by itself and Seetha handled the raga with ease and expertise. Charulatha Ramanujam (violin) followed the singer neatly.In authentic formAnother speciality of Seetha is singing Dikshitar kritis in an authentic form. The Bowli kriti &#8216;Sri Parvati Parameshwarau Vande' was melodious and scholarly.In the Begada raga alapana, Seetha not only did her part well, but encouraged Charulatha to give her best. Tyagaraja's &#8216;Gati Ganu Nannu' set in the right speed was followed by another slow number, &#8216;Karuna Judavamma' in Varali, sung with devotional fervour.&#8216;Kamala Charane,' a composition of GNB in Amrutha Behag, was a surprise inclusion just before the main Bhairavi. Seetha developed the raga beautifully, stressing on every phrase and brought out the structural beauty of the raga with virtuosity. After a brief tanam, Dikshitar's &#8216;Bala Gopala' flowed.Satish Kumar's melodic rhythm patterns on the mridangam lent an aesthetic effect. Purushothaman on the ganjira gave splendid support. The thani followed the mood set by the vocalist.That Seetha Rajan knows the grammar of Carnatic music was evident when she took up &#8216;Kintucheyvunjan', a Kalyani padam in Malayalam composed by Swati Tirunal.Seetha Rajan wound up with Purandaradasa's Krishnayenabarade.'It was a concert where there was space for the accompanying artists to display their expertise, while still supporting the main artist. Charulatha Ramanujam used the opportunity well.The percussive support by Patri Satish Kumar and B.S. Purushothaman embellished the concert.
