VR.R. Sabha, Tiruchi, conducted a two-day music festival in memory of Maharajapuram Santhanam, in association with Maharajapuram Santhanam Foundation and Nadhadweepam Trust at the FGN Hall, R.R. Sabha, recently.N. Sekar, secretary, R.R. Sabha in his welcome address, thanked all the associate organisations for making the festival a success.The inaugural was presided over by Maharajapuram Nagarajan, who lauded the enthusiasm and interest of the Sabha in spreading the cause of music through such festivals.Pleasant renditionThis was followed by Maharajapuram S. Ganesh Viswanathan's vocal concert. He began with a varnam in Sunadhavinodhini, indicative of the rich fare that was to follow. His rendition of &#8216;Sogasuga' in Sriranjani had all the curves and twists and the kalpanaswaras were imaginative, without being repetitive. He took up Vachaspati (&#8216;Kanta Joodumi') for raga alapana, which was a great listening pleasure with a lot of classical content and bhakti element. Thodi (&#8216;Sri Krishnam') was the main course and the elaborate treatment of the raga was inspiring.Sparkling swarasThe next concert was by Vasudha Kesav, who with her mature voice, sruti alignment and gnanam captivated the audience. Her choice of Hamsadhwani to commence the concert was good with sparkling niraval and swaras. She sang &#8216;Ranganadhude' In praise of the presiding deity of Srirangam. Her attempt of raga Ramapriya for the kriti &#8216;Smaramyagam' was praiseworthy. &#8216;Marukelara' was a filler with a neat rendtion. Kiravani (&#8216;Kalikiyunte') was the main raga taken up with all the ingredients, and was bhava laden.The two concerts were accompanied by Tiruchi Govindarajan and Koviladi Madhwaprasad, who greatly contributed to the success, with their spirited performance.The flute concert by Prapancham Mukyaprana was noteworthy for its gentle and sweet flow of music, with the natural sound of the bamboo holding sway. The blowing was perfect and the melody and fragrance had an enduring appeal.He began with &#8216;Gajavadana' in Sriranjani and the swaras were delineated in great detail. Manoranjani had a brisk pace and was followed by &#8216;Narayana' in Suddha Dhanyasi, popularised by the late maestro Maharajapuram Santhanam.The structuring of the raga was neat covering the entire gamut of the raga. The lower region was attempted through the use of the long bamboo and the effect was mesmerising.The main piece was Kalyani (&#8216;Etavunara') which was short but sweet. The swaras and kuraippu were done briskly.Rare kritiThe concluding concert by Maharajapuram Srinivasan with vocal support by his son was outstanding. He began with a Durbar varnam and the invocation to Lord Vinayaka with a rare song. It was &#8216;Panchmatanga Mukha' by Dikshitar. The swaras were apt and crisp. &#8216;Ragunayaka' in Hamsadhwani was the one taken up for the warm up session and the long kuraippu and the final climax held the listeners' interest.The audience was thrilled with the rendering of &#8216;Nenarunchi' in Malavi. Hindolam was taken up as the sub main and Srinivasan painted a colourful canvas of the raga. Sankarabharanam (&#8216;Rama Ninnuvina') was the central composition and the raga was built by the father-son duo as a monumental edifice.The powerful voices merged in unison and the rich antaragandhara of Sankarabharanam stood out and shone like a pearl.The everlasting melodies of Maharajapuram Santhanam were taken up to the delight of the gathering and concluded with &#8216;Bho Sambho.'The support by N.C. Madhav and Tiruchi Rangarajan for both the concerts was phenomenal and deserves special mention.
