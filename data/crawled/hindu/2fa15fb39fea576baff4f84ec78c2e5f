VMANDAPAKA SARADA has  carved a niche of her own as an  exponent of Carnatic music. She is also one of the very few vocalists who with élan exploit the endowed sweetness in their voices to the hilt both in rendering the composition and surfacing the sublime `raga' and the `layabhaavams'. No wonder, her concerts appeal all alike.Sarada's recent recital for Visakha Music and Dance Academy left an impression of being one such sojourn of knowledgeable exposition of melody.  Having passed the M.A. examination in first rank with distinction from the A.U. Department of Music, she is now happily settled as assistant professor in the same department.  Her Ph.D. thesis highlights the contribution of Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer to Carnatic music. So, she chose to sing all compositions of the great composer on the occasion.Spiritedly getting off to a melodious start with the `Todi varnam' in `Aditalam', she also rendered the `Atatalavarnam' in `Darbar', followed by "Marachedinyayamaa" in `Hamsadhvani' and "Endukituchepalamo" in `Mandari' (a `Janyam' of Kamavardhini) and set an evocatively absorbing tenor.Rendering next `Panchanadeesam' in `Sehana' prefixed with a well-sculpted `aalaapana', "Varameeyavayya" in `Suddhadhanyasi', elaboration of "Karuninchutakide" in `Sindhumandari' (a `Janyam' of Sankarabharanam) and "Nijadaasavarada" in `Kalyani' in quick succession, she transported the mood bordering realms of ecstasy. "Samayamide", a `jaavali' in `Mayamalavagoula' and a `thillana' in `Khamas' constituted the enticing tailpiece.Akashvani staffer N.C. Madhav on violin, the vocalist's sister Nagalakshmi, a reputed artiste of the entire South on mridangam and the young Y.P.S. Madhubabu on ghatam lending excellent support appeared peers to the main artiste in all aspects and sustained the gusto with fine finesse.A. RAMALINGA SASTRYBottom Template Starts
