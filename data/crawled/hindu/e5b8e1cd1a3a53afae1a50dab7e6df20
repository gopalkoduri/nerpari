VMysore-based Vani Satish performed a vocal recital for Visakha Music and Dance Academy at its auditorium Kalabharathi last Sunday.A part of a family of scholarly exponents of Carnatic music and an A-grade vocalist and composer-cum-singer, Vani sang with finesse. Starting with the Hamsadhwani varnamJalajakshi, she rendered the Puliar Doraiswamy compositionSaraseeruhasanapriye(Naata)of Puliar Doraiswamy, her uncle and guru Bellari M. Seshagiri Acharya&#8217;s composition in Manoranjani,Tribhuvanajanani, establishing a happy rapport with all alike in the auditorium.Vani also elaborately sangVararagalayagnuluof Thyagaraja (Chenchukambhoji) in fast tempo before she rendered the alapana of Keeravani in detail. She  expanded onKaligiyuntegadaof Thyagaraja with fine neravu and swaram in the two tempos. Her expression of manodharma  was well-planned and executed with appeal. Her husband Mysore Satish on the violin not only followed tunefully but also exhibited exquisite spontaneity. B.V.S. Prasad on the mridangam  admirably supported the layabhava, ably assisted by K.V. Ramakrishna on the ghatam.Vani&#8217;s finale consisted ofAlarulukuriyagain Sankarabharanam, and Purandharadasa&#8217;s in Ragamalika piece in Bhageswari, Mohana and Subhapantuvarali.
