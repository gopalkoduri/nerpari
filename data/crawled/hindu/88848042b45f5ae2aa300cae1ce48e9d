VB. RamadeviAs the smoothly flowing violin blended with the dancing melody of the sitar and the tabla capered along with the mridangam and the kanjira, the differences between the north and the south dissolved and as a result, Nani Palkhiwala Hall, Coimbatore, was flooded with reverberating music.Rajalakshmi Fine Arts had arranged for the instrumental jugalbandi featuring violin by Kalpana Venkat and sitar by B. Sivaramakrishna Rao.Complete masteryKalpana, a disciple of T. Rukmini, exhibited complete mastery over her chosen instrument while Sivaramakrishna Rao, disciple of Guru Ahamad Khan Husseni, exuded confidence. They began with a varnam in Hindolam, ``Mriganayani'' composed by P. Sashidhar. ``Giriraja Sutha Thanaya'' in Bangala by Tyagaraja sprinted through delightfully.After the lively ``Sobillu Sapthaswara'' in Jaganmohini by Tyagaraja, they presented ``Entharo Mahanubhavulu'' the Sree Raga panchratnam, in its serene beauty. The main item was a Ragam Tanam Pallavi in Sarasangi, known as Nat Bhairav in Hindustani. What started as a mild breeze of melody slowly gained in speed and force and became a powerful tornado with the passage of time.The fact was that most of those present were not conversant with Hindustani music. But that did not seem to matter. They were happy to be deliciously drenched in the unique music that filled the hall.The devout Tulsidas bhajan, ``Sri Ramachandra Krupaalu'' in Yamuna Kalyani was unhurried and peaceful. The Saibhajan, ``Viswaadhaari'' in Poorvi Kalyani was melodious. The incredibly fast tillana by Balamuralikrishna in Brindavani helped in maintaining the spirit till the end.The rhythmic feast came to an end with Badrachala Ramadas's mangalam, ``Ramachandraya''. During the tani avartanam, D. A. Srinivas on the mridangam, B. S. Purushottam on the kanjira and Chandrajith on the tabla, outdid themselves and one another. The thrill of meeting the challenge successfully was infectious and the audience got high-class entertainment.Bottom Template Starts
