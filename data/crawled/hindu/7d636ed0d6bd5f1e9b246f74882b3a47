VShreya Devnath exuded warmth and confidence as she played for the senior citizens at the Sowndaryam Comfort Home, Coimbatore. Dressed in a simple sari and adorned with a sweet smile, Shreya was a picture of poise and elegance.She opened the concert with a varnam in Nalinakanthi and concluded with a thillana in Durga -- both compositions of her guru, Lalgudi Jayaraman. Her repertoire was soaked in devotion and she presented them with total involvement.Intense sessionsPeriasamy Thooran's &#8216;Thaaye Tripurasundari' in Suddhasaveri and Subbaraya Sastri's &#8216;Janani Ninnu Vina' in Ritigowla were presented with intensity. Before proceeding with &#8216;Nee Irangaayenil Pugaledhu' by Papanasam Sivan in Atana, she demonstrated how the same words conveyed different emotions according to the sangatis.The first sangati is just a statement, the next is a question, the third a plea and the fourth, total submission. As she sang it, one had to agree with what she said.Shreya's delineation of Kalyani was leisurely and authentic. &#8216;Kamalaambaam Bhajare' by Dikshitar showcased her strict adherence to patanthara. Her fertile imagination and grasp over layam were brought to the fore during the swaraprastaras.The lighter session comprised &#8216;Sri Jagadeeswari Durga', &#8216;Vellai Thaamarippoovil' and &#8216;Karpagame Kadaikkan Paaraai.'The composer's wonder and admiration at Yashoda's good fortune were brought out beautifully in the innumerable ways in which the lines &#8216;Ammaa Endrazhaikka' were played for the kriti &#8216;Enna Thavam Seithanai.'Vadasithur Ramachandran on the mridangam and K. Jagannathan on the morsing gave her able support.
