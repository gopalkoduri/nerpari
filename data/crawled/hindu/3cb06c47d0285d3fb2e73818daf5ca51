VBrindavan Audio - CDM. Chandrasekharan Carnatic Classical - violin - Rs.150.Sangita Kalanidhi M. Chandrasekharan is a remarkable musician who has fought against many odds with ceaseless grit and courage through the years to establish himself as one of the fore rankers in the discipline of Carnatic music as a violinist, vocalist, guru and so on.The album titled, `Panchadasa Ragas' is an interesting, imaginative attempt to highlight the salient features of 15 melodies.Beginning with a brief Nattai, the vidwan presents both oral and instrumental expression to Narayani, Sunadhavinodini, Rasaali, Guntakriya, Devamruthavarshini, Revagupti, Shuddhsarang, Nayaki, Natabhairavi, Balahamsa, Madhukauns, Brindavana Saranga, Brindavani, Misrakhamas and Sindhubairavi.The agenda is a pleasant combination of Carnatic and Hindustani ragas. The parent scale for every raga is mentioned as also the ascending and descending format.The other aspects of each raga such as vakra, varja and jeeva swaras are brought into clear focus in the singing and in the violin version.Some of the popular songs in these ragas by Tyagaraja, Swati Tirunal, Papanasam Sivan, Mysore Sadasiva Rao, Muthuswami Dikshitar and Periyasami Thooran are cited as examples.The concept and compilation are credited to Tiruvidaimarudur Radhakrishnan.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
