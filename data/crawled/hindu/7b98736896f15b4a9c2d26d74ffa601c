VKalavardhanisCarnatic classical vocal - Panthula Rama - Price Rs. 120CD Rec 427Panthula Rama, Andhra based vocalist, has found much favour with the Chennai rasikas for her dignified, mature concert presentations. Her opening song in the album is "Paripalayamam" in Reetigowlai, a Swati Tirunal kriti that attained a special stature because of the soulful interpretation by the inimitable M.D.Ramanathan. Rama's version eschews the superfluous, retaining the melody and the emotional substance.The Varali raga is beautifully portrayed and developed in the manner of a pyramid. M.S.N.Murthy on the violin responds to the vocalist's alapana with a measured grace that has quality befitting a commendable standard.Captivating auraThe Narayani kriti of Tyagaraja "Rama Neevegani" brings vivid memories of G.N.Balasubramaniam's mercurial rendition that inspired so many of the younger generation to learn it and include it in their concerts.Rama does well to capture the mood of the song and present it convincingly. The swara passages reflect a praiseworthy level of musical and grammatical awareness. "Mariyadagadu" of Tyagaraja was sensitively etched, while the impromptu solfa chains free from excessive calculations and pyrotechnics, have a captivating aura.The avartanam on the mridangam by J. Vaidyanathan, though brief, was of emphatic quality. Alathoor Vijayakumar's "Navarathna Bhushita" in Navaratna Vilasam, Tharangambadi Panchanadayyar colourful multi-raga Ragamalika and Tyagaraja's "Sri Rama Rama" in Neelambari round off the agenda in a worthy fashion.S.
