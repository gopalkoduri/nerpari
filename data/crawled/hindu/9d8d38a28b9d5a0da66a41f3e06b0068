VC. SURESH KUMARThe younger generation of classical artistes stole the show on the second day of the 33rd Pt. Motiram and Pt. Maniram Sangeet Samaroh, conducted by Sangeet Marthand Pandit Jasraj along with the Department of Cultural Affairs and Nizam College.Through their performances, they showed that classical music tradition, be it Hindustani or Carnatic, is here to stay and flourish. The evening started with an invocation song by Parimita Deshmuk, disciple of Pt. Jasraj. The rendering was very amateurish and went off key many a time.A small meeting, wherein the Secretary of Cultural Affairs, V. Nagi Reddy, was the chief guest, followed the invocation. Pt. Jasraj thanked the Department of Cultural Affairs for the support given to conduct this event year after year at Hyderabad. The first concert of the day was Hindustani vocal by Pt. Shaunak Abhisheki, son of the well-known Hindustani maestro, Jitendra Abhisheki. He started the concert withYeri mayi piya na ave, a composition inShudh Kalyanset toteen tal. Though the rendering ofVilambitwas not that impressive, he covered it up inDrutby rendering abandish,Nind na Avat, in style. Thetaranainteen talwas also good.The highlight of the concert was theHindola Ragand theRaga Malikapresented by him that reminded of his late father Jitendra Abhisheki. TheRaga Malikahad 17 ragas and he moved to one raga after other with ease. Pt Jasraj came on to the dais and complimented him for his excellent rendering of the composition.Kedar Pandit on the Tabla and Mukund Petkar on the harmonium supported him. Samarth and Sathrush were on thetanpuras. The second concert of the evening was ajugalbandiby flautist Shashank and Puryavan Chaterjee on the sitar. Both are very young and talented artistes and the Hyderabad audience had a feast of wonderful music.They started their concert withRag Bhoopalof Hindustani andRag Mohanain Carnatic set toRupakandMisra Chap Taalin respective styles. The two artistes showed how both the Carnatic and Hindustani forms could be blended in a very harmonious way by their performance. Both of them showed total control on their instruments. At times the rendering was very aggressive in nature but they had to blend it with some gimmicks to sustain the tempo and mood of the audience.TheTani Avartan(separate percussion time) was another highlight of the concert with both the accompanists V.V. Ramanamurthy on mridangam and Satyajeet on tabla showing their skills and mastery on their instruments. On the whole, it was a clear indication of the younger generation keeping the classical tradition alive. The credit goes to Pt. Jasraj for choosing and encouraging such talented youngsters to perform.Bottom Template Starts
