VArties Event Management\u000asounds a somewhat\u000amisleading\u000aappellation for this\u000agroup of enthusiastic young\u000aFrench musicians, but was\u000achosen to reflect the diverse\u000abackgrounds of its originators\u000a- cellist Gauthier Herrmann,\u000aand non-musician\u000aMorgan Segui, specialist in\u000aindustrial creation and\u000amass media.Their Festival concert,\u000aheld in collaboration with\u000athe International Music &\u000aArts Society on March 24,\u000awas unabashedly appealing,\u000aas Arties aimed to provide a\u000a"tres bonne soir‚e".The mainly Romantic\u000aprogramme contained some\u000aof the most mellifluous in\u000achamber music repertoire\u000aand therefore proved immensely\u000apopular.Unfortunately, the venue\u000a- the NIAS auditorium -\u000aproved a navigator's nightmare\u000aand this reviewer arrived\u000a- along with 6 others -\u000ahalf an hour late, thereby\u000amissing the first item, Poulenc's\u000aFlute Sonata.Brahms' Horn, violin and\u000apiano trio opus 40 was already\u000aunder way. This work,\u000awritten after his mother's\u000adeath, resonates with nostalgia\u000aand elegy.The horn is not usually\u000apart of a touring chamber\u000agroup, but getting audiences\u000ato hear as many different\u000ainstruments as possible, is\u000apart of Arties' intention to\u000a"create and organise exceptional\u000acultural events". As in\u000amost modern performances,\u000athe French horn replaced\u000athe original\u000aWaldhorn.The horn is normally evocative\u000aof clarion calls or\u000arousing one to the hunt, so it\u000ais Brahms' remarkable\u000aachievement that he expressed\u000asome of his most\u000aimpassioned and heartfelt\u000amusic via this instrument,\u000aand credit to Benoit de Barsony\u000afor doing it justice. Sullimann\u000aAltmayer on the\u000aviolin was incisive, yet expressive.The clarinet and bassoon\u000aare also rarely heard on\u000aBangalore platforms, so\u000aGlinka's Trio Path‚tique\u000awas yet another relatively\u000a"new experience" provided\u000aby Arties. Glinka is generally\u000aconsidered the founder of\u000aRussian nationalism in music,\u000abeing the first to use his\u000acountry's folk melodies, expressed\u000ain this work in the\u000aidiom of Viennese classicism.The "long-breathing"\u000apassages in the Scherzo\u000awere well managed by Olivier\u000aPatey on clarinet and\u000aLionel Bord on bassoon,\u000atheir mellow woodwinds\u000alyrical against Romain Descharmes'\u000ascintillating passages\u000aon the piano. Running\u000atriplets brought the finale to\u000aan exciting close.The choice of Dvorak's\u000aPiano Quintet Opus 81 was\u000aagain an attractive one, acknowledged\u000aas one of the\u000athree masterpieces in the\u000aform, along with Schumann's\u000aand Brahms'. The\u000aquiet opening bars presented\u000athe lyrical cello theme\u000aover piano accompaniment\u000aand cellist Gauthier Hermann\u000awas equal to the task\u000aof conveying what is arguably\u000aone of most seductive\u000aauditory experiences. The\u000apiano in the Dumka offered\u000aa melancholy theme, but\u000asoon alternated between\u000afast happy interludes and\u000apassages of contemplative\u000aexpressiveness, with Altmayer\u000aand Joseph Andre on\u000aviolins and Nicolas Bone on\u000aviola.The programme was\u000athoughtfully chosen to\u000ashowcase each instrument's\u000aattributes and the performers\u000aplayed with group empathy,\u000aperfectly capturing\u000athe warmth and intimacy of\u000achamber music. That they\u000alove playing was unreservedly\u000amanifest in their facial\u000aexpressions and body language.\u000aTheir evident enjoyment\u000awas therefore\u000ainfectious, particularly in\u000athe encore: a lively medley\u000aof tunes, both classical and\u000apopular, rendered in a raucous\u000ainformal style.
