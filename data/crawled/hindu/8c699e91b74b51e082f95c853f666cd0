VTadepalli Lokanadha Sarma rendered recitals of compositions of Annamayya in the Vaggeyakara festival organised by Andhra Music Academy in Kalabharathi on the July 15 and then of Bhadrachala Ramadas in Sankara Matham for Sri Vijaya Thyagaraja Sangeetha Sabha two days later.Like his guru, Chittoor Subrahmanyam Pillai, he proved to be a name to reckon with.Singing the compositions of Annamayya in Naata, Bowli and Lalitha, Charukesi Sindhubhairavi and so on, he expounded pietistic attribute of the composer. Kokkonda Subrahmanya Sarma on violin and Mandapaka Nagalakshmi on mridangam provided good support. Rendering keertans of Bhadrachala Ramadas with similar involvement, Sarma cast an ecstatic spell.His choice comprised a sensible mix of traditionally handed down and his own tunes set in Naata, Purvikalyani, Abhogi, Naadanamakriya, Subhapantuvarali and an enthralling rendering of a poem of four stanzas in Raagamalika (Shanmukhapriya, Sahana, Mohana and Surati).G. Annajirao on violin and G. Venkatarao on mridangam lent excellent support.
