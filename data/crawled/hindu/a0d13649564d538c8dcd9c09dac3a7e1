VDesi RappersBIG Music, Rs.150Hip-hop and rap don&#8217;t really suit Indian voices unless the lyrics have a desi touch to them and the music an earthy, folk feel. And therefore United Desis&#8217; debut album &#8220;Desi Game&#8221; might just do well in India. This album by BIG\u000a Music has fifteen fusion tracks with Punjabi, Hindi and English lyrics. The band comprises Mumbai-based rappers &#8211;Ques?ion and Graffiti Culprit. Also associated with United Desis is RSC or Rabbit Sack, who provided the pristine beats to the music, and produced the album as well. &#8220;Lemme be the one&#8221; is one song that is both groovy and smooth, and reminds one of the B21&#8217;s style of music. Another good song is &#8220;Desi&#8221;, which begins on a slow note and the earthy music has an appealing, soft tone throughout. &#8220;Main hoon tumhari Ft. RSC, Eva&#8221; is a hip, bouncy number. The deep female voice repeating &#8216;Main hoon tumhari&#8217; really compliments the song by giving an Indian feel to it, and one can&#8217;t help but think of Raghav&#8217;s popular fusion music. Then there is &#8220;Ques?ion&#8217;s Interview (Skit)&#8221;, which is like a monologue that boasts of Mumbai city as the &#8216;New West Coast&#8217;. Another funky song is &#8220;One Vision&#8221;. Its Punjabi and English lyrics fuse well and the bubbly beats make the track really enjoyable. If something like soulful existed in hip-hop/rap genre, then this number sure would have been one. &#8220;Sohniye&#8221; is an instantly likeable song. One track to which you may either do bhangra or rap or both is &#8220;Your eyes Ft. Kacy&#8221;. This song is worth listening and dancing to. &#8220;This is how we&#8221;, with its well-handled loops and beats is great to listen to.
