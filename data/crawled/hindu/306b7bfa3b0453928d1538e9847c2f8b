VT.R.Mahalingam (Mali), Karukuruchi P. ArunachalamTwin CDs &#8211; Rs. 250;CD - Rs. 125.The first CD starts with a Navaragamalika varnam of Patnam Subramania Iyer. A very casual  playing like the left-hander&#8217;s stylish square cut in cricket.Next comes &#8216;Nijamarmamulanu&#8217; (Umabaranam-Adi-Tyagaraja). Mali resorting to  mandhara stayi, time and again, is very soothing to the ears.The &#8216;Chinnanadena&#8217; piece (Kalanidhi-Adi-Tyagaraja) often heard those days  on AIR, presented in this CD is refreshing. The Khamas delineation is haunting.With a few sancharas he sketches the raga&#8217;s picture and thereafter it is pure embellishment with meaningful simple phrases.You are in a trance by the time Sitapati is taken up at a very leisurely pace. &#8216;Vinata Suta&#8217; (Jayantasena-Adi-Tyagaraja) is still slower yet captivating.Though the sleeve says it is Ragam-Thanam-Pallavi in Sahana, only the tanam and pallavi are  featured, followed by ragamalika swaras in Saveri, Ahiri, Saranga, Nilambari that are just mesmerising.The second CD features Kalyani extensively (wrongly printed in the sleeve as Simendhramadhyamam).Karukuruchi P.Arunachalam&#8217;s nagaswaram is featured in a single CD album. The moment  raga Gowla is played you are transported to the mada veedhi of a temple, wherein a procession of the presiding  deity  is in progress.It is said  Karukuruchiar was spotted by T.N.Rajaratnam Pillai in one such temple procession wherein Arunachalam was part of a Urumi Melam group.The rest is history. After &#8216;Balakanakamaya&#8217; (Atana-Adi-Tyagaraja) and &#8216;Sadhinchene&#8217; (Arabhi-Adi-Tyagaraja), a detailed and masterly Kalyani alapana is featured. &#8216;Etavunara&#8217; (Adi-Tyagaraja) is the kriti.&#8216;Sarajinabhasodhari&#8217; (Rupakam-Dikshitar) is a very emotional rendering. &#8216;Nenarunchinanu&#8217; (Malavi-Adi-Tyagaraja) wrongly printed in the sleeve as Nilmbari is racy.A collector&#8217;s item.
