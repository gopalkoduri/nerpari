VWhether it was the benign wisdom of ageing or maturity reflected in a true understanding of the life breath of music or the present status of his voice dictating the limits to his performing exuberance, the programme of Madurai T.N. Seshagopalan at Sri Krishna Gana Sabha had none of the flamboyant musical opulence of his early years.The exposition was comparatively earthy, ragas being sedate with few bravura sancharas. Still sahitya clarity was far from his attention. Intuition, instinct and aesthetic orientation of the day's concert brought to the surface the truth that these, not unregulated vocalised profligacy, provided the consecrated principles of good music. The day's music had all the ingredients of classicism compressing glorious shades in remarkable brevity.But, a significant &#8216;but' at that, was his unwieldy, inelegant Dwijavanti raga alapana and kirtana, &#8216;Cheta Sri Balakrishnam.' The jugalbandi mode of vinyasa at a weary length was carried on with optimum fuss blurring the ragas' distinguishing graces. It was demonstrative exhibitionism of his prowess rather than the elusive, fragile beauty of the raga. The violinist, M. Chandrasekharan's solo versions contained more genuine Dwijavanti.As regards the song, the constant reference to the sheet of paper was enough to suggest insufficient preparation. The interpretation drained the raga of all the tantalising charm that Dikshitar has built into its structure.Pantuvarali (&#8216;Sarasaaksha Paripaalaya') and Thodi (&#8216;Thaaye Yasoda') were the two familiar ragas he took up for elaboration with pertinent sancharas finely balanced, delightful in direction and accuracy. Seshagopalan's astonishing ability to visualise unexplored facets in arresting images was in stark contrast to his Dwijavanti.Chandrasekharan, an artist of high standing, displayed grit and firmness of purpose making his intention clear of playing nothing but passages of excellence. Surprisingly Guruvayoor Dorai presented the other side of his talent, as a mridangam player of gentle percussive disposition.
