VAssociation for Carnatic Music (ACM), Tirupati, strives to propagate Carnatic music. The association conducts monthly concerts to provide a platform for artistes, especially amateurs, to prove their mettle.An upcoming flautist J.B. Sruthi Sagar, a disciple of S.Sunder, gave a performance at the mini-hall of the Mahati auditorium recently. The final year mechanical engineering student, whose initial tutelage was under B.V. Balasai, has already won the title &#8216;Kuzhal Isai Selvan&#8217; from Raja Muthaiah Mandram, Chennai and won accolades for best performance from Krishna Gana Sabha during the Gokulashtami 2009 series. He is a B-grade artist with All India Radio and won the first prize in 2005.The event achieved its synergic effect due to the effective accompaniment provided by the violinist R. Rahul, who started learning from Vasantha Kannan, Calcutta, at the age of six.ACM celebrated its first anniversary recently by conducting state-wide junior and senior level competitions. The special feature is that the winning artist will get that particular instrument as the prize.
