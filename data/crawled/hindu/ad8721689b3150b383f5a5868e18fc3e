VHe opened his concert in Thrissur with the much sought-after Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Enduku nirddaya,&#8217; in Harikamboji. The madyama-kala composition appeared the right choice to create the  ambience for the concert. Moreover, his soothing rendition evoked a  mood of serenity.Invigorating was the Dhenuka number set to Adi tala, &#8216;Theliyaleru Rama,&#8217; also by Tyagaraja, which included  delectable sangatis. Protracted swaraprasthara  was the hallmark of the musician whose other numbers also had an equal share of this feature.The ability of the musician to dissect a raga and highlight  its alluring phrases was evident in &#8216;Padmavati ramanam,&#8217;   an Oothukadu Venkita Kavi composition in Poorvikalyani, set to misra chappu.  &#8216;Ediyochalanu,&#8217; a  Tyagaraja composition in  Keeravani set to Adi tala, was in a fast tempo and provided a fitting contrast to the earlier pieces.The singer&#8217;s preference for  Tyagaraja&#8217;s  compositions was evident in the concert.  During the concert, the vocalist paid a rich tribute to the saint composer through a short speech.  He pointed out that there were 32 compositions in Sankarabharanam itself and all of them were significant in his repertoire. He followed it with &#8216;Eddudanilapithe needu sommu&#8217; in the same raga.O.S. received  commendable support from T.H. Subramaniam (violin) and Petri Sathishkumar (mridangam). The  melodic phrases woven by Subramaniam  were specially noteworthy. Sathishkumar exhibited how the mridangam could complement a  vocal rendition and also  the tani avartanam.The demarcating feature of Trichy Ganeshan&#8217;s concert, on the second day, was his accent on  creativity that was discernible from the first number, &#8216;Pavanathmaja gacha paripoorna swatcha,&#8217; a Dikshitar composition in Natta, set to Jampa tala. His sancharas in all the numbers were unusually long and aesthetic.Some of the rare ragas he tried included Jayamanohari (&#8216;Sree ramyachithalamkrita swaroopa&#8217;)  and Balahamsa (&#8216;Evarunnaarunnu brocheva&#8217;).The couple of Tamil compositions in between were also new to the listeners. &#8216;Ramanukku mannan,&#8217; composed by Arunachala Kaviyar in Adi tala, had  an alapana that highlighted the  captivating shades of Hindolam. But he anchored his rendition on an undue emphasis on &#8216;kanakku&#8217; (calculations) that appeared counterproductive to the melodic structure of the composition.  The major raga of the concert was Shanmughapriya for which he sang the  Dikshitar composition &#8216;Ekamresa nayakim iswrarim&#8217; in Adi tala.Ganeshan was accompanied by R. Swaminathan on the violin, N. Hari on the mridangam and Kovai Suresh on the ghatom.The two-day programme was organised by Srutibharati Academy of Fine Arts, Thrissur, in connection with the decennial celebrations of the institution.  Cultural programmes were presented by students of the institution as well.
