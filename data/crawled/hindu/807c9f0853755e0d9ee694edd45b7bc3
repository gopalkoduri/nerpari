VGiridharan began with Balamuralikrishna&#8217;s varnam, &#8216;Omkaara Pranava&#8217; in Shanmukhapriya. His way of presenting the sahitya, splitting them  clearly and correctly at the right places was praiseworthy. He sang &#8216;Teliyareru Ramabhakthi Margamu&#8217; in Dhenuka.Singers usually split it as &#8216;Teliyareru Rama&#8217; and &#8216;Bhakthi Margamu.&#8217; He sang &#8216;Ramabhakthi&#8217; together and that made good sense.The kriti, &#8216;Eadaari Sancharinturaa&#8217; in Sruthiranjani was immensely moving as the sahitya was presented meaningfully giving due respect and weightage to the frustration of Tyagaraja who is not able to decide whether he should adhere to the path of &#8216;Advaita&#8217; or &#8216;Dvaitha&#8217;.&#8216;Raminchuvareverura&#8217; in Subhoshani was pleasant with its swaying rhythm. He delineated Kamavardhini (&#8216;Shambho Mahadevaa&#8217;), Rasikapriya, (&#8216;Pavana Thanaya&#8217;-Balamurali) and Sankarabharanam (&#8216;Rama Ninnuvina&#8217;) beautifully and the swaraprastharas were lively and different. He cut short his kalpanaswaras suddenly while singing the Sankarabharanam kriti and let the percussionists take over (perhaps to conclude his concert in time).Coimbatore R. Jayaprakash (mridangam), Coimbatore G. Suresh (ghatam), Alathur T. Rajaganesh (kanjira) and Palani K.V.Arumugam (morsing) formed a strong team and presented an absorbing thani.Coimbatore S. Usha&#8217;s violin showed great maturity and sensitivity.She could be clear and subtle at the same time. Her depiction of the ragas and kalpanaswaras earned louder applause from the audience.Giridharan is blessed with a good voice that travels three octaves, and has been diligently training his voice under the guidance of various gurus (his mother Vanaja Raghavan, Thiruvengadu Jayaraman and now M. Balamuralikrishna). But it escapes one&#8217;s comprehension as to why he should consciously try to present every phrase like his latest guru. A certain amount of influence cannot be helped, and will in fact, enhance the effect of his music, if used occasionally. One need not try to be like the inimitable Balamuralikrishna. By trying to be just like him, Giridharan forced the audience to notice in which areas he was failing.It is sad that so much talent and hard work should be dedicated to imitate a great singer.
