VAmongst the youngsters who performed in the annual Tyagaraja Music Festival, organised in the Capital recently by Sree Shanmukhanda Sangeetha Sabha, Maharajapuram Ganesh Viswanathan put up an impressive performance. Whether it was the rendition of th\u000ae compositions or the manodharma aspects (raga alapana, neraval and swaraprastaras), Ganesh&#8217;s calibre came to the fore during his recital spanning close to two hours.Ganesh not only handled Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Dachuko valena&#8217; in raga Todi as well as Patnam Subramanya Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;Nijadasa varada&#8217; in raga Kalyani in a detailed manner, but had instilled considerable depth into them. Both these compositions were preceded with fine sketches of the ragas and were followed by neraval and swaraprastaras rich in creativity. Ganesh, the grandson of the late maestro Maharajapuram V. Santhanam and son of Maharajapuram Srinivasan, finished his concert with a fitting Arunagirinadar&#8217;s Thiruppugazhl &#8216;Madiyal Vithaganagi&#8217;.The young vocalist was ably assisted by Mullaivasal G. Chandramouli on the violin, Delhi&#8217;s K.N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam and H. Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam.In another concert of the festival, Gayatri Girish put up a spirited performance. Though she wasn&#8217;t in her fine fettle  and her voice did not quite cooperate in the initial phase of the concert to the extent that she would have desired, Gayatri&#8217;s vidwat did come to the fore during her long recital.She took up three compositions for detailed presentations, namely Dikshidar&#8217;s &#8216;Sree Madhurapuri&#8217; in raga Bilahari, Subbaraya Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Janani ninnuvina&#8217; in  raga Reetigowla and Tyagaraja&#8217;s, &#8216;Kaligiyunde&#8217; in  raga Keeravani. The elaborate sketches of these ragas were soothing  to the ears. Further improvisation for the first  two compositions was in the form of swaraprastaras and for the third, it was both neraval of a phrase and swaraprastaras. The fast tempo composition of Patnam Subramanya Iyer, &#8216;Ninnucheppa&#8217; in  raga Mandari that Gayatri presented in between kept the proceedings lively.VVS Murari on the violin took full advantage of the situation. His sketches of the ragas Bilahari and Keeravani too were delightful. Shertalai Ananthakrishnan&#8217;s understanding of the mridangam  added valuable support to the compositions  and his taniavartanam in Adi taal was captivating with a riveting kalaparamanam.The other artistes who performed in the series were the Carnatica brothers (K.N. Sashikiran and P. Ganesh) and K. Dharini, apart from a brief inaugural nadaswaram session by Palayur Brothers.By the way, it is heartening to note that a number of other organisations in the Capital too helda variety of programmes in memory of music composers, particularly the legendary Saint Tyagaraja. All these culminated in group singing of the saint&#8217;s Pancharatna kritis.These include a four-day celebration in Delhi&#8217;s Mayur Vihar Phase II, under the aegis of South Indian Sangam and Sri Ganesh Sewa Samaj, a day&#8217;s event in Vasundhara Enclave under the aegis of Vasundhara Enclave Sarveswara Samaj, and in neighbouring Noida by Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam Charitable Trust.
