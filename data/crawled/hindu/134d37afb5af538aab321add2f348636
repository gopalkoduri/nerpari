VShrikari is a std VIII student. As a little girl, she was interested in Bharatanatyam as well as classical music. &#8216;Uttaraa&#8217; a centre for performing arts provided her the opportunity of learning them under one roof, Geetha Ganeshan teaching her Bharatanatyam and Jayaprada Ramamurthy teaching flute.After taking part in group shows, Shrikari has now grown into a flute soloist. The depth of her knowledge came to the fore during her performance at Thyagaraya Ganasabha. The experience she gathered in playing the wind instrument helped her in shaping the concert into an impressive presentation in the company of Pawan Singh on violin, Sai Giridhar on mridangam and Sridharacharya on ghatam.The concert sounded a different kind of experience. Shrikari opened traditionally with a Kambhojivarnamand carried forward the tempo into her invocation to VinayakaMaha Ganapathimin Nata of Muttuswamy Deekshitar. Thyagaraja&#8217;sSobhilluin Jaganmohini,Swagatham Krishnaof Oothukadu were played with care before she presented the mainragaLathangi forMarivereof Patnam Subramanya Iyer. She presented theraganeatly and theswarakalpanapart too was with ease keeping well to the rhythm of Kandachapu talam.  TheTani avartanamby percussionists followed.Her play ofVenkataachala Nilayamin Sindhu Bhairavi of Purandaradasa was followed by a pleasing tillana of Balamurali in Kadana Kutuhuhalam. She also added to her repertoire an Annamacharyakirtanaand Swami Dayananda Saraswathi&#8217;s composition on Lord Siva. The concert ended with a Kannada devotional of Purandaradasa in Madhyamavati and Ganapati Satchidananda Swami&#8217;s Mangalamset in Revati. The violinist and the percussionists lent support to this young girl of great promise.
