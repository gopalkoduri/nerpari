VThe ragamalika swaras that formed part of the RTP were strung with three pearls, Surya (which is roughly Hindolam that deploys Anthara Gandharam), Hamir-Kalyani and Manirangu and the ascent and descent procedures were executed with professional precision (a tribute to her guru the late Sulochana Pattabhiraman). Earlier &#8220;Vallabha Nayakasya&#8221; (Begada-Dikshitar), &#8220;Sivanandha KamaVardhanim&#8221; (Panthuvarali-GNB) - with a seasoned niraval at Bhavaanim Phaavanim Kamala - and &#8220;Adukaradhani&#8221; (Manoranjani-Tyagarajar) were neat and worthy presentations. The last of these especially fulfilled the requirements of sahithya bhavam in a self-assured manner.Dharini encountered some difficulty at the upper registers and the mandhara sthayi in spite of her sincere attempts to maintain her voice level. A mikeless concert once in a while would perhaps serve as a good feedback for her.K.P.Nandini on the violin lived up to her reputation and negotiated the pallavi with a good deal of confidence. Ethirajan on the mridangam provided laya support with restraint and gave a thani that was replete with attractive sollu combinations.
