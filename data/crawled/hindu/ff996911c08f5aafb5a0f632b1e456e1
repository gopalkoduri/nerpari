VAmong them,  Sachidananda Shivabhinava Nrisimhabharati Mahaswamigal has gifted numerous hymns including one on Sadasiva Brahmendra &#8212; the Sanskrit language flows with rare fervour in his compositions.Set to music by Shenkottai S.K.S. Harihara Subramanian, 11 stotras on Ganapati, Kartikeya, Parvati and Shiva have  been rendered mellifluously by the Sringeri Sisters, Sharada Ramanan, T. Srilakshmi and S. Bharati.Besides revealing the  glory of the cosmic manifestations, the CD should  help  aspirants learn the right pronunciation.It is available with the administrator, Sri Sharada Peetam, Sringeri - 577139, Ph: 08265 &#8211; 250123 and at Sringeri Shankara Math, 97, Ammamandapam Road, Srirangam, Tiruchi 620 006, Ph : 0431 - 2436343.The opening &#8216;Sri Ganadhipa Pancharatnam&#8217; was composed by the acharya to mark the start of the annual Ganapathy Vakyartha Sabha conducted by the Math where the pontiff  spends  Chathurmasya vrata.In this sadas, Vedic scholars present significant viewpoints for 12 days.The stotras also have some charming surprises.Ganapati is seated on a peacock mount in Gokarna but  prefers the shades of an Aswatha tree in Kaladi. Familiar phrases from earlier stotras are effortlessly woven into the texture of the new ones as in &#8216;Sri Devi Dhamashtakam.&#8217;&#8216;Sri Chandramowli Stotram&#8217; presents an acronym of Om-na-ma-si-va-ya.Often the acharya indicates local legends that mark the unfailing grace of God (&#8216;Sri Kantashtakam&#8217;; &#8216;Sri Kalantakashtakam&#8217;).Touching upon the significances of the Subramania concept in his stotra written in the bhujanga metre, the acharya underlines the Vedic concept that Subramania is always in the cave of the heart, the Agni within.The producers of the CD have thoughtfully provided an accompanying booklet containing the stotras in Devanagari and their English translation.Using several evocative and soft-textured ragas such as Kurinji, Poorvikalyani and Hamsanandi, the sisters have indeed begun well with this first album.We await the two other promised discs.
