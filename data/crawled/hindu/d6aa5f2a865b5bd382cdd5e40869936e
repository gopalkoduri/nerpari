VVenkatamukhi, the court musician of Tanjore king Vijaya Raghava in the 16th century is considered the original composer of 72 melakartha ragas.  Sukanya Vijaya Kumar claims that Carnatic music exponents use 15-20 Melakartha ragas to compose, perform and teach. This led the musician to bring out a CD of Rabindranath Tagore&#8217;s classical work &#8220;Gitanjali&#8221; having 18 songs using 72 Melakartha ragas. &#8220;Why is it that there is not a single female music composer/master in the history of Indian classical and western music? Why only &#8220;great masters&#8221; and not &#8220;great ladies&#8221;. These were the questions that have tormented me from my student days and encouraged me to do this experiment,&#8221; says Sukanya. She has also brought B.M. Shri&#8217;s English songs.
