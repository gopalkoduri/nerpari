VWithin a week the Bengaluru-based vocalist, blessed with a bold, mellifluous voice, regaled aficionados at the &#8216;Wednesday Recitals&#8217; &#8212; a venerated weekly event organised at ITC Sangeet Research Academy, and exposed another sphere of his work &#8212; a beautiful blend of two different styles of Pandits Mallikarjun Mansoor and Bhimsen Joshi.His Puria Dhanashri followed by Nat Malhar had the serene magnetism of Kirana&#8217;s characteristic &#8216;sur&#8217; and the thrill of Jaipur&#8217;s ornamental style. &#8216;Sur&#8217; denotes elongated notes, at times transcending rhythm or rhythmic patterns, to give a sense of tranquillity &#8212; the introspective melody throbbing with emotion. The Jaipur style on the other hand, combines elements from both Dhrupad and Khayal &#8212; giving equal importance to both sur and laya (tempo) and its variants. The whole process may be compared to a finely designed ornament studded with gems. The arrival at sam (the first and most important point of stress in a tala-cycle) becomes a thrilling event.The impact of the parallel flowing ragas Nat and Malhar and their confluence was more pronounced due to their striking raganga-based movements. Ragangas are turns of phrases revealing the raga&#8217;s character. While raga Nat sports Sa Re Ga (shuddha) Ma Pa and glides down to Re, Malhar&#8217;s signature is the oscillating Ga (komal), imploring Ma to descend down at Re before resting at Sa.Supported by son-disciple Onkarnath (vocal), Gopal Misra (tabla) and Jyoti Goho (harmonium), he presented two bhajans made immortal by his mentors.Dithi presented two young musicians with great promise at Birla Academy recently. Prattyush Banerjee&#8217;s sarod, experimented with both melody and technique. Even in the limited frame of Gavati, his aesthetically planned alap-jod-jhala displayed innovative variants and steered clear of repetition. The carefully built crescendo was tamed by a tihai only to pick up the gat (composition meant for instruments) set to medium-paced Rupak tala. Each phrase development closed with a different tihai, almost entreating the tabla of Ashish Pal to give a befitting reply, and it was complied with. The faster Teen tala gat did not merge into jhala, as is the usual practice, but closed with a tihai.His second choice was Maluha Kedar. The meend-laden majesty of the aochar (brief introduction) left a craving for more. A striking Teen tala gat paved the way for the jhala that held the serenity of an alap in its fold before heading for the climax. Earlier, vocalist Tushar Dutta delighted with his rendition of Bhupali and Bihag.
