VShri Thyagaraja Sangeetha Sabha had arranged Koviladi Kala&#8217;s concert at Krishnamurthipuram Ramamandira. H.M. Smitha, P.S. Shridhar (mridanga) and V.S. Ramesh accompanied the artiste.The artiste possesses a soft soothing voice, effortlessly spanning over the three sthayis; and having acquired a good control over the inflections, she maintains consistency and evenness at all levels. However, the timbre slightly muffles in the very lower octaves (could have avoided such movements), gaining melody as it reaches higher ones.Overall impression: all her presentations convincingly preserved the sanctity of the lyrics. Swathi Thirunal&#8217;s &#8220;Deva Deva Kalayami&#8221; (Mayamalavagoula) marked her scholarly competence and devotional inclinations. She maintained uniformity in mood throughout this presentation, carrying it through an elaborate alapana, emotive lyrics, an elevating neraval (at &#8220;Jaatarupa&#8221;) and complementary passages of swarakalpana. However, for a fresh listener, the clarity in pronunciations was not sufficient to facilitate clear comprehension of Sanskrit lyrics.Devotional aspects strengthened by proficiency and commitment allured the audience in &#8220;Nannu Vidachi&#8221; (Rithigoula - Thyagaraja). Most of the alapana passages finding interpretations in majestic vilambakala, judiciously interspersed with madhyama kaala, reached emotive climax in the tarasthayi. The pleasing mood transformed into a definite tone of submission when she recited the main body of the composition.Further, the way of addressing the Lord by different names Kodandarama, Pattabhirama, while improvising the swaras embellishing the essence of the lyrics, endorsed her timely sense of manodharma. &#8220;Marivere&#8221; of Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer (Lathangi) and &#8220;Baalagopala Palayashumam&#8221; of Dikshithar (Bhairavi) too reached the same standards as the above ones. Nevertheless, she could have avoided unfamiliar (to her) compositions like &#8220;Shri Saraswathim Bhagavathim&#8221; (Athana -Vasudevacharya) the lyrics of which she had to refer to her notes. Such references dampened the intonations, made undesirable inroads into her involvement and, as a sequel, diluted the general appeal.* * *Rajiv Taranath, noted Sarod player, had arranged three concerts in memory of his guru, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, under the joint- patronage of Nadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha. Mysore M. Nagaraj gave his violin concert to mark the occasion. Tumkur B. Ravishankar accompanied him on the mridanga. The artiste&#8217;s remarkable proficiency over the instrument displayed adroitness in developing the presentations. Purvikalyani (&#8220;Jnanamosagarada&#8221; - Thyagaraja) comprised an attractive expatiation embedded with subtle gamakas in different speeds. Within the short time allotted, the artiste was able to include a neraval (at the charana, &#8220;Paramatmudu Jivatmukudu&#8221;) followed by passages of swarakalpana.Raga-tana-pallavi in Kiravani conveyed more than what one could expect under such circumstances where the need  for brevity claimed its domain. Daatuswara prayogas, sukshma sancharas and jaarugamakas embellished the progressions. It was awe- inspiring to watch particular method of eliciting series of swaras in one sweep of the bow and the quickness in executing the movements by smartly bouncing the bow on the strings in the tana sections.He developed kalpanaswaras in Shahana, Valachi and Sindhubhairavi. A tani avarthana also fitted into the slot.
