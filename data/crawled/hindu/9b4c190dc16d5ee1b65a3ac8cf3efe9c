VYoung singer Shwetha Keshav is doubly blessed by having artistes as her father and mother in Lakshmikeshav and Veena Keshav. Lakshmikeshav is well-known as a music composer and singer. Earlier trained under M.S.Vidya, Shwetha has imbibed the nuances of Carnatic vocalism under her present Guru and a scholar-vocalist Dr. T.S. Sathyavathi. She is a promising representative of the emerging Carnatic music trend. A CD titledSapta Varnaof her singing was released by veteran vocalist R. K. Srikantan at the Ananya auditorium. The veteran was in praise of the young singer's style and content of presentation. The formal function was followed by a short vocal recital by Shwetha Keshav to the accompaniment of Nalina Mohan (violin) and Mysore Radhesh (mridanga).The Hamsadhwani varna ("Pagavari") is beautified by kaala and gathi bedhas. The krithi on Ganesha in Saveri raga, the detailed delineation of Begade raga ("Neevera naa kuladhanamu") are notable for her hard work. As part of the revival of the Hindustani Sangeetha Kalakara Mandali a pleasant flute recital by K. Shakthidhar was held at the Gokhale Institute of Public Affairs, N.R. Colony.Appropriately supported by Gurumurthy Vaidya on the tabla, the youthful flautist mesmerised the audience with his melodic strains on the flute. The ebb and flow of the melody was consistent and full of impact. Yaman which resembles Kalyani of Carnatic music was explored to the fullest extent. He held the vaadi (gaandhar) and samvaadi (nishadha) in the requisite measure. In it one could enjoy the confluence of beauty of the raga, artistry and bhaava. The Pahadi dhun fell pleasantly on the ears. He passed around the grandeur of the raga in a systematic manner. As per the tradition, he concluded with Bhairavi.M. SURYA PRASADBottom Template Starts
