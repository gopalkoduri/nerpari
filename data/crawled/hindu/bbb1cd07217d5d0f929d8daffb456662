VDevotionals on KrishnaK. J. YesudasSagar 6 SM-CYPrice Rs.50 each (cassettes)K. J. Yesudas's  two albums for Sagar Music sung with genuine devotional involvement, reflect his intense zeal and passion for the art form of Carnatic music, and his love for the deities in the Hindu pantheon.The volume, `Krishna Nee Begane' begins with an energetic alapana of Hamsadhwani as a prelude to Purandaradasa's `Gajavadana Beduve' that is embellished with agile sarvalaghu swaras in the pallavi, and crowned with a tisra korvai,a laChembai Vaidyanatha Bagavathar, Yesudas's mentor. `Tirupati Venkataramana,' another Purandaradasa composition rendered with enthusiastic vigour, and `Kotta Bhagyave' in Shanmukhapriya by Vidya Prasanna Theertha in the same mould, sharpen the ambience.Suddha Saveri is described in detail but it comes  as a bolt from the blue when the violinist Mahadeva Sarma plays a crystal clear Madhyamavati both in his accompanying phrases and in his solo effort &#151;  quite unpardonable.The vocalist repeats the alapana for the violinist to get a feel of Suddha Saveri.The song that follows is  `Nalidade' on Devi Sharada by Sri Ranga Vittala.Purandaradasa's `Sriranjani song, `Srinivasa Enna Bittu' with characteristic sarvalaghu swara passages and a kuraippu that travels a fair distance from the Anumandra sthayi to the Adhi thara sthayi, elicits a round of resounding applause.Soothing bhajansThe second programme titled, `Swagatham Krishna' is introduced with a very pleasing composition in Mohanam by Uthukkadu Venkatakavi.The Suddha Saveri kriti in the previous album with the violinist's major solecism is again included in this agenda. Editing should be done with utmost care and correctness.The lighter section comprising `Krishna Deewani,' `Krishna Karuna,' `Hey Ram' and `Harivarasanam' are soul-soothing bhajans.Yesudas's elaboration of Kalyani with rich classical substance shows that he has his priorities right when it comes to weighty classical music.The violinist reveals the beauty of the melody with apt phrases based on the raga swaroopa.The tanam with a high level of adrenalin flow, and the percussionists also joining the fray, is a spirited exercise.An imaginative, well-organised pallavi in Khanda Triputa talam with lyrics extolling Udupi  Krishna, replete with appealing neraval and swaras in two speeds, is a commendable professional display.V. Praveen, the mridangist, and T. Radhakrishnan on the ghatam with their solid accompanying support and a brief but pertinent tani avartanam, emerge with flying colours.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
