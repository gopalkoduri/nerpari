VAlliance Francaise presented the vocal concert of S andeep Narayanan this past Friday, at the Ragasudha Hall, Luz, Mylapore. Sandeep, after the varnam, proceeded straight to a sprightly &#8216;Vallabha Nayakasya' (Begada-Rupakam-Dikshitar).Gifted with a voice that is bright and clear he presented interesting kalpanaswaras for the kriti.Ever smiling seasoned youngster S. Varadajan (violin) proved a good foil when he repeated the end korvai verbatim that made the hall sit up. The alapana of Mohanam that came next was a coagulation of phrases in varying speeds with akaram playing a very dominant part.Racy KharaharapriyaThe song &#8216;Vara Manthralaya' composed by Venkata Vittala in Misra Chapu saw him sketch a niraval as though he was possessed by the Saint himself.Open throated singing does augur well for Carnatic music. But again one should realise that the music's texture is a judicious blend of thick and thin. Sandeep Narayanan's Kharaharapriya essay that followed a racy &#8216;Yaydari Sancherintura' (Sruthiranjani-Adi-Tyagaraja) was bereft of this.At times he went off key too. The painstaking effort was not impressive for these reasons.Varadarajan made up with a soothing elaboration. &#8216;Chakkani Raja' (Adi-Tyagaraja) saw him come off better in sruti. Veteran Srimushnam Raja Rao during the kriti phase used the toppi and created a damaru effect that gave the much needed reprieve to the audience.His melkala Chathusram in the thani were captivating.
