VWith her facile voice that contributed to her communicative skill, Lakshmi Rangarajan's concert at the Mylapore Fine Arts Club's Tyagaraja aradhana was marked by her unmistakeable perception of  and subtlety of the saint's kirtanas.For her, raga alapanas of Durbar,  Ranjani  and Thodi  were not just swara scale variations. The fluid expressions were concerned with bringing out the raga swaroopas and hence their appeal.Lakshmi Rangarajan moved away from  contemporary kutcheri culture.Her technique was based on solid endowments of vaak-suddham.  Two other songs, `Tolijenma' (Bilahari), `Sobillu Sapta Swara' (Jaganmogini)  invited rapt attention by their lilting presentation. Lakshmi Rangarajan had voice support from her daughter Subhiksha. Padma Shankar, the violinist, provided sampradaya support. Poongulam Subramaniam (mridangam) and Adambakkam Shankar (ghatam) played in harmony with the quiet nature of the vocalist's style.SVKBottom Template Starts
