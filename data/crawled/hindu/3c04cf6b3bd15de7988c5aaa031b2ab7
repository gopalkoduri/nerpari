VThe Music Lovers' Association in association with Thyagaraja Gana Sabha organised `Veena Jhari' in memory of late Vasa Krishnamurthy, a well known Veena Vidwan at the Kala Subbarao Vedika on June 10. Music Lovers' Association has been encouraging young talent in both Hindustani and Carnatic music. And it has been some time since the city hosted performances on veena, and to bring in upcoming as well as senior veena artistes on one stage is indeed a good effort on the part of the organisers. The second generation of disciples of Vasa Krishnamurhty presented a pleasing and melodious Carnatic classical music on veena. The performers aged between 15 and 40 did justice to their skill. Prutu excelled in playingVasudevayaniinKalyani raag. Two more youngsters who showed promise were Y.V. Sai Krishna and Nayanika. Vasantha Lakshmi showed her expertise in elaboratingraag Mohanaand followed it by a briefThanamandThyagaraja krithi,Bhavanutha.

Indira Mani, senior musician and music director, was the chief guest and spoke on the technical aspect of handling the Veena instrument. She also complimented the association for encouraging the young talent. Also present on the occasion was well known gurthu vadyam artiste of Chennai P. S.
