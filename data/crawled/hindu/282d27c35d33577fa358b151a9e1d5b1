VSangeethika, the music chat show on Doordarshan (Keralam), pays tribute to the inimitable Mohammed Rafi. This show, which brings together people from different walks of life and professions gifted with inherent talents, features Mohammed Azad and not\u000aed music director Jerry Amaldev.&#8216;Dil Ki Awaz Suno,&#8217; a 30-minute, five-episode special on Mohammed Rafi has some of his popular, not-so-popular and filmi ghazals sung by Azad. And providing interesting info on these songs is Jerry Amaldev, who had assisted Naushad in numerous films, notated some of Rafi&#8217;s immortal songs and even helped the singer during rehearsals.&#8220;Of the singers I have heard in Kerala,  I think Azad is one of the best when it comes to singing Mohammed Rafi&#8217;s songs. His voice, the feel he imparts, his pronunciation, everything is so special.  We felt that Azad, a hairstylist, fits perfectly into the concept of Sangeethika, which features talented people pursuing different professions,&#8221; says V.S. Geetha, programme executive, Doordarshan.Instead of the usual Mohammed Rafi songs, this programme focusses on some hits during its time, but rarely performed on stage. &#8220;We have picked 20 songs. They include  ones like &#8216;Is rang badalti duniya&#8230;&#8217; from the film &#8216;Rajkumar,&#8217; ghazals from films and some tough numbers like &#8216;Kal raat zindagi&#8230;&#8217; from &#8216;Paalki.&#8217;  It was a satisfying experience, singing the songs and listening to Jerry Sir explaining some of the fines points and narrating some of his experiences with the great singer,&#8221; says Azad.This  is  telecast every Saturday at 6.15 p.m, then at 10.30 p.m. and a repeat telecast on Sunday at 10.30 a.m.
