VThe Carnatic-Hindustani jugalbandi by the inimitable pair &#8212;Sriram Parasuram and Anoorada Sriram &#8212; was a musical delight in midsummer. As usual, it is difficult to distinguish who fared better of the two, be it the Hindustani or Carnatic &#8216;baani&#8217;. The beauty of duo&#8217;s recital is the impeccable intonation they adhere to for individual lyrics which is not generally the trend with most south Indian singers.TheEvari bhodhana vini&#8230;in chaste Telugu with extensiveswarakalpanaby Anoorada warmed up the two-and-half-hour concert paving way for a Bandish which takes the audience along the elaborateaakar taan, picked up alternately by the couple making it an exciting competition. The display of technique intaanrendered the emotive element of the lines,Hum garib thum dhaataa very poignant expression, rather mechanical. The same cannot be said of the Meera bhajan, which was the highlight of the evening. Sung in mellifluous tones, suffused with feeling that complimented the lyrical excellence of the song&#8230;Sawli soorat, mohini moorath..describing lord Krsna. The &#8216;vinyas&#8217; (technical innovation) weaved magic in the air drawing spontaneous applause from the audience.The interpretation of the nuances of each raga with its Hindustani counterpart and vice-versa by Sriram was welcome in as much as it served to enhance the audience&#8217;s knowledge of classical music styles. This is something our renowned musicians must take up instead of directly launching into a kriti of some rare raga leaving the audience guessing or giving up in desperation. After all the aim of every performing art is to reach the commoner more than the connoisseur!The vocalists&#8217; penchant to spread GNB&#8217;s compositions far and wide &#8212; since Anoorada belongs to the direct line of his shisya parampara &#8212; was evident in the choice of numbers in Amrithabehag (a combo of Amritavarshini and Behag) and Vallachi (alaKalavati) .Santatamu ninney korithini&#8230;Anoorada&#8217;s opening notes (alapana) scaled amazing heights. Her strength is the tenor of her voice which is marvellous at the base as it is at thetaara sthayias was evident with herneravalandsangathi.Thetaranais Kalyani and Yaman Kalyani, a popular piece of the duo, was short and sweet. Sriram comes across as a musician par excellence with Hindustani over which he displays full control. His style is infectious for it ignites his accompanists to deliver in full form. Satish Kumar on the mridangam was pronounced while Harjit Singh on the tabla and the famous Surendra Bharti on harmonium were subdued and melodic. Purushottam on the kanjira is a known expert and Bhaskar H. N. excelled on the violin.The musical event was the second-day treat of South Indian Cultural Association&#8217;s golden jubilee fest at Ravindra Bharati.
