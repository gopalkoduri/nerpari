VIn Bihaag &#8211; &#8220;Aiso man mohan chit chor&#8221; performed in vilambit &#8212; Prabha Atre reflected her good judgment for improvisations. After feeling the pulse of the audience, she accomplished a feat characteristic of the  practitioners of the Kirana gharana, where she took the entire scale in one continuous melodious wave.These lines, flowing through the three octaves were performed subtly and enduringly with midh and the gamaka in a single breath. And they achieved with incredible finis the thickness and thinness of her tonal quality at the crucial pressure points, thereby presenting the Kirana aura and sensibility.In &#8220;Nand kunwar ki chhavi nyari&#8221; in dhrut her perfect Kirana tans satisfied both the sense of structure and melodic expectations, embodying the distinct tantakari&#8211;ang, which has been derived from playing on the Bin.Belonging to the Gurukul tradition of Suresh Babu Mane and Hira Bai Badodekar, stalwarts of the Kirana school, Prabha Atre&#8217;s renditions were reminiscent of the gayaki of Hira Bai herself. In the narration of Kalavati in dhritik taal and in rendering the taraana in the same raga, one found  the &#8216;dance form&#8217; and Dadra in mishr mandu accommodated with spontaneity. The final Bhairavi rendered beautifully provided  a fitting end to the evening. Though the bandishes have limited importance in Kirana, the audience drank deep from the ocean of melody. &#8220;Tan man dhan tope waaroon&#8221; was sung with verve and vibrancy.Chetna Banawat provided excellent vocal support with restraint and commitment. Chaitanya Kunte on the harmonium, a disciple of Arvind Thatte, synchronised splendidly with Arvind Kumar Azad on the tabla. Azad is a disciple of Pt. Lalji Srivatsav and Pt. Krishan Maharaj of Benares.
