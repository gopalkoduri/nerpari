VAnantha Sowri Rajan is the eldest son of veteran vocalist and violinist Komanduri Seshadri. That explains his moorings and knowledge in the art of violin playing. He was featured in a concert organised by Nada Bharati in association with Samaja Sampradaya Sangeetha Niketan at its venue Kalyana Mantapam, Gaddi Annaram. The repertoire of the violinist was traditional and judiciously proportioned with a mix of compositions by various composers.The main piece of the concert was Shanmukha Priya for Vallinayaka of Harakesanallur Muthaiah Bhagavatar, not a frequently heard piece. The raga essay was mapped with some energetic phrases revealing the artiste's flair for beauty. He evolved the raga in all the possible octaves. The kriti part was presented well with sense for Sahitya Bhava. The swarakalpana was presented in raga chain. This number stood out as the best offering of his concert, as expected. Anantha had, in fact, presented most of the numbers with brief raga and swara structures, but for the Khamas number Brochevarevarura of Vasudevachar and Manasa Etulorthune in Malayamarutham. A Sama raga number Annapoorne displayed his urge to create the mood in his brief raga delineation.He heralded his recital with Saveri varnam, Sarasuda and moved to popular invocation Vatapi in Hamsadwani. He presented the raga and swarakalpana, displaying immense confidence. While presenting another popular number of Thyagaraja's, Ganamurthe in Ganamurti raga he presented with considerable level of balance.
