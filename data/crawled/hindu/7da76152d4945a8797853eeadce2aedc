VAn acquiescent sweet voice is an advantage. Kolkata Srividya steered through her concert quite comfortably because of this. She could scale the tara sthayi notes and mantra sthayi phrases with equal ease and confidence. Srividya&#8217;s Khamas essay \u000amoved on perfect passages extracting the raga&#8217;s appeal without being an overstatement. &#8216;Brocheva revarura&#8217; of Mysore Vasudevachar and the swara section in the end showed the vocalist&#8217;s astuteness in framing well aligned swaras. &#8216;Eesa pahimam&#8217; in Kalyani of Tyagaraja too enjoyed its share of swaras neatly fixed to the pallavi earlier to Khamas.Embarking on a Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi (Shanmukhapriya) in a less than two-hour concert is not a wise move.  Quick exercises in chatusrajathi Rupaka talam hardly conveyed anything significant. It sounded more like a hasty pedantic presentation than an internalised deliberation.True, Srividhya&#8217;s Shanmukhapriya alapana was notable with swirls, pauses and repose but only good enough to be a prelude to a kriti than to a Tanam and Pallavi. &#8216;Guhane guruparane sankara priyane arulvai dayavai&#8217; was the pallavi.Kolkata K. Mohan, being Srividhya&#8217;s sibling, led her in executing the pallavi and swaras in the chosen tala scaffold. A piece of advice to the artists; announcements on special features like RTP is a must; it would be better appreciated before or in the middle as a matter of educating the audience instead of allowing them to revel in guess work. L. Ramakrishnan was on the violin. He acquitted himself well with good grasp of the vocalist&#8217;s ventures and adventures.K. Mohan was a protective percussionist through out with gentle and firm touches. &#8216;Thottu thottu pesa varan&#8217; in Behag, &#8216;Kanja dalaya daskhi&#8217; of Dikshitar in Kamalamanohari and the concluding thillana in Pahadi were the other items in Srividhya&#8217;s concert.The programme was part of the Gokulashtami Series of Sri Krishna Gana Sabha.
