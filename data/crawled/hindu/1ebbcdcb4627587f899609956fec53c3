VTHE CULTURAL programme series `Nela Nela Vennela' instituted in every music college in the State by the Department of Culture, A.P., is gaining popularity. The ever-increasing crowd every month is ample proof for it.The `Vennala' programme this time, held in the G.V.R. Government College of Music and Dance, Vijayawada, on Gokaraju Laila Gangaraju Kala Vedika presented two differently interesting programmes - the first being a vocal concert by B.V. Durgabhavani, a staff artiste of Vijayawada Akashvani and the second programme, a thrilling `talavadya' concert conducted by `mridanga' `vidwan', M. Lakshminarayanaraju.Durgabhavani, incidentally, is also a reputed violinist. She started her vocal concert with a `varnam' composed by her guru Annavarapu Ramaswamy and followed it with `Paramapavana' in `Ranjani'. Bhavani elaborated `Ranjani' with great ease and with good command over the `ragabhava'. This was followed by a rare `kriti' `Raja Raja Poojithe' in a rarer raga `Putrika'.Then came the main item `Akshayalinga Vibho' in `Sankarabharanam'. Because of the time limit Durgabhavani made the main item a brief one, but her raga expansion and `swara kalpana' had good impact on the audience.Nandakumar of Guntur and S. Prasad gave her fine support on the violin and `mridangam' respectively. The concert came to a close with an Annamayya `keertana' `Lali Sri Krishnayya, in `Dwijavanthi'.The second programme of the evening titled `Swaralaya Vedika' amply justified itself providing a thrilling musical and rhythmic treat. Manda Anantakrishna of Hyderabad played the flute and Palaparthi Nageswara Rao played the violin. The rest were all percussion artistes. After each `keertana' there was fine rhythmic finish from M. Lakshminarayanaraju (mridangam), Kotipalli Ramesh (kanjira), M. Vijayakumar (ghatam), T. Lakshmishanker (morsing) and S. Sayi Giridhar (tabla). The `keertanas' that figured in `Swaralaya Vedika' were `Sobhillu' in `Jaganmohini' and `Nagumomu' in `Abheri'. The last item was `Nijagadhasa Yadunandane', an `ashtapadi' of Jayadeva.Lakshminarayanaraju deserved praise for conducting the programme with good synchronisation and efficiency. The principal of the Music College, Ayyagari Syamasunder introduced the artistes.P. SURYA RAOBottom Template Starts
