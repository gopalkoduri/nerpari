VIT WAS the niche that was replete with the `gaayakadharma' (vocal fervour) that marked the violin solo concert of Mutnuri Srinivasa Narasimhamurty in the serene precincts of Sadguru Sri Raamadootha Mandiram recently. His essaying  of Carnatic music  like  his guru,  reflected  soulful involvement of an erudite mind and aesthetic heart.His violin solo was featured by the management committee of the `mandiram' celebrating `Srilakshmi jayanthi' and `Madana Pournima' last week. Renowned `mridangam' veteran Mullapudi Sri Ramamurty along with his son Raja Lakshmana Rao  and young Vedula Srikiran, prime disciple of Mutnuri on the violin lent commendable support.Mutnuri started on a tunefully evocative note playing the `Mohanavarnam' and sustained  the gusto rendering `Sobhillusapataswara' (Jaganmohini), `Sadaachaleswaram' (Bhoopalam) adorned with `ragam' and `swaram', `Sujanajeevana' (Khamas) and `Bantureethikoluveeyavayya Rama' (Hamsanaadam) suffixed with scintillating `swarakalpana'. Then he  eruditely elaborated  `Neevallagunadoshamemi' (Kapi) followed by painting a picturesque canvas of `Raagasudhaarasa paanamujesi' (Andolika) before rendering an adept `raagam taanam pallavi' in `Kaalyani'. The support on the `mridangam' by Mullapudi as well as the `thani' replete with enticing traverses of `gathi' and `yathi' coupled with an equally good support by the youngsters Srikiran (violin) and Raja Lakshmana Rao contributed grandeur.A composition each of Annamayya and Ramadas constituted the tailpiece. Founder trustees of the temple, Ganti Narasimhamurthy and M. Ramachandram presented mementos to the artistes.A.R.S.Bottom Template Starts
