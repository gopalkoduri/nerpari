VLALITHAA KRISHNANChennai's rasikas run the risk of missing out on some truly scintillating music, if they let the opportunity of attending Latha Madhav's concert pass them by. Endowed with a quicksilver voice that streaks across octaves like greased lightning and a gutsy, head-on approach when it comes to tackling demanding ragas, this Hyderabad-based vocalist did commendable justice to her training under eminent gurus such as Calcutta S. Krishnamurthy, Suguna Purushottaman, M.S. Balasubramanya Sharma and P. L. Narasimha Rao.In her concert for the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, the accent was on Telugu compositions, a natural choice, considering the fact that they constituted home ground. The bhava and modulation in her enunciation of sahitya added depth to her interpretation of compositions.Charming portraitA brief raga sketch followed by Annamacharya's ``Vaade venkatadri" (Adi) and a few well-chosen rounds of swaraprasthara contributed to a charming portrait of Vasantha.Ambujam Krishna's Tamil composition ``Om Namo Narayana" in Karnaranjani was rendered with involvement. In the extensive Begada alapana, the artiste achieved that elusive winning blend of lakshana and lakshya as the raga dwelt on salient features without stinting on adventurous flights. If her natural tendency to end sancharas with a super-swift phrase could be tempered by slowing the latter down a tad, the prayogas would gain in precision and acquire added weight.The detailed neraval at ``Kanakanaruchi" was capped with kalpanaswaras for the Ramanadhapuram Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar krithi ``Anudidamunu" (Rupakam). ``Kolaritho" in Yadukulakhambodi and Tygaraja's ``Banturithi" in Hamsanadam did duty as brisk fillers.Replete with anuswara-laden gamakas, jarus, karvais and brigas, the main raga, a stimulating Kharaharapriya, was presented with assurance. However, the inclusion of more madhyama kala phrases would have helped to achieve a well-rounded delineation. Tyagaraja's ``Pakkala nilabadi" (Misra chapu) featured satisfactory neraval and swaras at ``Tanuvu che vandana." The attractive tone and timbre of the artiste's voice added lustre to tukkadas ``Nagavulu" (Yamunakalyani), ``Brahmam okate" (Hindolam) and a tillana in Hindolam.K.P.Nandini kept pace with the demands generated by the vocalist's Begada and Kharaharapriya, with her melodious and fluent violin accompaniment.R. Hemant's playing on the mridangam added punch with judiciously chosen phrases and his tani, though short due to lack of time, was absorbing.Bottom Template Starts
