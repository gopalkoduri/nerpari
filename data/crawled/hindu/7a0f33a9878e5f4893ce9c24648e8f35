VTrichy Ganesan is a musician who suffuses into his music not only the relaxed and spontaneous style of the old timers of Carnatic music but also the  priority that they allocated to &#8216;kalpanasangeetham&#8217; or the art of improvisation. No wonder that his concert at Kalikotta Palace, Thripunithara, drew a huge crowd.&#8216;Viriboni&#8217; in raga Bhairavi, which employs all 10  gamaka patterns, is among the most complex of the varnams. Ganesan was a marvel in this one as he displayed the many dynamics in the chittaswaras and other swara passages, with his stupendous voice.T.H. Subramaniam on the violin and Changanassery B. Harikumar on the mridangam joined Ganesan in his endeavour to give a truly memorable concert.Harikumar complemented the vocalist fully yet made his presence felt with the reverberating tenor of his mridangam. The swara essays of Hamsadhwani for &#8216;Pahi sreepathe&#8217; was  a  harmonised rendition by all the three artistes.&#8216;Shivakama sundari&#8217; in Jaganmohini raga was followed by Rishabhapriya. Ganesan&#8217;s  swara, rendered  in three layas, was exceptionally noteworthy and this was amply supported by Harikumar. The vocalist&#8217;s melodic singing of  raga Begada gave so much sheen to the &#8216;vakra&#8217; passages. His otherwise full-throated voice achieved some remarkable modulations in this piece.&#8216;Eeshan Sabeshan&#8217; was another  composition rendered with finesse.   Subramaniam also excelled in giving his succinct interpretation of the raga.&#8216;Kulabirudunu brochukori,&#8217; a composition of  Tyagaraja set to Roopaka tala, showcased Ganesan&#8217;s penchant for briga-laden singing of  ragas. He gave a vigorous expression to the rather euphonic raga Devamanohari.The ragam tanam pallavi introduced in raga Behag, which is rarely taken as the main raga in Carnatic concerts, was one that evoked  musical ecstasy.In his elaboration of the raga, the vocalist etched  beautifully  the nishada &#8211; the jeeva swara of the raga, as his voice soared to the higher octaves and traversed the scale with effortless ease. The vocalist gave expression to several complex patterns in the pallavi phase set to Khandajati triputa tala, which was much appreciated by rasikas.He sang ragamalika swaras in Bilahari and Kalyanavasantham. The thaniavartanam by Harikumar and Susheelkumar on the ghatom was terse and enhanced  the pallavi.In &#8216;Seetharamanai Bhajichal,&#8217; set to Adi tala, the vocalist beautifully articulated the sweet  refrains of Mand raga.The concert was conducted under the aegis of Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha.
