VP.R. NairThe violin concert of Jayamohan at Changampuzha Park under the aegis of Edapally Sangeeta Sadas last week was an `all-Edapally artistes' performance.Instead of the usual varnam, Jayamohan started thekutcheriwith a `Mallari' (usually played by Nagaswara vidwans) in Gambheera natta, composed by leading violinist Ajithkumar, who also hails from Edapally. This was followed by `Vatapi' in Hamsadhwani and `Broncheva' in Khamas. He then sketched raga Mohanam in its every detail and played `paripahi' keerthanam. `Maarakodi' in Bahudari and `Nadalolude' in Kalyanavasantham were effortlessly rendered by him.The main piece of the concert was `Parvathi nayakane' in Shanmughapriya and themanodharma swaraswere beautifully rendered in ragamalika.A few thukkadas followed, including the `English Note.' The concert concluded with the famous Swati Tirunal Thillana in raga Dhanasri. The Thillana deserves special mention for the excellent percussion support given by Nandikeswara Rao whose vast experience of playing for dance programmes was evident in his performance.Excellent supportJayamohan was ably supported by Nandikeswara Rao on the mridangam, Elamakara Balachandran on the ghatom, Sairaj on the ganjira and Jayaraj on the mugharsangh. It gave the concert the effect of a `vadyavrinda' effect. The scintillating `Thani' was memorable.Bottom Template Starts
