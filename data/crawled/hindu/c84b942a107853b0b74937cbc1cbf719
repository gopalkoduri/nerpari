VGifted with a melodious voice and good vocal stamina, Kalapini enthralled the audience with her methodically presented khayals in ragas Yeman andTilak Kamod, besides a thumri in raga Kafi followed by a briefly rendered tarana in the same raga but with much aplomb.Kalapini&#8217;s opening khayal in raga Yeman &#8220;Deho gyan-daan mohey&#8221; set to the twelve-beat slow ektal was rendered at good length with the raga&#8217;s many hidden folds released with utmost melodic charmand intense musical depth. At every twist and turn she manoeuvred to reveal her individual musical capability. In the handling of the &#8216;alap-badhat&#8217; she did indicate her good sense of reposefulness and intelligently carried out her improvisations. Kalapini&#8217;s renderings were bold and with a very clear vocal refrain and tunefulness. The madhya teental composition &#8220;Taan de muraliya&#8221; was laced with a good number of delightfully deployed variations.Her next choice was in the colourful melody of the raga Tilak Kamod. The traditional composition set to the mid-tempo ten-beat jhaptal &#8220;Piya...sab tare&#8221; delighted for she sang with ease and charmingly improvised variations.She followed it with a brisk-paced tarana-like composition of her father in raga Desh. The thumri in raga Kafi &#8220;Kaise bharoon paani&#8221; was handled well and was followed with a well-structured tarana. The concluding bhajan was in the typical Kumar Gandharva format.
