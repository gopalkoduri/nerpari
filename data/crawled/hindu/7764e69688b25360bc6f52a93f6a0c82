VBellari M. Raghavendra sang under the patronage of Sushira, Shri Deshikachar's Academy of Music, Mysore, as part of a three-day music festival in memory of V. Deshikachar, a renowned flautist.Raghavendra's virile voice infused emotions into the compositions; and remarkable diction was another feature to which even the varna (&#8220;Vanajakshi&#8221;- Kalyani- Atta taala- Pallavi Gopala Iyer) was not an exception. The varna unfurled in different progressive speeds, exposing the singer's competence in all aspects of music: command over rhythm, awareness about the lyrical importance and mastery over vocal intonations.Nevertheless, the voice betrayed hoarseness at some points. A pronounced smoothness in progressions would have rendered his style pleasing and melodic, in addition to the emotive contents it inhered.The concert included compositions of deep sentimental aspects and profound wisdom like &#8220;Vanchatonu&#8221; (Karnaranjani-Muthayya Bhagavathar) and &#8220;Gurucharanam Bhajare&#8221; (Gangeyabhushini - Bellary Sheshagiri Achar). While the former composition portrayed the composer's humility and earnestness (in his prayer to the Goddess), the latter highlighted the composer's ardour and reverence in addressing the Guru.He developed the alapanas befitting the significances of compositions. The swaraprastara sections conformed to artistic and ideal principles, materialised with good taste in furtherance of creating a refined ambience.A healthy and creative understanding developed between the melody accompanist H.K. Narasimhamurthy (violin), and the percussionists Jayachandra Rao (mridanga) and V.S. Ramesh (morsing), collectively enhanced the lead artiste's extempore and imagination.&#8220;Swaminatha Paripalaya&#8221; (Naata - Dikshithar), &#8220;Shri Vasudeva Shri Ramanam&#8221; (Ramapriya - Vasudevacharya), raga-tana-pallavi in Saveri (&#8220;Kari Moravina&#8221;), &#8220;Mareyabeda&#8221; (Purandaradasa) and the like were other interesting inclusions.* * *On the concluding day, R.K. Padmanabha played veena, exhibiting astounding fluency in progressions and exceptional imagination in every evolvement. Abundance of gamaka, in all their variants and intricacies were a common feature in his renditions.He gave unusual twists to conventional phrases. Alapana in Shankarabharana (&#8220;Sarojadalanetri&#8221; &#8211; Shyamashastri) thrived on artistically woven arohana, avarohana and dhaalu gamakas creating an atmosphere of wonder. When he imaginatively merged them with andholita, sphurita and the like, one saw more than one shade of music.Liberal use of chords were his forte in enhancing the grandeur of the thana sections and likewise he presented the lyrics (&#8220;Sarojadalanetri&#8221;) by shading them with subtle graces on par with fine vocal inflections (observe for example, the neraval at &#8220;Saamagana Vinodini&#8221;).The percussionists G.S.Ramanujan (mridanga) and V.S. Ramesh (morsing) spellbound the audience with canorous beats framed into phrases denoting their maturity and imagination.&#8220;Mahaganapathim&#8221; (Naata-Dikshithar), &#8220;Vanajasana&#8221; (Shri Subbaraya Shastri - presented with due care and vision glorifying the Goddess, as envisioned by the composer), &#8220;Guruleka Etuvanti&#8221; (Gourimanohari -Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Dasanamadiko&#8221; (Nadanamakriya-Purandaradasa) were other interesting presentations.
