VG. JAYAKUMARCool and relaxed, the veteran flautist breathed life into the hollow bamboo stem. Sweet notes flowed forth creating an atmosphere of magical charm. The flautist was none other than N. Ramani, who has been enthralling audiences with his rich repertoire of music for the past six decades.Annual day feteThe occasion was the fourth annual day celebrations of the Dr.N.Ramani Academy of Flute held at Theerthapada Mandapam, Thiruvananthapuram. Dr. Ramani began his two-hour flute concert with one of the popular compositions of Muthuswami Dikshitar  -   `Vatapi Ganapathim Bhaje' in Hamsadwani set to Adi talam.Tyagaraja's `Nadaloludai' in Kalyana Vasantham, which calls upon the mind to become a lover of nada to attain heavenly bliss, followed next. Set in Rupaka talam, through this kriti Tyagaraja stresses the importance of nada, as being the manipulation of the swaras. He played a solo in Bindu Malini, which is a janya of Chakravakam. It was through Tyagaraja's composition `Entha Muddu' that the raga Bindu Malini gained popularity. Ramani gave a soulful rendition of the piece.Abheri was chosen as the main piece of the evening. Ramani began with a short ragavistaram. The composition was Tyagaraja's `Nagumomu' set to Adi talam. The thaniavarthanam saw Mavelikara Rajesh on the mridangam and Anchal Krishna Iyer on the ghatam displaying their prowess. Easwara Varma provided able support on the violin. Swati Tirunal's composition Pankaja Lochana in Kalyani began with Padmesh delineating the raga. Ramani took over from the kriti, which was set in Misra Chappu talam. Yet another Swati kriti `Chaliye kunjane' in Vrindavan Saranga was briskly played.The other compositions of the evening included the racy `Raghuvamsha Sudha' in Kadanakuthoohalam, noted for its gamaka prayogas and effortless playing on the flute The seasoned artiste's fingers moved gracefully across the instrument to play `Baro Krishna' (Ragamalika), `Visweswara Darsana Karo' (Sindhubhairavi).The flute concert concluded with a few thukkadas such as `Dhim thaku dhim' (Dhanasree) and `Katrinile varum gitam.'
