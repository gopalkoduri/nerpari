VSupported by a powerful voice and promising talent, Subha Ganesan's suave and melodious expression beginning with the &#8216;Vanajakshi' varnam in vilamba and durita kalams at the monthly concert at Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore, gave her confidence to launch &#8216;Vara Vallabha Ramana' (Hamsadhwani) and &#8216;Giripriyam Gangadharam' in Kadanakudhuhalam garnished with swaras with striking effect.Subha's raga alapana of Purvikalyani for the kriti, &#8216;Iniyagilum Ninai Maname' was replete with ripe phrases to bring out the raga swaroopa and lakshana. Her raga portrayal of Andholika for &#8216;Ragasudharasa,' sketched with creative prayogas and touches, brought out its splendour.Engaging recitalThe main piece of the kutcheri was the Thodi kriti, &#8216;Ninne Namminanu,' built up with brigha-oriented phrases and jarus scaling the tara sthayi panchama with ease. This was followed by an engaging session of niraval and kalpanaswaras. Subha signed off with a hymn on Lord Muruga in Chenjurutti.Padmanabha's violin accompaniment had the sweetness of touch throughout revealing creative flashes. Ganesan (mridangam) presented a vibrant thani. In sum, it was a delightful fare.
