VU.P. Raju presented a mandolin concert at  Kalikkotta Palace Auditorium, Thripunithura, during a memorial function to pay homage to Tripunithura S.K. Subrahamaniam, a staunch exponent of unalloyed Carnatic vocal.It was in the fitness of things that an instrumental concert was arranged to remember him because, S.K. was adept on the flute, as well. He eschewed it lest it should it affect his vocal music.U. P. Raju commenced  with the Ata tala varnam in Bhairavi (&#8216;Viriboni&#8217;), the only creation by Pachimiriyam Adiappayya, who was adored by Syama Sastri. A flurry of  swaras adorned the Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Raghunayaka&#8217; in Hamsadwani.  The contours of Vaagadheeswari was well demarcated by him and  tagged to it was &#8216;Paramaatmadu.&#8217;&#8216;Sobhillu&#8217; in Jaganmohini  was well received. Raju created a  regal aura while playing the piece.  &#8216;Bhajanaseyaraadaa&#8217; in Dharmavathi, composed by Mysore Vasudevachar, preceded a dainty portrayal of Mohanam through Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Kaapaali.&#8217;  Raga Neeroshta, which is known as &#8216;Puthrika&#8217; in the nomenclature of Harikeshanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar, was represented by &#8216;Raja raja rajithe,&#8217; a creation of Bhagavathar, which is more effective vocally, since it has to be rendered without the juxtaposition of one&#8217;s lips. Yet, Raju played it for variety. The programme was wrapped up with a dessert, in the form of a Mozart Symphony.T. H. Subrahmaniam played the violin with gusto. Nanjil Arul handled the mridangam and Thripunithura Radhakrisnan the ghatom.
