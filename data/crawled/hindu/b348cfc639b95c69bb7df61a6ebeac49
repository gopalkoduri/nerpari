VIn Poland, 2010 happens to be Fryderyk Chopin Year, marking the 200th birth anniversary of the legendary 19th-century Polish pianist-composer, who was born in 1810 and passed away at the young age of 39. In this context, Polish embassies have organised various events in many foreign countries, including India.This is so reminiscent of the worldwide celebrations organised by Austria in 1991 to commemorate the 200th death anniversary of the legendary composer Mozart (1756-91), who died when he was just 35 -- although Chopin festivals both in Poland and abroad have been far less substantial and far more subdued than the Mozart extravaganzas of 1991 in Austria and all over the world.Earlier this year the Polish Embassy in India had organised related programmes in collaboration with cultural and educational institutions in several cities including New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore and Pune. In Chennai, this past week, connoisseurs had the pleasure of listening to an exquisite solo piano recital by the eminent Polish pianist-composer Marek Drewnowski (pronounced Drevnovski).Intimate atmosphereThe concert, organised in partnership with Brhaddhwani, took place in a small and compact hall of the International School in Alwarpet, which overflowed with a small and sensitive audience consisting of connoisseurs, local musicians and young students. There was an intimate atmosphere and no microphones and loudspeakers. And in spite of the noise of the ceiling fans in the non-air-conditioned hall, the music sounded as authentic and captivating as it must have done when Chopin himself had played his pieces in a 19th-century Parisian salon!Marek Drewnowski began the hour-long concert with Chopin's variations on select works of Mozart and Scarlatti (who were greatly admired by Chopin). In the second half of the recital he rendered a small set of original Chopin themes (three waltzes, a polonaise, a mazurka, and a nocturne), all of them deeply soaked in the nostalgic sentiment so characteristic of the exiled Polish composer's national and musical vision. The entire performance was subtle and serene, and the immortal Opus 64 No. 2 (waltz) added a sparkling touch.The visiting maestro was introduced to the enthusiastic gathering by our own Western classical pianist Anil Srinivasan. Music lovers in Chennai are familiar only with one side of Anil's versatile concerns -- namely his joint ventures with Carnatic musicians. When and where can we hear him play Chopin himself, I wonder!
