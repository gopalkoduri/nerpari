V&#8220;Rare Concert Varnas&#8221; is the topic chosen by the World Music Centre (WMC) for a workshop that would benefit students, aspiring performers and active musicians, to be conducted by vocalist R.A. Ramamani on June 19, 20 and 21 at the WMC in Malleswaram.That such a wholesome and profound topic is chosen for a workshop and not for an evening&#8217;s lecture-demonstration is a fact to be commended, as the subject commands an unhurried and elaborate treatment. &#8220;I am taking up some interesting varnas that haven&#8217;t been sung too often on stage. We have an abundant treasure of varnas, but only 10 per cent of them are used in concerts. Such workshops will create an ideal platform for the interested to discover the hitherto unearthed ones and take them up for public presentations,&#8221; says Ramamani.&#8220;The Carnatic genre is blessed with a sea of kalpita (composed) sangita, which is a boon for learners, as lessons such as these are veritable guides to ragas and their scales. And performers use them as sparkling starters to flag off their concerts at a brisk pace,&#8221; she says.The nuances of the varna could be a lot more appreciable if one understands the complex format that comes under bothabhyasaandsabhaganam &#8212; it serves well for a learner and it qualifies itself for being taken up by professional performers too. &#8220;In fact varna is a stepping stone to concert forms,&#8221; says Ramamani. &#8220;It is an abbreviated form of the essential raga swaroopa, presents essential swara groupings and flashes the signature gamakas of a scale,&#8221; she says.When you consider the magnum opus &#8220;Viriboni&#8221;, the atta tala Bhairavi varna of Adiappaiya, the majestic personality of the raga comes across in every line of the swara and sahitya passages, and it is said it is equivalent to the code of western musical form, feels musicologist Dr. S. Bhagyalekshmy in her book on musical forms. This is the reason experts say singing varnas in daily practice sessions in two speeds helps one gain voice, pace and raga control.Ramamani will take up some gems that are yet to become familiar with performers and students. Mysore Vasudevachar&#8217;s Tana varna in Kadanakutuhala; Ghanam Krishna Iyer&#8217;s Pada varna in Jhampe tala; and &#8220;Neerajakhshi&#8221; in Saveri by Veena Seshanna are some of the varnas that need to be explained for creating awareness about their stunning musical form, she says. &#8220;This could help people taking up exams too.&#8221; Tana varnas have brisk movement of swara phrases with a regular tempo, while Pada varna generally weaves in a concrete story, mostly based on the shringara-bhakthi of the nayaka-nayaki relationship that helps in dance movements. Praise of the ruling kings and devotion to the Lord also form some of the subject matter. Daru varna, ragamalika varna, nakshatra ragamalika varna, grahabheda varna are some of the other variations that our music saints, at least 25 of them, have presented to us. &#8220;Varnas reflect the skills of the composer because of its complex structure,&#8221; says Ramamani.Workshops aren&#8217;t new for Ramamani as her exercises in pallavi and manodharma and a host of other topics have been a hit in several cities across the globe. She is the Vice-Principal of the Karnataka College of Percussion, founded by mridangist T.A.S. Mani. She is known for her penchant for avadhana pallavi (a composition simultaneously set in two different rhythmic cycles). Her collaborative vocal fusions with jazz musicians for albums and festivals have also become runaway hits.(Call 98452 52320 for registrations)
