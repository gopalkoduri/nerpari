Vijay Sarathy on the ghatam and Ramana on kanjira and morsing.The duo started their concert in Raag Hamsadhwani titledJalajakshi, a composition of Patnam Subramanyam Iyer, followed byMaha Ganapatim, composition of Muthuswamy Diksheetar in Nata Raga set to eka talam. The popular songNagumomuin Abheri raga was next item and set in Adi talam. In this piece, the duo missed on adjusting the violin tuning, as there was a mismatch of shruti between each of their instruments.They corrected it in the next Raag Malayamarutam, with the songManasa yetuloanother composition of Thyagayya. The highlight of the evening was the alap in Raag Charukesi where the duo showed their skill and dexterity.
