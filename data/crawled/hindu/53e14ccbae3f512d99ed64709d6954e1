VCOMMEMORATING THE 158th death anniversary of the unparalleled `vaggeyakara', Thyagarajaswamy, the local Thyagaraja Aradhana Trust under the stewardship of its president, C.S.N. Raju, organised a five-day fete of the recitals of his compositions starting from Pushyabahula Panchami  the day on which he attained liberation. Devotional fervour in addition to pomp   marked the fete at the Kalabharathi auditorium.``Thyagaraja stands specially revered not only for his lyrics replete with  instant flow of Bhakti but also for  splendid song form that involuntarily  flows in most appropriate `raga' and `tala' in praise of Rama," said  the chief guest, Sadguru K. Sivananda Murthy at the inauguration.  The guest  of honour at the evening's function, the CEO of Prasar  Bharathi, K.S. Sarma opined that music is a phenomenon, the philosophical  interpretation of which strikingly stands similar to that of it in scientific parlour, the quantum theory movement in physics in particular.The other guest of honour , former M.P., M.V.V.S. Murthy was all praise for the  the Tyagaraja Aaradhana Trust and the Visakha Music and Dance Academy, for their  dedicated service to Carnatic music.The dance programme titled `Thyagaraja Sangeetha Vaibhavam' , was a tolerable effort.  `Koluvaiunnade Kodandapani' (Devagandhari), `Muchhata Bramhadulakaina' (Madhyamavathi), `Dorakuna Ituvantiseva' (Bilhari), `Pancharatnakrithi Kanakanaruchira' (Varali), `Sringarinchukoni Vedaliri' (Surati) and `Poolapanpumeeda' (Ahiri) were the items that were presented separately in the Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam idioms. While the `nattuvangam' was provided by the choreographer Naatyacharya Avasarala Rukmaji Rao , Dwaram V.K.G. Thyagaraju rendered vocal support evocatively  in the company of M. Edukondalu on the `mridangam', K.V.S. Prasad on the violin and Raja Rao on the flute. Make-up by Surya Rao was excellent. K.V.S. Rama Sarma was the master of ceremonies.Suguna Rani, Deepthi Manasa, Sindhumadhavi, Vasudha, Radharani, Kaavyasri, Rajani, Soumyasri, Sirisha, Meghana, Hemalatha, Sravanthi, Priyanka and Samyukta did well in sustaining the tempo.The next four days witnessed about 40 recitals and the  fete concluded on a grand note with `anjaneyotsavam' and `mangalahaarathi.'A.R.S.Bottom Template Starts
