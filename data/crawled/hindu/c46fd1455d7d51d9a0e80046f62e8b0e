VNo fuss, no frills. This initial impression on listening to Kasthuri Kamala Deepthi, a young vocalist from Vizag, deepened to a further sense of relief as the artiste allowed her natural instincts to take over rather than succumb to the prevalent tendency to adopt an applause-driven format. Handling gamakas with assertiveness sans excess and displaying fidelity to patanthara, Kasthuri&#8217;s recital at the TTD Information Centre was a credit to her guru, Pantula Rama. Tha\u000at the young vocalist has worked hard on her basics was evident in the strongly anchored, sruti-aligned shadja that had body and strength. What she needs to work on with equal diligence is the pin-point accuracy of take-off notes in raga passages.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Pariyachakama&#8217; (Vanaspathi) was adapted to a pace suitable for tapping into the distinct flavour of this vivadhi raga (mela 4). In the Ritigowla alapana, vadi-samvadi clusters came into play, the swaraprastara for Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Dwaithamu Sukhama&#8217; highlighting the ability to build tempo within the benign environs of sarvalaghu.A switch to the fast track came with Patnam Subramania Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;Garudagamana&#8217; after a spirited sketch of Nagaswaravali, the artiste&#8217;s penchant for building attractive patterns in kalpanaswara again surfacing in the ensuing part.  After Annamacharya&#8217;s &#8216;Vande Vasudevam&#8217; (Sri), Kasthuri got down to serious business. Young blood fired the veins of Varali, summoning an impassioned statement which would have acquired more weight had there been a little less hurry and a little more deliberation. A competent niraval surfaced in the line, &#8216;Aravinda&#8217; in Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Seshachala Nayakam&#8217;. The swara kanakkus, while adding spice, could have been engineered with added care to ensure percentage accuracy. Mysore Vasudevachar&#8217;s &#8216;Nee Kela Daya Radhu&#8217; (Kadanakuthuhalam) zigzagged at a tempo faster than the artiste could handle. The main raga Khambodi  fared well, with an earnest attempt to generate prayogas of varied colour in the shadja-panchama suite in keeping with the majestic gait of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;O Rangasayee&#8217;.Kovai S. Chandran (violin) and Mannargudi N. Subramanian (mridangam) put their experience and artistry to good use, encouraging the young vocalist in her efforts.Bottom Template Starts
