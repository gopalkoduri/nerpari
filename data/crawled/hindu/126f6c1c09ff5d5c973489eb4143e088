VVarijashree Venugopal, accompanied by Anantsatyam (violin), S.V. Balakrishna (mridanga), and R. Ramesh(ghata), gave a vocal concert as part of the Ramanavami celebrations at Sri Kalyana Venkateshwara Temple, Bangalore, recently.The performance began with &#8220;Sarasuda&#8221;, the Saveri varna in adi tala, sung in a medium tempo and prefixed with a brief sketch of the raga. &#8220;Mooladharamurthe&#8221; in Hamsadhwani raga and aditala was bedecked with fluent kalpana swaras, and followed by the comparatively rare Thyagaraja composition &#8220;Rama Neevegani&#8221; in Narayani raga and adi tala, also supplemented with kalpana swaras.Mukhari was next taken up for a short alapana that incorporated the key elements of its identity, and preceded Thyagaraja's &#8220;Enthaninne Varninthu&#8221; in rupaka tala, presented with a few avartanas of kalpana swaras. &#8220;Manasa Sancharare&#8221;, the perennial favourite in Sama raga and adi tala was precursor to a melodious alapana of Kamboji, suffixed with the Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Ma Janaki&#8221; in adi tala. A compact neraval at &#8220;Rajarajavara&#8221; and kalpana swaras with some rhythmic permutations were augmented by appropriate support from the accompanying artistes. Among the concluding items of the concert were the ragamalika &#8220;Baro Krishnayya&#8221; and &#8220;Venkatachalanilayam&#8221; in Sindhubhairavi.The young vocalist displayed a good understanding of the finer aspects of the ragas handled by her, underscored by a clear voice perfectly aligned to sruthi, and commendable self assurance. More concert experience will no doubt bring about a greater sense of repose and maturity, and culminate in the full realisation of her ample potential.*** Flautists B.K. Anantharam and Amith Nadig, accompanied by J.K.Sridhar (violin), N. Vasudev (mridanga), and Bhargav H. (khanjira) presented a concert as part of the series at the same venue.A brisk rendition of the Abhogi varna in adi tala was followed by Dikshithar's &#8220;Siddhivinayakam&#8221; in Shanmukhapriya raga and rupaka tala, adorned with copious kalpana swaras. An impressive &#8220;Jagadanadakaraka&#8221; in Natta was followed by a brilliant exposition of Sreeranjini, which began rather unconventionally at the mandra sthayi dhaivatha and unfolded gradually to reveal the ineffable sweetness of the raga, especially in the tara sthayi, concluding with a torrent of fast-paced sancharas. Thyagaraja's &#8220;Sogasuga Mridangatalamu&#8221; in rupaka thala was rendered with some brisk kalpana swaras. A beautiful alapana of Kalyani was next, followed by another Thyagaraja composition, &#8220;Nidhichala Sukhama&#8221; in misra chapu thala.The alapana of Karaharapriya, the main raga of the evening, was of moderate length with a profusion of phrases in the tara sthayi. &#8220;Chakkani Rajamargamu&#8221;, the splendid Thyagaraja krithi in adi tala was rounded off with very brief kalpana swaras at &#8220;Kantiki Sundara&#8221; that ended with a stint of diminishing number of cycles at the dhaivatha, with exceptional violin and percussion support. A more exhaustive treatment of the earlier Kalyani suite, however, with comprehensive neraval and kalpana swaras, would have been preferable in the current context, since Sreeranjini, a raga closely allied to Karaharapriya had already been amplified in some detail, and since the gravity of the composition &#8220;Nidhichala Sukhama&#8221; warranted it. The concert, nevertheless, was remarkable for the virtuosity, aesthetic sensibilities and formidable technical prowess of the lead artistes.MADHAVI RAMKUMAR
