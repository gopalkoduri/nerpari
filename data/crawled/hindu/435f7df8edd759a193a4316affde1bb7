VWell known musicologist Dr. M.B. Vedavalli presented an engaging lec-dem on &#8216;Rare Ragas handled by Dr. Muthiah Bhagavatar'at the 110-year-old Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha, Chennai. One of the most versatile post-Trinity composers, Muthiah Bhagavatar has introduced about 27 rare ragas, which are derivatives of the melakarta ragas.Dr. Vedavalli elaborated on this subject and demonstrated about 10 compositions by presenting them vocally.The first kriti she chose was in Hamsadeepakam, a derivative of 23rd mela, Gowrimanohari. This ooudava sampoorna raga has krama swaras without vakra proyagam. &#8216;Sikhi Vahana' was the kriti she presented. The second is the now popular Karnaranjani, a spinoff from Kharaharapriya; &#8216;Vancha Thonuna' was the kriti with catchy chittaswaras.Muthiah Bhagavatar employed Maund, Buddha Manohari, Pasupathipriya and Niroshta, which have branched off from Dheera Sankarabharanam. Here the demo was with &#8216;Samayamithey' in Buddha Manohari, &#8216;Raja Raja Rajithe' in Niroshta and &#8216;Saravanabhava' in Pasupathipriya.All about symmetryDr. Vedavalli pointed out that these ragas carry constraints while employing sangatis and detailing because of the &#8216;varja' or &#8216;vakra proyagam,' and many a time, the arohanam and avarohanam may not be symmetrical. However, the Harikhambodi janya, Valaji, appears quite often on concert platforms because of its symmetry. Here again, the popular &#8216;Jalanadara Supeetasthe' was her choice.These were followed Rikthi Margini (&#8216;Dharsaname Janma') from Ramapriya, &#8216;Charanam Vijaya Saraswati' in Vijayasaraswati, an offshoot of Simhendramadhyamam, Mecha Kalyani, an offshoot of Mohanakalyani (&#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam') and concluded with a thillana in Hamsanandhi, a product of Damanasrama.Vedavalli managed time effectively with relevant references to the speciality, application and certain theoretical aspects of the ragas and their structure. She had support from Lalitha Sampathkumar (vocal), Bhagyalakshmi (violin) and young M.B. Harsha (mridangam).The lec-dem was followed by a function where the title &#8216;Sangeetha Sastra Ratna' was conferred on Dr. Vedavalli by Additional Solicitor General Mohan Parasaran. The sabha has instituted the title from this year exclusively for musicologists. It carries a citation and cash prize of Rs.10,000. Also, the fifth volume of &#8216;A Dictionary of South Indian Music and Musicians' compiled by Dr. Vedavalli was released by S.R. Janakiraman, and the first copy was received by Dr. Premeela Gurumoorthy.
