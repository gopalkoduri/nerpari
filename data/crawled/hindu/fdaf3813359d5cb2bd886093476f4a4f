VMaharajapuram Santhanam evolved a style that appealed to all sections of the audience. The legacy is carried on by his disciples and sons.   Maharajapuram Ramachandran reminds one so much of his illustrious father. His    heavy vocal command and powe\u000arful interpretation captivated the audience at his concert for the Indian Fine Arts Society. The concert, held at the Bala Mandir German Hall, was dedicated to  Syama Sastri. Ramachandran had structured his concert in a special fashion adding &#8216;ganam&#8217; (weight) to his &#8216;gaanam&#8217; (music) by selecting the compositions of Syama Sastri set in &#8216;gana&#8217; ragas like Nattai, Arabi, Varali and Sri.The opening number was &#8216;Pahimam Sri Rajarajeswari&#8217; in Nattai that took up  quarter an hour with steady rendition and a lengthy chain of swaras. The alapana of Arabi was suffixed by &#8216;Palayamam Paradevathe&#8217; once again with a band of kalpanaswaras in the end. Ramachandran adopted  a strong and forceful expression.Humility and passion that mark the compositions of Sastry were evident  in the Varali item, &#8216;Kamakshi Bangaru Kamakshi.&#8217; An elaborate essay of Poorvikalyani with right proportions of sancharas in the three segments was distinguished further by &#8216;Enneramum Un Namam,&#8217; a Tamil composition by Sastri. A highly intense niraval in &#8216;Anbudan Unnai Adaikkalam Adainthen&#8217; and the dashing kalpanaswaras were added attractions.True, Ramachandran&#8217;s scholarship surfaces in all aspects of his singing burnished with his experience. Nevertheless, on many instances these were employed more as an exhibition of  vocal articulation than an internalised expression of classicism. Especially, kalpanaswaras reached  turbulent heights, backed by  the accompanying artists. Surely there are better ways to underline profundity.M.A. Sundareswaran is always  a vocalist&#8217;s unbiased reflection on the violin. K.R Ganesh&#8217;s mridangam and Sundar&#8217;s morsing were more of a power and speed-driven affair.Bottom Template Starts
