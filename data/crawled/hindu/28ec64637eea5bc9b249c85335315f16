VK.C. ASOKBoth the vocalist and the violinist T.S. Subramoniam enthralled listeners with the raga, which was studded with traditional sancharas.The second day of the 30th Neelakanta Sivan Sangeetha Aradhana saw noted Carnatic vocalist Sanjay Subramaniam at his best. The concert was replete withRagalapanasandkalpana swara prayogas, reminiscent of age-oldsampradaya. His singing, which did not have even a single flat note, succeeded in highlighting theraga lakshanaand it regaledrasikas.Rare ragasThe incessant rain did not dampen the enthusiasm of the audience. Most of the items chosen were rare kritis; the concert began with a rare Ada tala varnam, `Neevandi daivamo... ' in Neelambari. `Maruvaku daya mohananga na pai... ' (Mohanam) was appended with some rare patterns ofmanodharma swaras. `Kandeen kali teerthen' in Shahana (Roopaka talam) and a slow `Nyayama meenakshiyamma' in Ahari (Adhi tala) were also adorned with impressiveragaalapanas.The Thyagaraja composition in this raga `Ammaravamma... ' was chosen forneraval, as well.The main item of the recital was `Paramatmudu belugu' in raga Vagadeeswari.  Both the vocalist and the violinist T.S. Subramoniam enthralled listeners with the raga, which was studded with traditionalsancharas.The vibrantthaniyavarthanamby Gururvayur Dorai and Uduppi Sreedhar followed. Dorai stole the show with his skilful but subtle percussion support.The short numbers included `Reenamadanuta' in Behag and `Adukiran ennul padukiran kannan' in Kapi. While emphasisingsruthi, laya, tala, ragalakshana, andkalpana swaram,the vocalist seemed to have put lyrical clarity on the backburner. The concert was rounded off with a Tillana in Khamas.Flute recitalNeelakanta Sivan kritis mostly figured in Kudamaloor Janardhanan's flute concert, the next day. `Neela kanta nityananda' ( Arabhi), `Orunnal Orupozhuthakilum Sivanamam... '(Khamas) and `Ananda nadamadiduvathille... '(Poorvikalyani) were skilfully handled. Ragam thanam pallavi in Kharaharapriya in Mishra chappu talam was the main piece while the concluding item was `Ennathapam cheyyeno Yasoda' in the melodious Kapi raga. Unlike the pervious day's concert, the spectators were exposed to popular ragas as well. However, with no accompaniment other than Vaippin Satheesh on the mridangam and Adichanalloor Anil Kumar on the ghatom, it was a demanding venture for the artiste.The organisers  commemorated the late S. Umamaheswaran (an active member of Neelakanta Sivan Sangeetha Sabha), by dedicating the day's programmes in his name.Bottom Template Starts
