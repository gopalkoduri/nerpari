VThe second Kalpa Druma Arts and Artists&#8217; annual festival featured two music concerts apart from a music appreciation programme by Sampradaya, at the  Sivagami Pethachi auditorium. The aesthetic stage d&#233;cor was  testimony to Kalpa Druma&#82;\u000a17;s artistic inclination.The first day&#8217;s concert was thematic as is the trend these days and T.M.Krishna had chosen the five main elements of the universe.If it is &#8216;Pancha Bootham,&#8217; the composer has to be  Muthuswami Dikshitar, who has identified the five centres of Siva  and composed exclusive compositions on them.Krishna started his recital with a verse from Kalidasa&#8217;s &#8216;Abignana Sakunthalam&#8217; following it up with &#8216;Ananda Natana Prakasam&#8217; (Kedaram) referred to &#8216;Akasam&#8217; (Sky).His quick-fire swaraprasthara at &#8216;Sangeetha Vadya&#8217; with fluent jandai swara application added appeal to the slow rendition.&#8216;Vayu&#8217; (Air) was represented by &#8216;Srikalahastheesa&#8217; in Huseni. Here too, Krishna infused zest with a few rounds of swaras covering the special notes of Huseni backed finely by Mannargudi Eswaran (mridangam), T.V.Vasan (ghatam) and R.K.Sriramkumar (violin).Saranga alapana and &#8216;Arunachala Natham&#8217; were illuminative of &#8216;Agni&#8217; (Fire). Krishna&#8217;s concise Bhairavi exposition gave a build-up to &#8216;Chintayama&#8217;  featuring &#8216;Prithvi&#8217; (Earth).The highlight of the concert was the Ragam Tanam Pallavi in Sankarabharanam set in Kanda Jathi Jampa Talam in Kanda nadai and a masterly stroke with the pallavi &#8216;Panchanana Pancha Boothakara Vibo Pahimam Sambo.&#8217;Krishna&#8217;s raga alapana of Sankarabharanam probed the  depths of emotion and touched the pinnacle of excitement.  Krishna&#8217;s  exaggerated  hand gesticulations and facial expressions complimented the content.The tanam was high voltage stuff rendered with  &#233;lan including breathtaking passages leading  to a dramatic climax.Several sangatis with perfect &#8216;trikalam&#8217; made it an excellent exercise with brilliant support from Mannargudi Eswaran and Vasan in the percussion area.The conclusion came with a  stretched out &#8216;Jambupathey&#8217; in Yamunakalyani, referring to the fifth of the five elements &#8216;Appu&#8217; (Water) and the finale with a special mangalam in Surutti composed  by violinist R.K.Sriram Kumar.Sriram Kumar demonstrated controlled perfection on the violin with a strong hold on melody though the vocalist employed embroidered idioms in many places. Eswaran and Vasan regaled the audience with a thunderous thani avartanam with innumerable varieties of amazing rhythmic configurations.
