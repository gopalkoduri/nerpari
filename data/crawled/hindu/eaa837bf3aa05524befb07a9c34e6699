VBharat Sundar is one of the most promising up and coming vocalists in the Carnatic horizon today. Those who have been listening to him in recent times and heard his Karaharapriya at the Nadopasana concert will agree with the above statement. The build-up was slow, soft and steady replete with innumerable pithy and poignant phrases conveying the raga swaroopa in no uncertain terms. Added to that was his emphasis on the emotional quotient with extremely endearing karvais, sways, glides and swirls.Karaharapriya unlocked almost the entire gamut of its beauty and intensity in Bharat&#8217;s deliberation. &#8216;Pakkala Nilabadi&#8217; was the kriti and the infrequent line &#8216;Manasuna Talacheemai&#8217; was taken up for niraval. The swara segment was rather brief in comparison to the niraval. Once again, it was musical wisdom that took precedence over the arithmetic.Bharat&#8217;s penchant for eliciting the raga&#8217;s delicacy was evident even in his starting &#8216;Valachi&#8217; varnam. His first kala rendition carried more accents on the finer nuances of each raga in this unique varnam lined up with nine melodies. &#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam&#8217; in Chamaram moved smoothly with niraval and swara strands at &#8216;Chatra Chamara Pari Veejitham&#8217;.&#8216;Etavuna Ne&#8217; in Yadukulakhambodi provided enough scope for this young singer to employ all his expertise to demonstrate his facility to tune himself daintily to the extended prayogas of this particular raga. Did one feel the concert was progressing on a rather sedate and laid back mode? True. But at the same time, one could understand that the singer had totally surrendered to the subtleties of classical musical and took the listener along with him which was, in fact, a more gratifying journey. The closing segment saw a couple of items on a faster mode. &#8216;Ma Ramanan&#8217; in Hindolam could not fit comfortably in the rapid pursuit while the Behag tillana of Lalgudi Jayaraman suited the pace.R. Kailasam&#8217;s slightly low-key violin support highlighted Bharat&#8217;s singing. R. Sankaranarayanan&#8217;s rhythmic cycles were in the right decibels, not over powering the supple rendition of Bharat Sundar.Bhairavi and Malavidefinitely exhibited their proclivity to offer good music. Their voices carry a heavier tenor than the usual syrupy tinge of female vocalists, and their presentation was filled with buoyancy. In their concert at the Dakshinamurthy Auditorium of PS High School for Nadopasana, Shanmukhapriya came first for marking out by Malavi. She was able to impress on the specialty of the raga with few karvais and many sweeps and akaras. Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Kannanai Pani Maname&#8217; and the swaras followed established their understanding of concert culture.&#8216;Paramapurusham&#8217; in Lalithapanjamam of Swati Tirunal provided a fast link between the main raga and the warm up of the show.Bhairavi detailed Bilahari through tonal control and employed captivating phrases. The choice here went for the less heard Dikshitar number &#8216;Kamakshi Varalakshmi&#8217; with fairly exhaustive niraval and swaras on the line &#8216;Vasudeva Parabrahma Jaaye&#8217;. With the lack of glamour in their voices, the duo had to necessarily bank on presentation strength to sustain the interest. A little dose of finesse and careful avoidance of hairline shifts in swarasthanas will benefit the duo and make the concert more engaging.C.K. Vijayaraghavan could have given more emphasis on the raga vinyasas instead of methodic climbs and descents. Kumbakonam Swaminathan and H. Prasanna on percussion gave creditable support. The post thani included an interesting ragamalika &#8216;Thillai Vazhiye Kadandu&#8217; and a khayal of Swati Tirunal &#8216;Aaj Aaye Sham&#8217;.Vijayalakshmi Subramanyam&#8217;s vocal recital at the same venue for Nadopasana was distinguished by her concerned treatment of Khambodi supported by Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Sri Subrahmanyaya Namaste&#8217;. The raga expose  slithered through swift and definite movements to the middle and upper regions and was brought back in the same manner without much stop over at any section. Nevertheless, this pr&#233;cis was compensated by the choice of the kriti &#8216;Sri Subrahamanyaya&#8217; rendered with grandeur and decorated through interestingly woven layers of kalpanaswaras on &#8216;Namaste&#8217;.Earlier, Vijayalakshmi delighted listeners with two ragas of unique character &#8212; Huseni and Kanakangi.Huseni intrinsically has a subdued lilt and a brief alapana touching the fine phrasings of the raga and the slow and sedate number &#8216;Eppadi Manam Thunindado&#8217; of Arunachala Kavi fitted well in the middle of her concert. Similarly, alapana with poise of Kanakangi was done for the Koteeswara Iyer kriti &#8216;Kanakanga Ka&#8217;.A few cycles of swarakalpana in this raga added allure to it. &#8216;Ammaravamma&#8217; in Kalyani with fast paced kalpanaswaras in &#8216;Tamarasa Dalanetru&#8217; were expertly handled by her.Charumathi Raghuraman&#8217;s matured responses in raga alapanas and kalpanaswaras on the violin were a significant plus to the concert.The percussion artists Mannarkoil Balaji and Adambakkam Shankar on the mridangam and ghatam matched the tempo of Vijayalakshmi&#8217;s recital. &#8216;Era Naapai&#8217; the Todi varnam and &#8216;Ramabhakti Samrajya&#8217; in the leisure mode initiated the programme.
