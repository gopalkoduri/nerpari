VVirgin Records has released a devotional album titled &#8216;Bhakti Samarpan,&#8217; an assortment of bhajans drawn from films and other private albums. Of the 11 songs, three  are by Lata Mangeshkar.The striking aspect is that all of them have been sung at different point of time. Yet her voice has not lost the sheen as is proved in the new song, &#8216;O Palanhare,&#8217; the Javed Akhtar&#8217;s lyric turned into a beauty by A.R.Rahman.The other two are &#8216;Allah Tero Naam&#8217; from Hum Dhono (Music-Jaidev, Lyrics-Sahir Ludhianvi) and Meera Bhajan &#8216;Payoji Maine Ram Ratan Ki Garm&#8217; (Music-Hridayanath Mangeshkar).It also has the super hit of the yore &#8216;Jaise Suraj Ki Garmi Se&#8217; from  &#8216;Parinay,&#8217; sung with gusto by Sharma Bandhu (Music-Jaidev, Lyrics-Ramanand Sharma).A bhajan collection can never be complete without songs of Anup Jalota and Jagjit Singh. Rightly, the producers have included bhajans of both (these singers) with gifted voice.The bhajans, &#8216;Tum Karuna Ke Sagar Ho&#8217; and &#8216;Patit Pawan Naam Tiharo&#8217; penned by Kavi Narayan Agrawal has been set to tune by Jagjit Singh.As is the order of Singh&#8217;s bhajans, these too put you into meditative mood what with his baritone voice laced throughout with his harmonium.&#8216;Jag Mein Sundar Hai Do Naam&#8217; (Music &amp; lyrics-Anup Jalota) one of the most popular bhajans of Anup Jalota, known for turning the listener emotional, also finds a place in the album. The strains of the harmonium in  &#8216;Shiridiwale Baba,&#8217; (Music-Mukesh Tiwari, lyrics- Dr.Ram Vallabh Acharya) in the quawaali type  is noteworthy with an effective rendition by Jalota. Popular Hindi devotional singer Hari Om Sharan has rendered &#8216;Tera Ramji Karenge Beda Paar&#8217; (Music-Murali Manohar Swaroop, lyrics-Nirdosh) in his inimitable style that is rich in meaning.A differently tuned Aarti song on Lord Ganesha by Ahsaan Ahmed (Lyrics-Vijay Akela) from the film, &#8216;My Friend Ganesha&#8217; has Roop Kumar Rathod singing it with feel. Pandit Jasraj&#8217;s &#8216;Hanuman Lala&#8217; (Music &#8211;Kedaar Pandit) is the icing on the cake. Jasraj goes into a swara phase with counters from sarod. The album ends with a chorus that is very effective.  This collection, a mixture of both old and new bhajans, is bound to take the devotees on a nostalgic journey.Virgin Records (India) Pvt.
