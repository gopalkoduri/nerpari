VJAYARAMAN VFaiyas Khan from Dharwad is a competent vocalist, proficient tabla player and perhaps the only professional musician who plays the sarangi in South India.Versatile performanceLovers of North Indian music were treated to Faiyas' versatility at a programme at Hotel Abad, Chullikkal (Mattanchery). Organised by ISCRA and Shudh Kalyan, the jugalbandi saw him playing the sarangi while Ravindra Katoti and Nizar Ahamad played the harmonium and the tabla respectively.Ravindra started the concert with an alap in Madhuvanti with feather-touch slides on the reeds as Faiyas began every sequence with a flourish on the sarangi. This was followed by a composition in Madya and Dhruth, set to ek tal and theen tal respectively. Faiyas took care to show the visage (Mohra) of the raga embedded in the bandish, singing simultaneously while playing on the sarangi. Both started performing together with infinite improvisations to dovetail the recital into small segments.`Sargham' or rendering of swaras, traversing the lower and higher octaves, was cleverly marked by Nizar on the tabla. The lilt inherent in the raga `Maand' emanated from the harmonium in `gayaki' style and it was garnished by fast `taans,' produced, at times, vocally by Faiyas. Its ultimate expression was through a composition in Khaherva.The second session started with Faiyas in the role of a vocalist presenting a picturesque `Puria Dhanasree' (Kamavardhini). Bandish in Madhya (theen tal) and Dhruth were made lustrous by Katoti playing the lead and Nizar coming up with Parans and Tehais.The final session was devoted to ghazlas in Pahadi, Bhairavi and so on.Bottom Template Starts
