VThe text Dattilam describes music as a Gaandhara denoting the sacredness of the Indian music. The book provides succinct definitions of Swara, Thala, Pada. Avadhana essentially refers to concentration. Dattilam denotes sruti as the dominant feature over swaras.Another feature described in Dattilam are gramas. The gramas are Shadja and madhyama in nature, the Gandhara category is not in vogue.Sage Dattila gives an exposition on Vadi, Samvadi and Vivadhi swaras.Dattilam categorises &#8216;Murchanas&#8217; which are either Shadavam or Audavam in nature. (Pentatonic or hexatonic).Dattilam refers to &#8216;vritti&#8217;, the sage categorises them as three, namely, &#8216;Vritti&#8217;, &#8216;Dakshina Vritti&#8217; and &#8216;Chitra Vritti.&#8217; In the first category the song is dominant, song and vadya embellish each other in the second and vadya is the dominant in the third. The treatise then refers to jatis. There are four varnas namely Sthayee, Sanchari, Aarohi and Avarohi. Dattilam has specified 13 alankaras which are decorative embellishments.  The topic of thalas is the next feature dealt with in Dattilam. These are &#8216;Yugma&#8217; and &#8216;Ayugma&#8217; that is even and odd. Dhruta, Madhyama and Vilambit are also discussed with reference to tempos.
