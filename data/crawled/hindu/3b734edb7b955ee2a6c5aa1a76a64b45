VSticking to the padantharam of their guru Musiri Subramania Iyer, the Bombay Sisters warmed up with a varnam &#8216;Sarasijanabha&#8217; in Natta and followed it with a daruvarnam (dance form) in Huseini.The major attraction of the evening, however, was the alapana of the sampoorna ragam Todi. The kriti was &#8216;Deva Deva Mam Palaya,&#8217; set to misra chappu talam. Without compromising on the sahitya, the sisters enriched the listeners with their outpouring of apt gamaka prayogas and smooth swara sancharam. The rendering proved beyond doubt their mastery over one of the most difficult ragas in Carnatic music.V. Sanjeev moved the bow across his violin with finesse, giving full support to the vocalists.The thaniavartanam that followed saw Madipakkam Suresh playing  well-calculated laya patterns, and matching them  with dexterous finger movements was Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam.Asaveri, a janya of Todi, was noted for its karuna rasam.The emotional content in the voices of the sisters was felt in the kriti &#8216;Deva Palaya Murare.&#8217;The other Swati Tirunal compositions that  they rendered included &#8216;Deva Deva Jagadeeswari&#8217; in Poorvikalyani and &#8216;Karunakara Madhava&#8217; in Begada.Paying respects to T.K.Govinda Rao, who perfected their sahitya bhava in singing, the Bombay sisters presented one of his tillanas in Behag.They also rendered a Kannada composition &#8216;Vande Pahi Vande,&#8217; created by Gopaladasar in Kappi.The vocal concert ended with the melodious mangalam &#8216;Bhujaga Sayino Nama Mangalam.&#8217;
