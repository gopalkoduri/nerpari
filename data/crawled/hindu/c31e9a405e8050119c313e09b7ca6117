VK.J.Yesudas has created a record of sorts by singing and recording 16 songs, all in a single day! But the singer says with all humility: "Today it is not a big thing. You have all the facilities. Technology has improved a lot. But that was not the situation 20 years ago when I sang and recorded 11 songs in a day." And for the eleventh song, he bagged the State award that year. The song was `Neelajalasayathil' for the film `Angeegaram.'The 16 songs were sung by Yesudas in four languages for the film `Malikapurathu Amman,' produced in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. The film is directed by Ramankutty.The music director is Sivaji Raja who has composed music for more than 40 films in Telugu and Tamil. About the songs and his experience working with Yesudas, he says: "It is a great privilege to have Yesudasji. He is really a gift to Indian music. See, even now he can sing in all the sthayis  -   from baritone, to madhyam and to thara sthayi with ease. And his pronunciation andbhavaare just superb. You cannot compare him with any other singer in India. He was kind enough to be at the AVM RR Studios all throughout the recording session, singing in all the four languages. I have also introduced a new female voice Pratibha from Palghat."The lyricists are Vali (Tamil), Nanda Kumar (Kanada), Unnikrishnan Meetl (Malayalam) and Sivaji Raja (Telugu). The film is produced by Abel. The film, shot at Sabarimala and other temples of Kerala, has newcomer Bhushan in the lead role.Of late, Yesudas has been making inroads into many fields including literature. He has written a couple of poems, important among them being `Anweshanam' (search) in Malayalam. Its Hindi translation is being brought out soon by the Hindi Prachar Sabha.G.
