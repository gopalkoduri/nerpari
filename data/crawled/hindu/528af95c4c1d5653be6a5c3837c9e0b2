VLALITHAA KRISHNANSeetha Narayanan presented a vocal concert based on the compositions of Patnam Subramania Iyer, under the aegis of the Music Academy.The challenge of having to structure the programme within a framework of limited choices was met with aplomb by the artiste. The economy exercised in the number of kritis presented was offset by extensive alapana, neraval and swaraprastara.The burnished sheen of Mukhari touched the alapana and the leisurely-paced kriti `Eppudu Kripa Galgunaa' (Adi) and turned them to gold. Suffused with a lambent glow, the neraval at the line `Thalli Thandri' dwelt at length upon the kizhkala movement before moving on to the melkala, which was handled with dexterity.The Bilahari alapana was anchored by strong pidis that lent solidity and helped imbricate a progression of layers towards the impeccably aligned tara stayi shadja.The voice was clear and unclouded, with a ringing quality in the upper register. The composition `Paridaanamichite' (Misra chapu) with neraval at `Rokkamichutaku' registered with impact.Concise sancharasKalyani presided as the main raga, stately and elegant. The emphasis was on concise, weighty sancharas rather than karvais.No specific area was singled out for attention. Instead the preference was for a comprehensive overview in which equal attention was bestowed upon salient aspects. The kriti was `Nijadasa Varada' (Adi, 2 kalai).The neraval saw the artistes in full flow, continuing unfazed even when there was a brief power failure.The  charming nuances of Khamas were enmeshed in the javali `Apudu Manasu' and a spirited, seldom-heard tillana in Sindubhairavi, aroused from long hibernation, rounded off the evening's undiluted classical fare.The accompanists, R. Hemalatha (violin) and Thanjavur Kumar (mridangam) displayed exemplary precision and control.Bottom Template Starts
