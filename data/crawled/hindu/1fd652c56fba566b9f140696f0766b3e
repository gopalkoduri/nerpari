VKunnakudi M.Balamuralikrishna&#8217;s vocal concert conducted under the aegis of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, at G.K.D. Auditorium, Coimbatore, bore evidence to the fact that the child prodigy has blossomed into a seasoned vocalist.With the strong foundation he received from his earlier gurus, (his father Meenakshi Sundaram, Neyveli Santhanagopalan and V.Sundaresan), and the present chiselling by P.S. Narayanaswamy, Balamuralikrishna&#8217;s performance sparkles in myriad colours. His voice is as majestic as it is malleable and obeys his every command. His raga delineation is filled with depth and his animated swaraprastharas strike a fine balance between melody and rhythm.After a brief outline of Bhairavi, Balamuralikrishna began with Pachimiriyam Adiyappayya&#8217;s  varnam, &#8216;Viriboni&#8217; and followed it with &#8216;Vallabha Nayakasya&#8217; by Dikshitar in Begada. Periaswamy Thooran&#8217;s &#8216;Murugaa, Murugaa Endraal&#8217; was a real treat with the Saveri alapana that preceded it.The raga that appeared in its complete form with the first few phrases was more mesmerising  as he rendered  more phrases soaked in the raga bhava.The same can be said about Kalyani which he presented as the main raga for the kriti, &#8216;Etaavunara&#8217; by Tyagaraja.Balamuralikrishna&#8217;s  presentation of &#8216;Inka Dhayaraaledaa Naa Pai&#8217; in Chakravaham by Patnam Subramaniya Iyer carried the emotion of the sahitya powerfully.After the leisurely &#8216;O Jagadamba&#8217; by Syama Sastri, &#8216;Srikantha Neeyeda&#8217; in Bhavapriya by Tyagaraja followed with absolute briskness with fast kalpanaswaras.Arunachalakavi&#8217;s &#8216;Raamanaitharuvaay Jagatrakshakaa&#8217; in Sindhubhairavi was lovely. Balamuralikrishna concluded his concert with a tillana and a Thiruppugazh.Anayampatti G.Venkatasubramaniyam, a disciple of the scions of the Parur School, did his gurus proud with his sensible support and convincing depiction of the ragas.Thanjavur Ramadass, the veteran mridangist, gave excellent support and topped it with an impressive thani avartanam.
