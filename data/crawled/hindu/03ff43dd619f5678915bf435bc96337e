VThe Ramakrishnapuram South Indian Society and the Delhi Tamil Sangam jointly organised a programme to pay homage to the well known Carnatic vocalist late Mahajanam Shriramamurthy this pastweek. Tributes were paid by both the organisations followed by a musical homage to the late guru by his disciples Jayanthi Iyer, Gowri Jagannathan, Geetha Narayanaswamy and Rajini Haran.Veteran vocalist Mahajanam Shriramamurthy, who taught a number of students in the Capital, passed away recently at the age of 82. The programme culminated with a scintillating concert by Delhi's Vasanthi Krishna Rao for about two hours. Vasanthi is the daughter and disciple of late K.R. Kumaraswamy Iyer. The structure of her concert, selection of compositions and ragas as well as interweaving of her creative talents turned out to be a delightful experience for the audience.Vasanthi began her concert with the Kamboji raga Ata tala varnam in two talas and in a riveting kalaparamanam (tempo of the tala). The invocation song on Lord Ganesha was Muttuswami Dikshitar's &#8220;Ekadantam&#8221; in raga Bilahari. Puliyur Doreswamy Iyer's &#8220;Sarasiruhasana&#8221; in raga Nattai was impressively presented and culminated in crisp and lively swaraprastaras.Tamil compositionsVasanthi then took up two Tamil compositions, namely, Achyutadasa's &#8220;Sadananda tandavam&#8221; in raga Bahudari and Papanasam Sivan's &#8220;Senthil andavan&#8221; in raga Kharaharapriya for somewhat detailed presentation. These songs were preceded by fine delineation of the ragas and suffixed by swaraprastaras that flowed with rich creativity. The fast tempo &#8220;Anupamagunambudhi&#8221;, a composition of Tyagaraja in raga Atana, kept the proceedings lively.The central item of Vasanthi's concert was Tarangampadi Panchanada Iyer's &#8220;Biranabrova ide&#8221; in raga Kalyani. Apart from a good presentation of the composition, Vasanthi brought out the complete features of this raga in her detailed delineation. The creative talents of the artiste came to the fore during the subsequent neraval of the phrase &#8220;Ni pada pankajamu nera namminavadugada&#8221; and swaraprastaras that included a crisp finishing korvai.Vasanthi's post-tani avartanam (percussion solo) session too was engaging. She included in this portion a scintillating Tamil composition in raga Bihag, an emotive bhajan in raga Maduvanti and a tillana in Mohana Kalyani.Delhi's R. Sridhar on the violin and K.N. Padmanaban on the mridangam rose to the occasion and provided excellent support throughout this concert. In particular, Sridhar's sketch of ragas Bahudari and Kharaharapriya were delightful. Padmanaban's understanding percussion support and an enthralling tani avartanam in Adi tala (tisra gati) were noteworthy aspects of the concert. Rajeshwari Shankar, a disciple of Vasanthi Krishna Rao, provided good vocal support. A little more balancing of the sound system would have enabled a more comfortable listening experience. On the whole, a memorable evening of tribute and Carnatic music.
