VK.Dharini, disciple of Sulochana Pattabhiraman, showed immense promise during her vocal recital. The stage is not new to her as she has been participating regularly in &#8216;Abaswaram&#8217; Ramjhi&#8217;s &#8216;Isai Mazhalai&#8217; programme.With a pleasantly husky voice, she breezed through the alapanas and swarakalpanas with absolute ease. The varnam &#8216;Om Pranava Vimala Ganapathi&#8217; by Thyagarajan was lovely with sahityas for the charanaswaras. She portrayed Malayamarutham and Shanmukhapriya beautifully for &#8216;Karpaga Manohara&#8217; and &#8216;Parvathi Naayakane&#8217; (both by Papanasam Sivan). Her niravals and kalpanaswaras were enjoyable. It is true that there is still scope for improvement, but she is on the right track. Dharini sang &#8216;Ganamazhai Pozhigindraan,&#8217; &#8216;Kaakkai Siraginile&#8217; and concluded her brief concert with Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s thillana in Kalyanavasantham and a Thiruppugazh. G.Badrinath&#8217;s violin was smooth and melodious. Prasanna Karthikeyan on the mridangam  produced  pleasing laya patterns.N.Shubhasree (disciple of Mutharasi Ravi) presented the Pushpanjali in Gambhira nattai, a Ganapati padam in Gowla, and a sthuthi on Ambal in Kedara Gowla prior to the varnam &#8216;Innum En Manam Ariyaadhavar Pol&#8217;, in Charukesi by Lalgudi Jayaraman during her Bharathanatyam recital.She depicted the love-lorn heroine authentically with her facial expressions and body language, at the same time exhibiting remarkable footwork for the lively jatis incorporated in the varnam.Shubhasree concluded her recital with the thillana by K.N. Dhandayuthapani Pillai. The orchestra comprising Sudhev Varriar (vocal support), Mutharasi Ravi (nattuvangam), Venkata- subramanian (mridangam) and Shankar (violin) proved a great strength to Shubhasree&#8217;s dance presentation.
