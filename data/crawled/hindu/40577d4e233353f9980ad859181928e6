VRajakamal's flute recital at\u000aGanabharathi, Mysore,\u000acommanded unreserved\u000aaccolades: the three young\u000aartistes including the melody\u000aaccompanist, H.N.Smitha and\u000athe rhythm accompanist, P.S.\u000aShridhar, raised the concert to\u000agreat heights in matters of melody,\u000aexperience and scholarship.The artiste's sense of aesthetics\u000aand clear understanding of\u000athe nature of the music he was\u000aplacing before the audience\u000amade the performance a distinguished\u000aone: alapanas, the lyrics\u000aand the embellishments harmonised\u000awith each other in a uniform\u000aflow of mood. It created an\u000aambience of quietude and oneness.\u000aThe flautist with his technical\u000acompetence was able to to uphold\u000aand enhance the dignity of\u000athe compositions and the art\u000aform. Such a predisposition on\u000athe part of the flautist spoke of\u000amaturity which he has imbibed\u000afrom wise teachers and which\u000ahe has carefully inculcated into\u000ahis own style.Consider Ranjani ("Durmargachara"\u000a- Thyagaraja) and Bilahari\u000a("Smarasadha" - Swathi\u000aThirunal). Methodical evolvement\u000aillustrated guidelines\u000aenunciated in Sangeetha Sampradaya\u000aPradarshini (Subbarama\u000aDikshithar): fulfilled the\u000arequirements of the components\u000aof an ideal alapana-akshipthika\u000a(prelude),\u000aragavardhini (the manner of developing\u000athe raga in different\u000astages in relation to swara, swara\u000aphrases and the kaala-s) and\u000athe like.Judiciously employed gamakas,\u000ainterspersed with adequate\u000apauses revealed both the ragachaya\u000aand the rasa embodied\u000atherein. The lyrics concerned\u000athat followed such alapanas,\u000ashone grandly by the fully exposed\u000asubtleties; and the meaningful\u000away of framing the\u000aswarakalpana served as remarkable\u000aproof of the artiste's\u000acomposure and discretion.\u000a"Chalamela" (Natakuranji-\u000aRangasami Natuvanar), "Raghunayaka"\u000a(Hamsadhwani-\u000aThyagaraja), "Varanaradha"\u000a(Vijayashri-Thyagaraja) and\u000a"Bhaavayaami" (Yamunakalyani-\u000aAnnamacharya) were other\u000ainclusions.Indudhar Nirodi, veteran\u000akhayaliya and a dhrupadiya as\u000awell, conducted a lecture demonstration\u000aat Bidaram Krishnappa\u000aRama Mandira.Touching all the salient features\u000aincluding a brief historical\u000asignificance, the scholar\u000adelved into the finer aspects of\u000akhyal singing, fulfilling all the\u000anecessary expectations of a\u000aconnoisseur, an academician\u000aand a performer.It was interesting to learn\u000ahow a stage performance may\u000abe advantageously founded on\u000asound theoretical background\u000awhen he illustratively brought\u000ahome the practical applications\u000aof the principles put\u000aforth in Sangeetha Ratnakara\u000aof Sharangadeva. The main\u000aobjective was to focus on the\u000apoints pertaining to the constituents\u000aof a good music,\u000acomponents of khyal and the\u000aconventional method of presenting\u000athat particular genre of\u000aHindustani music.The event facilitated a clear\u000ainsight into many musical\u000acomponents like pakad (catching\u000aphrase), uthav (overture),\u000aakaar- aalap, nomtom- aalap,\u000abol-alaap, bol-upaj (word-oriented\u000arhythmic pattern), taans\u000aof various dimensions, sthayi,\u000aantara and so on in relation to\u000aboth bada khyal and chota\u000akhyal.Realising the philosophy of\u000amusic, the accomplished singer,\u000awith his magisterial emotive\u000avoice, elaborated\u000aSadarang's "Abto Sunle" (badhakhyal)\u000aand "Gore Mukhso"\u000a(chotakhyal) in Bhimpalas.\u000aEmphasis was always on the\u000aimportance of a faithful delineation\u000aof the personality of the\u000araga under interpretation. The\u000arendition was marked by a\u000ameaningful depiction of the\u000alyrics with proper diction and\u000acompetence, be it a word or a\u000asentence (padartha and\u000avakyartha).Veerabhadrayya Hiremath\u000a(harmonium) and Bhimashankar\u000aBidanur accompanied Pandit\u000aNirodi.
