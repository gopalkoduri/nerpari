VUstad Amir Khan's intellectual and contemplative approach to Hindustani classical music evolved his own stylistic school which came to be known as the Indore gharana. His disciples like Amarnath, A. Kanan, Singh Bandhu and others assimilated this gayaki (singing style) which was a perfect blend of intellect and emotion, technique and temperament. The chastity of swara intonation and rich melodic elaboration with the &#8216;mer-khand' technique (also known as khand-meru) that strove to produce the varied permutations and combinations of a given set of notes are some of the remarkable features of this gayaki.Third generationIt was a pleasing assurance to witness the contemplative, soul-stirring and blissful music of Ustad Amir Khan as interpreted by the third generation of this glorious tradition when Naresh Malhotra performed at the Epicentre recently. Meticulously groomed over two decades in the true guru-shishya parampara by Pandit Tejpal Singh, the elder of the renowned Singh Bandhu, Naresh has mastered the subtleties and nuances of Indore gayaki in full measure. A highly talented exponent of this gharana, Naresh also holds an M.A. and M. Phil in Music and is an A-grade artiste of Akashavani and Doordarshan.Deep serenityHe opened his recital with Yaman, that most melodious and serene evening raga. As per the convention of this gharana, the bada khayal was set to vilambit (slow) Jhoomra tala. The development of the slow composition, &#8220;Ab kaise kariye&#8221;, was marked with deep serenity that saw meticulous and imaginative unfolding of the raga according to the khand-meru technique during the alap-barhat and bol-alap.The famous chhota khayal &#8220;Saanjh bhai udit bhaye jab nabh ke tare&#8221; set to drut Ek tala was sung with feeling, taking equal care of the poetic and melodic element of the lovely composition. The crystal clear sargam and aakar taans were sung with effortless ease in both the khayals.Immortalised by Ustad Amir Khan, raga Megh was the next choice of Naresh, who sang the famous composition &#8220;Garaj ghata ghan&#8221; set to Jhap tala in this monsoon raga. The characteristic treatment of Rishabh, and the meend from Komal Nishad to Pancham, especially in the lower octave, suited the gait, carriage and complexion of the lovely bandish. Naresh continued this raga with the famous tarana of Ustad Amir Khan set to drut Ek tala replete with the concluding Persian couplet.Hamasadhwani came next with the popular composition of Ustad Aman Ali Khan &#8212; who composed under the pseudonym &#8216;Amar'.Surprisingly in the well known bandish &#8220;Laagi lagan Sati-Pati san&#8221;, he sang &#8220;Sakhi-Pati instead of &#8220;Sati Pati&#8221; (which refers to Shiva the consort of Sati). Naresh opened it in quite a slow tempo of Teen tala unsuitable to the chanchal prakriti(lively quality) of this raga and later ascended to the desired tempo. He intended to conclude his recital with this, but on popular demand he had to oblige with a bhajan and concluded with a soulful rendering, based on raga Jhinjhoti, of a devotional pada by Paramanand Das.Sajjad Khan on the harmonium and Akhtar Hasan on the tabla gave him commendable support.LURE OF INDOREThe Indore gayaki is considered a perfect blend of intellect and emotion, technique and temperament.Chastity of swara intonation and rich melodic elaboration with the `merkhand' technique (also known as khand-meru), in which the singer produces varied permutations and combinations of a given set of notes, are some of its remarkable features.Ustad Amir Khan's intellectual and contemplative approach to Hindustani music evolved this stylistic school.His major disciples include Pandit Amarnath, A. Kanan, the Singh Bandhu
