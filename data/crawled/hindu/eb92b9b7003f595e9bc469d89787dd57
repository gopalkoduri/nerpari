VThere are several ways to relieve one of stress and tension that have become part of daily life these days. Spiritual activity is one of them.Singing bhajans in groups and chanting slokas are especially favoured.The Pondicherry-based Sri Vishnu Sahasranaama Parayana kuzhu or Sri Vishnu Sahasranaama Sath Sangam has been working in this direction for the past eight years.Every Sunday the members gather to chant Vishnu Sahasranaamam, an hour from 6.15 p.m.A source in the Sangam said that there has been an increase in the number of participants.The venue is either the residence of a participant or a marriage hall. The turn out includes both young and old.The Sangam was started in 1998 with forty families participating.Now the number had risen and keeps on increasing, the source said.
