VB. RAMADEVITHEME CONCERT: T. M. Krishna    Photo: S. Siva SaravananThis month's concert in the `Eppadi Paadinaro' series organised by Sri Krishna Sweets at the Pravachana Mandapam, Kodhandaramar Koil, Coimbatore, featured T. M. Krishna on the theme `Krishna Leela.' Commencing with the Begada varnam `Inthachalamu,' Krishna set the mood with  Andal's Thiruppavai, `Margazhiththingal.'Narayana Tirtha's `Aalokaye Rukmini Kalyana Gopalam' in Kambodi was majestic, especially during the neraval for the line `Dwaraka Mandape.'After the lovely composition by Dikshitar, `Balagopalam,' in Bhairavi describing the beauty of the divine child, he sang Swati Thirunal's composition, `Gopanandana Vararipu' after a compact alapana in `Bhushavali.'The beauty of Kedaragowla flowed in all its splendour when Krishna delineated it and his rendition of `Venuganaloluni' by Tyagaraja was perfect. He touched new heights during the neraval for `Vikasitha Pankaja Vadhanam' and the effect was highly enhanced by the imaginative and supportive accompanying artistes &#151;  V. L. Kumar (violin) and Poongulam Subramaniam (mridangam).AwesomeThe ashtapadi `Vadasiyathi Kinchidapi' (Jayadeva) portrayed `Viyoga Sringara' movingly. The RTP was the crowning jewel.After an elaborate alapana and a crisp tanam, he broke into the pallavi `Leela Manusha Vesha, Gamaneeya Sri Krishna,' which was set to Chathusrajathi jampa tala.T. M. Krishna proved his absolute mastery over the raga and the laya. The effect was awesome and thrilling. But, there were very few light songs to cater to the uninitiated. However, he sang some of the more popular ones such as Vyasaraja's `Krishna Nee Begane Baaro' in Yamuna Kalyani, Purandaradasa's `Jagadodhdharana' in Kapi and Narayana Tirtha's  `Madhava Maamava' in Neelambari.`Pachai Maamalai Pol Meni' the Paasuram by Thondaradippodiyazhwar as ragamalika virutham was enjoyable while, `Karpooram Naarumo' that followed it was full of devotion.Bottom Template Starts
