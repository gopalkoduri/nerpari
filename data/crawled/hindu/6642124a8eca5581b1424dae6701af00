VTTD&#8217;s appeal to composers and singers to take up unknown compositions of Annamacharya has had an effect, as young musicians are selecting untouched numbers of Annamacharya to render.Master Bhaskaruni Saicharan, a disciple of D.V.Mohanakrishna is one such youngster. He sought the help of composer Vinnakota Muralikrishna, known in the field of light music, to set music for Annamayya songs not rendered so far by anybody. It is said that Vinnakota has already set music to around hundred such new songs. Saicharan rendered dozen new songs at Thyagaraya Gana Sabha&#8217;s mini hall recently to a good gathering of music lovers.The selection was good as it had a mix of Annamayyakirtanaswritten for different occasions. They includedSringarakirtanasand devotional numbers visualising Lord Venkateswara as Rama, Krishna and in other avataras. It started withMelukonavein Bowli, an early morning prayer appealing the lord to wake up. The next number was asringarasongVaddu Vaddu Vegiralu Vanitha Thonuin Behag.Nityanandain Chakravakam,Kalada Intati Daatain Abheri andAragimpavoin Madhyamavati were taken up next.The best song in the entire lot wasRamudide Lokabhiramudithaduaptly set in Arabhi and the unique feature was that the entire Ramayana was narrated in just eight lines! Saicharan is a serious student of Carnatic music and its influence was found in the rendition of some songs. He is gifted with sonorous voice that can traverse though briskgamakasand hence his presentation was soothing. The tired voice towards the end was the result of fever he was suffering from, as revealed by composer Muralikrishna. The compositions being new there was need to detail thesahityapart of some of the songs.For sure Saicharan is a young man of great promise. He was accompanied by Guruprasad on keyboard and Pandu on tabla. The programme was held under the auspices of a cultural organisation named &#8216;Madhuram&#8217; which marked its fifth anniversary with this programme.
