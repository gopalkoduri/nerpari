VVyasa Vidya Peeta in association with Academy of Music and Gayana Samaja had recently organised a &#8220;Bhajan-Sandhya&#8221; concert of the Hindustani classical vocalist Pandit Jasraj. Although he is now an octogenarian, Pandit Jasraj's musical exuberance showed no signs of exhaustion, flowing with its characteristic youthful verve and lyrical abandon.A consummate khayal artiste, Jasraj has also given a substantial accent to devotional music. He commenced his recital with his invocation &#8220;Om Shri Anant Hari Narayan&#8221; in the manner of a chant that was followed by his unmetered alap using the sloka &#8220;Mangalam Bhagawan Vishnu&#8230;&#8221; in the raag Behag before he took up the beautiful Devi Stuti, a Sanskrit composition composed by Gurumata Amma modelled on the &#8220;Lalita Sahasranama&#8221;.Jasraj captivated the audience with his mellifluous and clear enunciation of the Sanskrit composition &#8220;Charu Roopa, Charu Hasa Chandike&#8230;&#8221;in Behag set to teental. The emotional and semantic content of the composition was alluringly accentuated and embellished with beautiful meends that resonated so vibrantly in his disciple, the young maestro Vidwan Shashank's flute accompaniment. Panditji's unique sargams elicited standing ovation from the audience. The excellent accompanying artistes comprising Mukund Petkar on the harmonium, Ram Kumar Mishra on the tabla and Palgun on the mrudanga imparted an ethereal dimension to his masterful rendition of this composition.This was followed by an Ektal composition &#8220;Jaya Jaya Sri Durge&#8221; in the majestic midnight melody raag Darbari, a &#8216;sampoorna raga' that deploys all the seven notes in its aroha and avaroha. Jasraj ingeniously developed this devotional composition like a madhyalaya khayal by alap in the cyclic avartans elaborated appealingly in the lower and higher registers and a volley of fast sargams, varieties of ornate taans, swift ascents and descents down the raag scale.Like his concert favourites &#8220;Govinda Damodara Madhav Yeti&#8221; in Nat Bhairav, &#8220;Kasturi Tilakam&#8221; in Madhuvanti and &#8220;Brija Vasantam Navneet Choram&#8221; in raag Kafi, the devotional composition in Darbari also bedazzled the audience. From Darbari, Jasraj moved to another raga of the Darbari Kanada family, raag Adana. Listening to his rendition of the masterpiece &#8220;Mata Kalika&#8221; penned by his poet-patron Maharaja Jaswantsingh was a transcendental experience. Another commendable feature was the exemplary sense of clarity and effectiveness with which Jasraj highlighted the poetic content of the composition. A truly enchanting enunciation of this composition was marked by an inexhaustible combination of sargams, which affirmed his improvisational versatility.Panditji's exquisite rendition of another devotional composition &#8220;Govindam Gokulanandam&#8230;&#8221; in raga Bhimpalas received a thunderous applause from the audience.
