VGUDIPOODI SRIHARIPlayback singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam made a critical analysis of the current scenario in Telugu cinema, emphasising that "Anyone with a little musical sense can render a song after listening four times, since the recording system uses software to correct mistakes inlaya, shrutiand literary content." He was speaking after giving a performance at Ravindra Bharati. The event was organised by Kinnera Art theatre and Nada Vinodini.He said, "Music has become so loud that it has become tough to comprehend the lyrics.." He then hastened to explain that he was critical not because he was singing only select songs nowadays but because the changes are "simply horrible".In course of the evening, Balu and other singers sang songs composed by Kalaga Krishna Mohan of All India Radio. Child artiste Chaitra, teenager Pranavi, and other singers like Ramachari, Vinod Babu, Partha Sarathi and Surekha Murthy came up with good performances. Most of these melodies were part of two CDs, by playback singer S. Janaki.  Kalaga Krishnamohan's song was rich in lyrical content and music. He was supported on the instrumental by Saroja Ganapati.  .Bottom Template Starts
