Ramana Murty on the violin and Srinivas Sharma on the Mridangam and T.P. Balu on the ghatam presented a refreshing recital. The talented youth has the passion and zeal to deliver but seldom such talents gets opportunity. Pratha began with the noted Natakuranji varnam. Ranganadhude in sowrastra of Ponnayya Pillai was good.Harikhambhoji was the next to come for Thyagaraja's Yentaraneetana with punching pace .Arabhi was detailed for a clean expression of the ragam for Chuthamurare with speedy swaram. Kharahapriya was the next ragam and it came with the good sangathis and prakkalanilabadi in misra chapu. Paripalinchumani in Sudda Saveri in Khanda Chapu was a fast number and was well executed.Kalyani was the key attraction of the day and Pratha did well to bring in the Ragabhavam and he chose to sing Yetavuna Ra In Adi of Thyagaraja was a good treat. Ramanmurty supported well on the violin with a good flow and Sharma did extremely well on the Mridangam. The concert concluded with Thyagaraja Utsavasampradaya Krithi in Pantuvarali and finally with Lalgudi Thillana in Mand. Over all the artiste showed good promise and has delivered his recital with good quality inputs.
