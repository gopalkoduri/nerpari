VOne has often seen members of the audience walking out in the middle of a concert, in full view of the artistes on stage and unmindful of their feelings. But this was a different scene altogether. The artiste was presenting an outstanding alap of the raga Shankarabharanam. His sancharam around the note  Gandhara in the upper octave was scintillating. Suddenly, there  was a power breakdown  and the hall&#8217;s backup system  refused to work. As a result the hall plunged into darkness. But the artiste  sang on.He  took up &#8220;Swararagasudha&#8221; and  his presentation of this composition of Tyagaraja  brimmed over with emotion, harnessing the power of the lyrics as well as the notes of the raga. A few candles  were lit.  The mike system  was somehow restored. The artiste proceeded to present niraval of the phrase &#8220;Mooladharaka nadamerukuta&#8221; and swaraprastaras  flowed  richly.  More than half-an-hour had elapsed since the power broke down and it  was quite hot inside the hall at Sree Subha Siddhi Vinayaka Mandir, Mayur Vihar. It would have been a good excuse for  listeners to disappear from the scene. But N. Vijay Shiva&#8217;s Carnatic vocal recital the other day,  under the aegis of Naadhabrahmam, kept the rasikas spellbound and hardly anyone moved. Such was the quality of  his recital.Earlier, Vijay Shiva presented Tyagaraja&#8217;s  &#8220;Maragadamanivarna&#8221; in  raga Varali. Apart from presenting a fine sketch of the raga, Vijay Shiva took up for niraval a phrase from the charanam of the composition. Similarly, Shyama Sastri&#8217;s &#8220;Sankari Samkuru&#8221; in the raga Saveri underwent fine treatment. Mullaivasal G. Chandramouli on the violin and A.S. Ranganathan on the mridangam provided good support.  This candlelight concert of Vijay Shiva will linger long in the hearts of  Delhi rasikas.On the other hand, there were lots of expectations from Neyveli R. Santhanagopalan, who performed on the opening day of the  eight-day  festival titled the Tamil New Year &amp; Sri Rama Navami Music Festival. Sadly, Santhanagopalan fell short of expectations. He spent  more time than  was required for swaraprastaras. For every song  he presented till the tani avartanam session, including the  Mohana raga varnam at the beginning, Santhanagopalan suffixed  a detailed bout of swaraprastaras. One felt that adequate justice was not given to actual song presentation. The saving grace in this concert was Vittal Ramamurthy&#8217;s violin accompaniment. Mannargudi N. Subramanian, the editor of the Chennai-based music magazine Naadhabrahmam, provided mridangam support.An impressive performance by Delhi&#8217;s  K. Vageesh the following day kindled the spirits of  listeners and changed the scenario. Vageesh took up some rare ragas like Rishabhapriya (62nd melakarta) and Suddha Desi and presented fine sketches of these ragas. &#8220;Ramachandra bhavayami&#8221; a slightly fast tempo composition in the raga Vasanta was lively. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Upacharamulanu&#8221;, the main item of his recital, was characterised by a fine alap bringing out the raga bhava  and enjoyable niraval and swaraprastaras towards the end.It is heartening to see the Chennai-based organisation conducting this music festival in the Capital. Mayur Vihar South Indian Association and Sree Subbha Siddhi Vinayaka Mandir society were associated in this festival and provided the local support.
