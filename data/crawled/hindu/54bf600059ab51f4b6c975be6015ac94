VOn Sunday last at the Parthasarathy Swami Sabha, Vasundhara Rajagopal rendered Paasurappadi Ramayanam giving the lines musical shape &#8212; she had roped in 33 ragas for the purpose &#8212; with Velukkudi Krishnan coming up with appropriate comments.The Azhwars have written extensively on the vibhava and archa forms of the Lord. Tirumangai Azhvar, for example, sums up the Dasavatara in the verse, &#8220;Meenodaamai, kezhal ari kuralaai...&#8221; Of the ten avataras, Rama and Krishna are considered complete (poorna) avataras. References to Rama lie scattered through the prabandhas, making it difficult for a reader to zero in on them. Pasurappadi Ramayanam is therefore a boon to Rama Bhaktas.Peria Vachan Pillai begins with the words from Tirumangai Azhwar&#8217;s Peria Tirumozhi &#8212; &#8216;Tirumadandai Manmadandai iru paalum tigazha&#8230;&#8217;  He (Rama) came as the scion of the Surya vamsam &#8212;Venkadiron kulathukkor vilakkaai. Peria Vachan Pillai has added the wordsnadanduto the words from the Divya Prabandham.It might be apt to recall  an article of D. Ramaswamy Iyengar. While writing about the Tiruneermalai temple, he says that the &#8220;Nadandaaan&#8221; in Tirumangai Azhwar&#8217;s pasuram relating to that temple could not be a reference to Trivikrama, but instead pointed to  Rama. After all, Trivikrama took three giant steps, and that was it. But Rama walked miles and miles in the forest.Velukkudi Swami spoke of how the Lord at Tirukkannamangai redeemed his promise to Tirumangai Azhwar, when the latter was born as Nampillai under the star Karthikai, in the month of Karthikai. The Lord himself appeared as Peria Vachan Pillai in the month of Avani under the star Rohini, and studied under Nampillai.Why is Sundara Kandam so called? According to Velukkudi Swami  because Sita, Rama, Hanuman and the other principal characters in it are beautiful, and because we become beautiful too when we read it!Velukkudi Swami&#8217;s lecture was brilliant, with many references to other works. His  erudite and absorbing comments with a dash of humour, left one yearning for more.It was an admirable effort on the part of Vasundhara. &#8220;I sang the Rama Nataka kritis at the TTD centre, T. Nagar. Srinivasan of the centre then suggested that I should set to tune the Pasurappadi Ramayanam too and gave me the text. I then asked M.V.Anantapadmanabhachariar to explain the work to me,&#8221; said Vasundara.&#8220;Getting the meter to fit into a tune was difficult. I had to ensure that the beauty of the sahityam was highlighted. I felt it would be ideal to have a lec-dem. So I requested Velukkudi Swami to talk on the Pasurappadi Ramayanam.&#8221; One hopes she will include portions of the &#8216;Pasurappadi Ramayanam&#8217; in her regular concerts.Vasundhara was accompanied by Usha Rajagopalan on the violin, Nellai Balaji on the mridangam, and Madippakkam Murali on the ghatam. Usha&#8217;s rendering, especially of ragas Varali, Kedaragowla, Saveri and Sahana, was very good. A Thanjavur painting of Rama Pattabhishekam on the dais added an artistic touch to the programme.
