VThe select listeners were treated to an orthodox vocal rendition sans frills. It was straight with grounded manodharma with the right mix of classicality and emotive quality. Veteran guru Komanduri Seshadri captured the attention of all the music enthusiasts gathered at the chamber concert with his all-enveloping alapana, striking swarakalpana and evocative style of singing. In a word, he did full justice to the raga, bhava and tala facets without having to forfeit either. Having said this much, a brief scan of the recital under the aegis of Nada Bharathi: a melodic alapana set the tone for Sahana. The lucidity of the lyrics &#8216;Sari evvare maa Janaki..' the pun intended and the musician making use of his tonal variation to further enhance this quality was indeed laudable. The improvisation spun into extensive pattern embellishing the Sahana in all its loveliness.It is definitely not commonplace to hear a Dikshitar being elaborated with finesse and confidence. It is to the credit of the vocalist that Kanjadalayatakshi&#8230; in Kamala Manohari was reeled out with an ease and elegance that comes with experience and expertise. The neraval at the line &#8216;raaka shashi vadane..' exhibited a flair for stylisation. Exhaustive swarakalpana bore testimony to his mastery over a tough kriti. Srinivas Gopalan on the mridangam and Komanduri Ananthashouri Rajan on the violin complimented the rendition with their deft handling.While the general trend in a concert is to launch into a vivid ragalapana scaling the intrinsic nuances of the particular raga, with Komuduri Seshadri it is all this and much more. He displays a flair for emerging from an exhaustive alapana into the kriti proper without providing for that &#8216;pause' which sets him apart from the rest of his ilk. And that is his USP. Though for the most part, the rendition was in low tones, the command was discernable. Heccharikaga&#8230; in Yadukula Khambhoji was sweet which was evident in both form and content.The alapana for Thodi kriti Sarasijanabha murare&#8230; encompassed the raga in all its brilliance till it surged into the kriti proper with a highly structured manodharma in keeping with the richness of Thodi. The soft neraval for muravaari &#8230; spoke eloquent. Handling the raga in his inimitable way, Komunduri made for an evening of genuine Carnatic music
