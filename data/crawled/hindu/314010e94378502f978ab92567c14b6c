VManjari Asnara Kelkar is a disciple of Pandit Madhusudhan Kanatkar, who in turn was the disciple of the late Ustad Burji Khan, a son of Ustad Alladiya Khan. Manjari&#8217;s recital was a morning session concert at the India International Centre.This was a good change to enable the lovers of classical music to listen to the ragas of the morning. In spite of the inclement weather conditions, the number in the audience gradually became quite large.One would have liked the compere to be a bit more precise and allow the artiste to commence her recital with a raga of her own choice and avoid asking her to render the raga Mian-ki-Todi.It was amusing to hear him say that this particular  raga was not much popular with the Jaipur-Atrauli musicians. The raga Mian-ki-Todi is one of the several ragas created by the legendary Mian Tansen. No musician worth his salt would refrain from learning this exquisite melody and  mastering it to the best of his or her abilities.Most musicians come to the concert platform with a pre-planned concept of the items to be rendered, particularly the opening number. As such,  Mishra&#8217;s request could have been made later on, but certainly not before the commencement of the recital. Kudos to Manjari for agreeing to the compere&#8217;s request and rendering  Mian-ki-Todi with full gusto and much aplomb.The Khayal composition &#8220;Raj karo yaa nagari men&#8221; set to a slow tempo  Teen tala was elaborated with intense melodic appeal and reposefulness. The &#8216;alap-badhat&#8217; executed with the raga&#8217;s format well handled was a treat. There were scores of intricate taan phrasings released with utmost ease and musicianship of a very high level. According to Manjari, this particular composition was a specialty of her gharana. The fast  Teen tala composition &#8220;Angiyaan bheej gayee mori&#8221; delighted for the liltingly executed variations and intricate taan sequences.Mishra made yet another request to Manjari to render  raga Bhatiar to which she partly agreed by rendering the raga Sawani Bhatiar, which took away the aridness that invariably sounds in  Bhatiar.The madhya  Teen tala composition &#8220;Sanwariya hum se karo naa gurar&#8221; and the fast  Ek tala piece &#8220;Tum bin kachhu naa suhaaye&#8221; were rendered with  a feel for the lyrics besides the exquisite presentation of the intelligently blended ragas Sawani and Bhatiar. Incidentally, Ustad Alladiya Khan was well known for his blending of two or more  ragas to give form to a large number of newly created melodies.Manjari&#8217;s singing of the tappa in Raga Kafi (&#8220;Ho Mian jaane wale&#8221;) failed to  achieve the desired appeal with which the Gwalior musicians, particularly  the late Krishnarao Shankar Pandit, sang it. She however enthralled with her renderings in the colourful melody of raga Jaunpuri-Bahar with a slow  Teen tala composition &#8220;Eri maayee piya&#8221; followed  by a fast  Teen tala piece &#8220;Saghan ghana laage&#8221;.Her blending of the ragas Jaunpuri and Bahar was a delight to the ears. But what delighted most was her able interplay between the notes Suddha and Komal Dhaivat, and the Dhaivats and the two Nishadhs.Her brief rendering in raga Gaud Sarang with a madhya Teen tala piece &#8220;Ve yaar nazar nahi aaonda&#8221; was a befitting one, indicating the phasing out of the morning hours and beginning of noontime.The bhajan in raga Bhairavi, &#8220;Anaathan ke naath tu Yadunath&#8221;, came as a befitting finale to her recital  since it was sung with deep devotional fervour.She had commendable support  from Vinay Mishra (harmonium), Vinod Lele (tabla), Alka and Seema (tanpuras).
