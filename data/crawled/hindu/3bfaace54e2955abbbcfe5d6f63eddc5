VJust imagine visiting an authentic exhibition of traditional Indian arts and crafts and watching a couple of veterans belonging to the eldest surviving generation of jewellers taking a handful of sparkling and colourful gems, framing them with gold a\u000and setting or stringing them together into beautiful bracelets and necklaces &#8212; what a fascinating experience it would be!That was precisely how one felt when hearing a brief concert of Carnatic music which followed the inaugural session of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan&#8217;s Golden Jubilee celebrations in the Bhavan&#8217;s excellent auditorium last Sunday evening. And the seasoned craftsmen were vocalist Balamuralikrishna and mridangam maestro T.V. Gopalakrishnan.&#8216;Naada-tanum anisam, Sankaram Namaami; may manasaa sirasaa...&#8217; (To Sankara, the embodiment of sound, I pray, with mind and body) &#8212; an extremely tranquil tone was set up for the whole concert by the leisurely and measured way in which the twin masters began the concert with the above lines of Tyagaraja&#8217;s Sanskrit song in the raga Chittaranjani &#8212; the lyrics being articulated with such crystal clarity that each word glowed like a jewel, as did each note of the melody and every beat of the rhythm.And Dikshitar&#8217;s kriti &#8216;Aananda amrita Aakarshini&#8217; in the raga Amritavarshini reinforced this serene setting.Then there was an amazing exploration of Thodi which captured many elusive and unfamiliar nuances of the frequently rendered raga and held a large and adoring audience spellbound. The song &#8212; Balamurali&#8217;s own composition &#8216;Sudhaa Nidhe, Maamava, Sadaa Dayaa...&#8217; &#8212; and the improvised swara sequences effectively sustained this lovely vision. In the brief and powerful percussion solo, TVG&#8217;s mridangam had the resonance of temple bells.Although the dominant mode of the music was reposeful, it did not prevent the singer from setting out on occasional spells of soaring and animation. But somehow these didn&#8217;t constitute a distraction, but were well balanced and actually added some attractive colours. And an aggressive Ragamalika Tillana composed by Balamurali in five ragas and varying rhythmic patterns provided a lively spell. The concert ended as it began, on a tranquil note, with the beautiful lyrics of the Telugu song &#8216;Eeswara akgnya Emo Teliyadu...&#8217; in Sindu Bhairavi, composed by Mallekonda Ramadas. And the alapana of the raga which preceded the song was as exquisite and exotic as the Thodi which had figured in the concert earlier.If Balamurali and TVG were the veteran craftsmen who assembled these wonderful pieces of jewellery, what was the role played by the young and promising violinist S. Varadarajan on this memorable occasion? Very wisely he adopted a low profile and merely echoed the singer&#8217;s voice; but in the process, he raised his own excellence to a very high level, and his violin became a mirror reflecting and multiplying the sparkling colours of the ornaments. This performance is surely an important landmark in Varadarajan&#8217;s steady progress as a violinist.The most striking impression emerging at the end of the concert was that there&#8217;s a unique chemistry between Balamurali and TVG, which mutually raises their own levels of habitual excellence. One hopes that they will perform together more frequently in the future, and that some enterprising organisers or institution will set up a project for systematically arranging and recording such encounters and preserve these veterans&#8217; combined vision for posterity. If such a project can be realised only by calling for public subscription, this critic will be glad to rush in with the first application!
