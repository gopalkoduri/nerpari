VProbably performing for the first time at the India Habitat Centre&#8217;s HCL Concert Series, the young  vocalist Ruchira Kale succeeded in establishing an instant rapport with her large audience from the  word go. She spoke and performed with utmost confidence and melodic charms.She cast a  spellover the entire evening. Her skill and talent  can be attributed to her thorough grounding from her learned teachers, such as her fatherDilip Kale, Alkadeo Marulkar of the Atrauli-Jaipur gharana, Pandit Ulhas Kashalkar, a maestro of the Agra-Gwalior gharanas and finally, Vidushi Girija Devi, the doyenne of Banaras Thumri,  Chaiti, etc. Having earned an ITC Sangeet Research Academy scholarship, she had the  privilege of staying on campus and studying  under  learned teachers as per the age-old guru-shishya parampara.One does appreciate Ruchira&#8217;s excellent planning for the recital which she commenced with a charmingly rendered Khayal composition from the rich repertoire of Gwalior&#8217;s masterpieces. &#8220;Mati Maalainyaa&#8221;, in raga Kamod, a major raga of the Kalyan thaat,  set to the slow and intricate  14-beat Jhumra tala It was rendered with utmost authenticity in  the lyrics and the form of the raga.Her further exposition of the lyrics was leisurely done but at the same time keeping the raga&#8217;s form and also its lyrical structure absolutely intact. The prominent features of the Gwalior idiom were well adhered to. The fast Teen tala composition &#8220;Kaare jaane naa doongi eri mayee, apne balam ko&#8221;, also a Gwalior masterpiece, was a delight when handled by Ruchira with her liltingly deployed variations and quite a few bold and sweepingsapaat taansthat ran into the upper octaves with utmost ease. One was  impressed with her good lungpower and the compass of her vocal range.Ruchira next presented a charmingly rendered composition by the late Jitendra Abhisheki in raga Bageshwari. Set to the 16-beat mid-tempo time-cycle of Teen tala, the song &#8220;Naa daaro rang mo pe&#8221; seemed to be a melodic description of the festival of colours, Holi. It was set to an enchanting melody to which Ruchira added her melodic expertise. So also was the fast Teen tala piece &#8220;Veg veg aao&#8221; (&#8220;Come very fast&#8221;), sung with lively variations.Her last but one presentation was Alkadeo Marurkar&#8217;s piece in the morning raga Sohni which Ruchira rendered with utmost feeling and melodic effects. The ragamala variations were deployed with noble effect. The madhya Teen tala composition &#8220;Kare barajori Hori ke bahaane&#8221; was tagged with pleasing variations.Ruchira provided a befitting finale to her delightful renderings o with a  colourful thumri of Girija Devi in Mishra Khamaj, &#8220;Rang daroongi saanwariya Nand ke laalan par&#8221;.Ruchira had excellent accompaniment on the harmonium by Paramita Mukherjee and on the tabla by Vinod Lele.
