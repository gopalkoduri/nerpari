VG. SWAMINATHANIn  fast changing Chennai,  certain places  continue to remain untouched.  Mylapore Srinivasa Sastri Hall is one such landmark. The rickety steel chairs, the assorted slow running fans and the makeshift dais with jamakkalam seem to say that time has indeed stood still here. The place sure needs some attention, including the impressive oil portrait of Srinivasa Sastri. Perhaps the Hall can be given a facelift retaining its old world charm.The 11th  anniversary  of Balaganamruthum (Chennai) and Karnataka College of Percussion (Bangalore), entitled `Monsoon Marvel,' featured a violin duet of Kanyakumari and her disciple Sanjeev at  the inaugural concert held at Sastri Hall. One gets the feeling that Kanyakumari tries to bridge the tradition with popularity so that her music reaches a wider circle of audience. In her performance, she pleased the audience with an esoteric bliss of classical idiom, though  with the inclusion of dazzling manoeuvres.The three ragas that prominently figured in the programme &#151;  Kalyanavasantham (the not so popular `Sri Venkatesam' of Dikshitar),  Ritigowla (`Janani Ninnuvina') and  Kapi (`Inta Sowkya') &#151;  carried brilliant  as well as brash patches: Kapi and Ritigowla with their quaint notes exuded a lot of charm as the instrumentalists always enjoy an edge over vocalists in searching, reaching and reproducing notes to  perfection. Kanyakumari was simply excellent in blending the limpid notes of Kapi with several enticing phrases.  But the weakness to throw frisky bits here and there, those exclusive for instrumental pranks, sometimes puts one off.Deep-rooted classicism`Inta Sowkya'  of Tyagaraja came with deep-rooted classicism appended with  cleverly connected kalpanaswaras shared very softly by Sanjeev. Sanjeev's early prelude in the Ritigowlaalapana was marked by its touching melody. So was their combined presentation of the oeuvre `Janani Ninnu Vina' of Subbaraya Sastri. `Pranamamyaham' in Gowlai and the fast set `Naa Jeevathara' in Bilahari provided an energetic start. The seldom-heard `Maaye Twam Yahi' of Dikshitar in Tarangini was effectively portrayed. The special padding at the right places with the right landings by mridangist Satish Kumar in this kriti, made  a good impact. Satish Kumar's slightly exuberant but matching rhythm with Shree Sundar Kumar on the kanjira was commendable. Their tani avartanam was engaging with multiple layers of long and short patterns of beat.Bottom Template Starts
