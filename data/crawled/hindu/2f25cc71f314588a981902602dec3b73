VVols 1-5 and Vols 6-10, 5-CD pack each.RPG; Rs. 545 each.Some things never go out of fashion. Like Hindi film songs from the golden era of the 1940s, 1950s and the 1960s. And who better than the unmistakable voice of Ameen Sayani to re-introduce those hits all over again to a new generation!Yes, this is the same Sayani of &#8216;Binaca (later Cibaca) Geetmala&#8217; fame, whose words &#8216;Behanon aur Bhaiyon&#8217; meant it was melody time for music lovers across the globe who would be glued to Radio Ceylon on Wednesday evenings at 8 p.m. Sayani, who finds a place in the Limca Book of Records for hosting over 54,000 radio shows and doing voice-overs for 19,000 ads, is back with two five-CD packs of all those songs which were featured on his much-admired radio show.&#8216;Geetmala Ki Chhaon Mein&#8217; is truly a collector&#8217;s delight. Each pack presents five volumes and each CD has about 10-15 songs, some of which have become cult classics. LikeMan dole(Nagin), which topped the charts for two years!This unique collection also contains snatches of interviews with legends including Raj Kapoor (he talks about Nargis), Kishore Kumar, Asha Bhonsle, Jagdeep and Mehmood.SAVITHA GAUTAM
