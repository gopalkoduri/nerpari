VThe current-day Carnatic music scenario consists of more vocalists, while the numbers of flute players and veena artists is but a handful.  It is gratifying under these circumstances to listen to a good instrumental concert by senior flautist Dr. N. \u000aRamani , whose concert held in 2007, has been brought out as a DVD by Shakthi Extratainment P Ltd.Ramani has, throughout his career, adhered to classical values.  This album opens with the Khamboji ata tala varnam &#8216;Sarasijanaba&#8217; rendered in speeds with tisra playing being resorted to in the charanam, which used to be done by his mentor, the inimitable Flute Mali. Three kritis of Tyagaraja follow in quick succession with just the songs being played without any solfa passages. &#8216;Teradiyaka&#8217; (Gowlipantu), &#8216;Chinnanadena&#8217; (Kalanidhi) and &#8216;Sujanajeevana&#8217; (Kamas) are the chosen compositions. The Navarasa Kannada kriti &#8216;Ninnuvina&#8217; of Tyagaraja has been a favourite with instrumentalists and Ramani&#8217;s rendering is fast-paced and engaging. &#8216;Marivere&#8217; (Shanmukhapriya) of Patnam Subramania Iyer is played after just a single phrase of the melody, which is surprising. This could probably have been due to time constraint. As in the earlier songs, the flautist avoids kalpanaswaras for this song too.Khamboji is the only raga which has been taken up for vinyasa. The meaningful phrases in the lower octave are soothing to listen to. The violinist S.D. Sridhar&#8217;s essay of the raga is passable. He tends to go out of sruti during the closing phrases of his raga exposition.Ramani&#8217;s weighty rendering of &#8216;Evarimata&#8217; reflects a good patanthara of the song. Sans neraval, kalpanaswaras are played at the customary &#8216;Bhaktha Para&#8217; at the charanam segment of the song. A couple of avarthas of tisra kuraippu feature during the course of the swara playing coupled with the chatusra nadai ones. This exercise is totally professional and flawless. The violinist resorts to an ungrammatical usage of GRSN RSND during his swara replies in Khamboji.The brief tani avarthanam by R. Ramesh on the mridangam and E. M. Subramanyam on the ghatam are precise and to the point. Their support for the kriti renditions is anticipatory and raises the tempo of the concert.The perennial favourite &#8216;Chinnanchiru Kiliye&#8217; (Ragamalika- Subramania Bharati), a javali in Kedaragowlai (&#8216;Era Tagunatara&#8217;) and the Madhyamavathi kriti of Papanasam Sivan &#8216;Karpagame&#8217; are the closing numbers of this album.Dr N. Ramani: Shakti bani series; Shakthi Extratainment P Ltd; MRP Rs. 70.
