VA thematic concert on  an instrument sounds challenging.  For Carnatic violinist M. Narmadha, this challenge came in the form of the theme &#8216;Shiva-Shakti&#8217; when she performed at Sree Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha&#8217;s festival &#8216;Bhakti Pravaham&#8217;. Through what is called the &#8216;Parur-MSG&#8217; style, Narmadha rose to the occasion, bringing  out well the sahitya bhava  or poetic content of the songs on Lord Shiva and Goddess Shakti selected from various composers.  Her violin recital demonstrated the relevance of thematic concerts even to instrumental recitals.Though she spoke very little about the compositions during  the recital,  her eloquent violin made up for it.While presenting Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Nadatanumanisam&#8221; in the raga Chittaranjani, Narmadha&#8217;s brief swaraprastaras were crisp and lively. She handled well Gopalakrishna Bharathi&#8217;s composition &#8220;Sabhapatikku&#8221; in raga Abhogi and brought out the complete essence of this raga even in the brief alapana that she presented. Narmadha&#8217;s skills  on the violin, especially the bowing technique, and the consequent tonal richness, contributed to her success in this thematic concert. Neelakanta Sivan&#8217;s &#8220;Anandanatamaduvar&#8221; in  raga Poorvi Kalyani and Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8220;Devi neeyetunai&#8221; in Keeravani underwent detailed presentations.Apart from presenting fine sketches of these ragas, Narmadha&#8217;s creative skills  soared when she handled the other improvisation techniques &#8212; namely, neraval and kalpana swaras. A. S. Ranganathan on the mridangam and A.S. Krishnan on the morsing provided good support to Narmadha.Though their tani avartanam in Adi tala was brief, it was captivating.In another concert in this festival, 23-year-old Abhishek Raghuram presented a memorable vocal recital on the same theme (Shiva-Shakthi). T.M. Krishna was the scheduled artiste, but since Krishna could not make it due to indisposition, young Abhishek sang in his place.  It was a splendid performance in which he left no scope for any disappointment to rasikas.The very first piece that Abhishek presented, the navaraga varnam in Adi tala was very impressive. G.N. Balasubramanian&#8217;s composition &#8220;Nattaibaya varamu&#8221; in raga Nataikuranji, too was very impressive. In the alap, Abhishek presented a fine sketch of this raga. The neraval and swaraprastaras  flowed with rich creativity.Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s composition &#8220;Pirava varam tharum&#8221; in raga Latangi, particularly the fast paced swaraprastaras, kept the  proceedings lively. While presenting yet another Tamil composition &#8220;Kanavendamo&#8221; in raga Sriranjani, Abhishek brought out the emotive contents of the lyrics.Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s composition &#8220;Akshayalinga&#8221; in raga Shankarabharanam underwent a detailed elaboration Abhishek delineated the raga in stages and brought the essence of the  raga to the fore. The neraval and swaraprastaras that came later  revealed his manodharma.Vittal Ramamurthy on the violin, J. Vaidhyanathan on the mridangam and H. Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam contributed remarkably to the concert. While Ramamurthy&#8217;s sketches of ragas Nattaikurinji and Shankarabharanam were delightful, Vaidhyanathan and Sivaramakrishnan played a riveting tani avartanam in Mishra Chapu tala.
