VA vocal recital by Rekha Harinath, accompanied by Dr.R. Nataraj Murthy (violin), C. Cheluvaraj (mridanga), and N. Guru Murthy (ghata), was organised by the Rajamahal Vilas Sangeetha Sabha, Bangalore, on Sunday.The concert began with &#8220;Sarasijanabha&#8221;, the ata thala varna in Kamboji, rendered in two speeds, followed by a lilting sketch of Hamsadhwani, &#8220;Vathapi Ganapathim Bhajeham&#8221; the classic Dikshitar krithi in adi thala, sung with due emphasis on its literary and musical merits, and a few avartanas of kalpana swaras. &#8220;Anupama Gunambudhi&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi set to Athana raga and khanda chapu thala was also embellished with a modicum of kalpana swaras at the charana line beginning &#8220;Rajakula Kalasabdhi&#8221;. Annamacharya&#8217;s &#8220;Sriman Narayana&#8221; in Bhouli, which followed, was notable for the pronounced accent on the devotional content of the lyrics.Amrithavarshini was next taken up for a meticulous expansion that highlighted all the notes of its pentatonic scale, ranging from the mandra sthayi panchama to the tara sthayi panchama in a series of mellifluous phrases. Muthaiah Bhagavathar&#8217;s composition &#8220;Sudhamayi Sudhanidhe&#8221; set to rupaka tala was supplemented with a neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Sarasijaksha Jaganmohini&#8221;, attesting to ease of articulation and technical skill. While &#8220;Annapoorne Vishalakshi&#8221;, the Dikshitar krithi in Sama raga and aditala proved to be an excellent pick, the slightly accelerated pace of the presentation, however, ran counter to the mellow meditative quality inherent in both raga and kriti.The main raga of the evening, Madhyamavathi, was elaborated in detail, with the methodical development through the three octaves incorporating key sancharas based on a judicious blend of both weighty gamakas and fast bhrigas at appropriate junctures. &#8220;Palinchu Kamakashi&#8221;, the celebrated Shyama Shastri krithi in adi thala, featured a neatly structured neraval and kalpana swaras replete with spontaneous rhythmic patterns at &#8220;Kanthamaguperu&#8221;, imparting a traditional and heavily classical flavour to the concert as a whole. While the efforts of the vocalist were heightened by the faithful and prompt responses and support from the violinist, the ensuing thani avarthana of commensurate length and complexity demonstrated the expertise and dexterity of the percussionists.Among the concluding items were Purandaradasa&#8217;s &#8220;Jagadoddharana&#8221; in Kapi and Swathi Thirunal&#8217;s thillana in Dhanasri.The artiste&#8217;s commitment and her choice of well known krithis in familiar ragas, many of which are perennial favourites with music lovers, combined with the dedication and sense of propriety of the accompanying artistes, contributed in no small measure to the success of the concert.
