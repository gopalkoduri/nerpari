VChamber Music, which organises musical recitals by youngsters for an hour  and a full-fledged concert by seasoned artistes every last Sunday in the Bharateeya Samskruthi Bhavan, featured veena and violin recitals last month.Upcoming artiste Kasturi Kamaladeepthi with S. Janardhana Rao on mridangam  and M. Srinivasa Narasimha Murty  on violin along with Pantula Rama also on violin and K. Gnananandam on mridangam rendered the recitals.Deft handling of the instrument, rendering ofSudhamayi(amrithavarshini) and elaboration ofMaajanakimarked the recital by Deepthi on veena.Gnananandam&#8217;s tani was knowledgeable. M.S.N. Murty credited with participation either by way of accompanying or rendering solo on violin by choice in many a concert organised for broadcast by AIR and telecast by Doordarshan, got off to an absorbing start withSri Mahaganapathim(gowla). Sustaining the tenor playingSeethapathe(khamas) adorned with brief but beautiful aalapana and swaram, he went in for exquisite elaboration ofSri Satyanaraya\u000ana(subhapantuvarali) next.Rendering ofPadavi Nee Sadbhakti(saalagabhairavi) prefixed with softly flowing aalapana and expansive expatiation ofSarojadalanetri(sankarabharanam) embellished also with tanam, stood out for the scholarly spo\u000antaneity with which he surfaced the ecstatic expressions embedded in the compositions with gusto.Rama and Gnananandam in particular with his soft and deft touch on mridangam lent invigorating support. Thani by him too was a knowledgeable exercise.Rendering ofVenkatachalanilayam(sindhubhairavi) marked the grand finale.
