VM. D. Ramanathan (MDR), one of the greatest musicians of this era, was remembered by his fans at Thripunithura. The craze for the content, essence and style of his music motivated his devoted followers to organise the eighth MDR Day, a homage to the maestro. To commemorate the legend, music buffs gathered at the auditorium of Chinmaya Vidyalaya, Thripunithura.A concert by up-and-coming singer Kashyap Mahesh followed, his first one in Thripunithura. Kashyap began the concert with vandana slokas such as &#8216;Dakshinamoorthaye namah,' and Vakrathundamahakaya.'Next was &#8216;Gajavadana maam paahi' in Hamsadhwani composed by the late MDR himself. Unlike MDR, who used to sing in chowka kaala (slow pace), Kashyap sings in drutha kaalam (fast pace). If MDR had sung Tyagaraja's pancharatna keertana &#8216;Endaro Mahanubhaavulu' (Sreeragam), he would have taken an hour at least. Kashyap took just around 20 minutes, even after singing all the chittaswaras and so on.The short alaap of Panthuvarali revealed the range of his skill. The rendering of &#8216;Siva Siva Siva Ennaraada' by Tyagaraja was elegant, as also was &#8216;Vararaagalaya'(Chenchukamboji) by Tyagaraja. He also rendered &#8216;Hariharaputhram Saasthaaram' by Dikshitar and &#8216;Bhogeendrasaayinam' (Kunthalavaraali) by Swati Tirunal.Before going on to the main raga of the day, Kashyap also took the rare raga Vijayasree &#8211; a janya raga of the 39th melakartha raga, Jhalavarali.Deep alapanaThe alapana of &#8216;Sankarabharanam' was deep and excellent. Kashyap's selection of &#8216;Sarojadalanethri' by Syama Sastri for the same was apt. It increased the overall sublimity of the concert. The swara and niraval supported it well.Experienced violinist Trichur C. Rajendran followed him well throughout the concert. At times, with his skill, he even led the concert. Chennai S. Thyagarajan (mridangam) and Uduppi Sreedhar (ghatam) accompanied appropriately. The gathi bhedam of the mridangam artiste was commendable during the kirtana and taniavartanam.Kashyap sang the short tukkadas &#8216;Eppovaaruvaa' (Jonpuri) by Gopalakrishna Bharati, &#8216;Karuna cheyvaan' (Yadukulakamboji) by Irayimman Thampi and &#8216;Varakkul enna maatte,' a jaavali by Dharmapuri Subbaraayar in Kapi. The tillana in Misra Sivaranjini composed by Maharajapuram Santhaanam was a rare one. Kashyap's singing of both gaandhaaraas was exceptional. Apart from these, he also sang a thiruppukazh &#8216;Apakaara nindepattuzhalaathe' (Chakravakam) by Arunagirinathar.After the mangalam, Kashyap sang &#8216;Lokaa samasthaa sukhino bhavanthu, Ohm Saanthi Saanthi Saanthi' in Revathi, much to the surprise and delight of listeners. Evidently, Kashyap, a disciple of T.V. Gopalakrishnan, appears to be a follower of Chembai baani.Earlier, C.R.R. Varma, father of musician and Rama Varma, inaugurated the function A special message from Balaji, son of MDR, was also read out at the event.
