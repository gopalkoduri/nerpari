VMost of their choices went in favour of popular compositions. Bhairavi ata tala varnam and a pr&#233;cis of Chamaram initiated their recital. &#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam&#8217; and the delectable designs of kalpanaswaras went on full steam shared by Ramesh and Malathy in equal measure. The array arranged in a catchy mode set in the ascending and descending notes of the raga was exemplary. Can there be a better selection than the Arabi Pancharatnam &#8216;Sadinchane&#8217; to whet the appetite of the connoisseur and to give impetus to the concert at that juncture? It powerfully illuminated the proceedings.After the exalting pancharatnam, the Chitta Ranjani Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Nada Tanumanisam&#8217; floated through next to make way for the heavy exposition of Dwijavanti. Several burnished phrases gave extra glow to the Dikshitar&#8217;s gem &#8216;Akhilandeswari&#8217; which moved on the royal pace it deserved.A feisty Mohanakalyani essay alternated between the players introduced an absolutely enticing Muthiah Bhagavathar composition &#8216;Sivam Vrashaparootam Srikaram&#8217; a fast moving one with the composer&#8217;s characteristic matrix of a very colourful chittaswaram rolled with wonderful combinations. It was time for the Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi. Ramesh and Malathy elucidated Thodi through sancharas chosen and picked with care. The artists&#8217; quality and maturity came to the fore in this exercise. While the raga alapana was mainly taken care of by Ramesh with strong phrases, the tanam was managed by Malathy on the lower and middle level later concluded by Ramesh. The pallavi set in Adi talam two kalai fulfilled the mandatory necessities of trikalam and ragamalika swarams in Mohanam, Sriranjani, Soorya and Kaanada. The final swara sallies with shadjam as key note by both were impressively developed.The sincerity and traditional school are the highly favourable aspects of this duo&#8217;s music. At times such obstinacy may likely to create a yawn in the listener, but Ramesh and Malathy, knowing the importance of the tempo of the concert, never allowed it to slump at any point with the full cooperation of fine rhythmic support from Kallidaikuruchi Sivakumar and Adambakkam Sankar on mridangam and ghatam in full form. Their tani avartanam was short but striking.The post thani was sated with brisk and bright numbers like a kriti of Annamacharya in the raga Bhujangini, &#8216;Eppadi Paadinaro&#8217; in Bimplas, a completely new and jet set number in the raga Thara Sammodini and the concluding &#8216;Karpagame Kan Paarai&#8217; in Madhyamavati.
