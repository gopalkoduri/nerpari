VKathakali vocalists have for decades been inexorably drawn to the brigas, gamakas and swaraprastharam employed in Carnatic music compositions, though their space in the organic structure of Kathakali is constricted. Of the leading singers of the day, Kottakkal Madhu is a prominent name. In this DVD, Madhu shares his musical faculties with Carnatic vocalist Trichy Ganesan. Both of them are endowed with energetic voices and &#8216;ragajnanam.'After the sloka &#8216;Ekadantam,' Trichy Ganesan opens the fusion music concert with the all too familiar Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Vaathapi ganapathim' in raga Hamsadhwani. Half-way through the composition, he stops and Madhu picks up the thread by singing &#8216;Hariharavidhinuta' in the same raga from the Thodayam, the invocatory item in Kathakali. Since the bhava of both these is bhakti, there appears to be nothing that is striking about the singing. Ganesan proceeds on to the sloka &#8216;Peethambaram karavirachita&#8230;' and then to the kirtana &#8216;Sreekamalambike' in Sriragam.Evocative singingThe evocative singing of Ganesan finds a match in Madhu when the latter renders the time-honoured padam &#8216;Ajitha Hare' from the play &#8216;Kuchelavritham.' The kirtanas and padams that follow in ragas Saveri and Durbar bring out the import of the sahitya in full measure. While Ganesan sings the virutham expressing the rich nuances of the raga &#8216;Brindavana saranga,' Madhu's slow-paced singing of &#8216;Mathi Mathi Viharam' from the play &#8216;Banayudham' at times runs contrary to the contextual emotion.Ganesan's rendition of Papanasam Sivan's &#8216;Karthikeya Gangeya' in raga Todi and Madhu's singing of &#8216;Lokapaalanmare' from &#8216;Nalacharitam' bear an individual imprint. While Madhu's &#8216;Veera Virata' in raga Husaini is delectable, the last charanam of the padam &#8216;Urjithaasaya' in raga Kamboji, inadvertently destroys the sahitya for the sake of sangatis. As Ganesan sings the frequently heard &#8216;Enna thavam' in raga Kapi, Madhu renders &#8216;Vasavasa Sootha' from &#8216;Nalacharitam,' emphasising two different moods, respectively. The recital ends with a thillana in raga Hindolam and the slokam, &#8216;Kasturithilakam' in Ragamalika. Both do not have much of a consequence although these pieces might satisfy a broad spectrum of listeners.A host of musical instruments, string and percussion, tries to interact in this DVD, functionally and independently along predictable lines. While all the accompanists are competent, Panamanna Sasi's mellifluous edakka deserves mention.
