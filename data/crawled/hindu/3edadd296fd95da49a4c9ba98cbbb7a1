VMaharajapuram S. Srinivasan and Maharajapuram S. Ganesh Viswanathan (vocal support)Carnatic classicalCD - Price - Rs. 199&#8216;Vinayaka Vigna Vinayaka,&#8217; a Sanskrit composition of Swami Ganapati Sachidananda in the gana raga melodies Nattai, Gowla, Arabhi, Varali and Sri Raga are embellished by kalpanaswaras in all the ragas by the duo, the younger artiste showing much promise in his sequences.The reverse swara passages, ending with a korvai in Nattai are meticulously handled with captivating sarvalagu matrices. &#8216;Velan Varuvarodi&#8217; in Shanmukhapriya, Khambodi,  Saveri, Bilahari and Kedaragowla is a handsome effort, while Purandaradasa&#8217;s &#8216;Kelo Sachcharita&#8217; in Maand, Durbari, Tilang, Vijayanagari and Desh truly transports the rasika to an elevated devotional plane. Padmacharan&#8217;s &#8216;Manave Mantralaya&#8217;  is on Guru Raghavendra. esNalinakanti, Bhairavi, Vasanthabhairavi, Kedaram, Saranga, Ranjani, Nilambari, Kalyani, Mukhari, Shanmukhapriya, Khambodi  and Hamsanandi are chosen by Krishnaswamy for his &#8216;Nalini Kanti Mathim&#8217; that has been given a compelling melodic statement by the singers underlining that salvation through music is the easiest mode of worship.&#8216;Ksheerabdi Kannige&#8217; in Kuranji, Yamuna Kalyani, Durbari Kanada, Sindubhairavi and Manirangu is a Purandaradasa composition, and the father and son have exhibited a spontaneous overflow of bhakti and emotional involvement. Cuddalore Subramanyam&#8217;s &#8216;Ragathil Siranda Ragam Edhu&#8217; crowns the programme in style. A couple of traditional weighty ragamalikas by Dikshitar, Veena Kuppaier Seetharamayya would have also been appropriate for this imaginative agenda.
