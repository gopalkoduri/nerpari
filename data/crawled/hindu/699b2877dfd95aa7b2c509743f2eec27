VLALITHAA KRISHNANHamsadhwani played gracious host to the lecture-demonstration, ``Rare Compositions of Syama Shastri" by senior vidwan A. Sundaresan, organised by the Lions Club International at the initiative of the District Chairperson for Development of Carnatic Music, S. Balasubramaniam and Akhila Ramajayam.A cash award was also presented to Hamsadhwani. In their felicitations, K.S.Mahadevan, eminent music critic, T.K.Govinda Rao, senior vidwan, andR.Ramachandran of Hamsadhwani dwelt upon the invaluable contribution of Sundaresan in assimilating Syama Shastri's compositions and his dedicated mission in propagating them in addition to other Trinity compositions.Source of inspirationSundaresan outlined the life history of Syama Shastri and his source of inspiration. Born at Tiruvarur in 1763 into a family of Devi upasakas, steeped in the tradition of offering daily worship to Bangaru Kamakshi, Venkatasubramanian, affectionately called Shamakrishna (which became his mudra) came to be known as Syama Shastri, one of the great Trinity of composers in Carnatic music. His intense devotion to Devi transcended ritualistic worship to become am outpouring of bhakti which found expression in his compositions characterised by an intricate blend of raga, laya and tala.Although his early musical endeavours were discouraged by his uncle, destiny guided him to his guru, a sangita-swami from Kasi who imparted knowledge of raga vibodha and tala prastara.Under further guidance from Pachimiriam Adiappa, his fine musicianship reached fruition and he became highly adept at pallavi exposition. His mastery over laya intricacies manifested in the structuring of his varnams, swarajatis and krithis. Great importace was given to chowka kala as chowkam translated into sowkhyam.``Try speeding up a Syama Shastri composition and chances are you'll stumble, quite obviously," explained the artiste. Several compositions favour the ateeta anahata eduppu and are set to chapu and triputa talas.Prefacing each composition with a helpful explanation, the artiste, with vocal support from his disciples Gayathri Venkatraghavan and Vasumathi Desikan and accompanied by V.V.Ravi (violin) and R.Ramesh (mridangam), began with Chatusra jati Ata tala varnam ``Naa mana vini" in Saurashtram, which soothed with its gently classical flavour, the composer's total devotion and surrender to the Divine Mother illustrated by the thrice-repeated use of ``Nammithi" (I believe) in the anu pallavi.Interesting anecdoteTouching upon faith-affirming incidents, the artiste related an instance where Devi herself is said to have assumed the form of a little girl, to bring the milk meant for the naivedyam, thus conferring her blessings on Syama Shastri. Identifying himself as the child of the Mother of the Universe (Jagadamba), he sought her grace as ``Talli," ``Amba" and ``Mayamma."In ``Pahimam Sri Rajarajeshwari" (Nattai), the artiste mused on the possibility of this kriti being composed prior to the three famous swarajatis (in Bhairavi, Yadukula Khambodi and Todi), on the basis of the term ``swarajati kalpita sangeeta rasike" in the sahitya. Ramesh's swift and sure strokes enhanced the powerful gait of the kriti.The Varali krithi ``Karuna Joodavamma" was a shining example of the emphasis on raga bhava wherein the composition commenced at the tara stayi shadja to descend in a graceful arc laced with a myriad anuswaras that highlighted various shades of the gandhara.The composer often resorted to the device of swarasahitya and swarakshara, the latter seen in the bhava-soaked phrase ``sa daa."Age did not lessen the impact of the compelling rakthi-laden prayogas of Sundaresan's scholarly exposition of Yadukulakhambodi to which the violinist responded with a commendable essay.The majestic ``Kamakshi" swarajati that followed radiated waves of karunya rasa, with the portrayal of the goddess as an ocean of compassion and the composer's yearning to attain salvation at her feet.The serene majesty of Todi was all-pervasive in ``Emani migula" in praise of Dharmasamvardhani of Tiruvaiyaru.Bottom Template Starts
