VKaivalya is on the right musical trackSangeetha Ksheera Sagaram featured a spirited concert of Kaivalya Kumar as part of its monthly promotion concert in Thyagaraya Gaana Sabha. Initially trained by Seshiah Sastry, Kaivalya is currently under the tutelage of Lalitha Shivakumar from Chennai, mother of Nityashree Mahadevan.Kaivalya is on the right musical track, and his attitude  reflected in the day&#8217;s concert.He began his recital with a rare varnam of Syama Sastry in Begada with good presentation.Sri Ganapathein Sowrastra with little swaram was also neat.Evarurain Mohanam was sung with a good feel which came out well followed by a brief ragam of Sarangamalahar forSree Maha Bala, a composition of Muthiah Baghavatar.Kaivalya then took up Karnataka Devagandhari, and his attempt was brave enough. His presentation came out systematically with all the sancharas of the ragam.Deeksitar&#8217;sPancha Shatpeeta Rupiniwas the krithi which was neatly presented with swaram at its best.The main attraction was the expansion of Poorvikalyani in a detailed way. Here Kaivalya brought out the nuances of the ragam with imagination, and renderedParama Pavana Ramain steady laya with simple swaram.Overall, he gave an improvised concert showing progress in his performance.O. Rajashekar, an up and coming violinist, showed good anticipation with his performance with his Poorvikalyani being particularly good. Mullapudi Laxmanarao, son and disciple of  Mullapudi Sreerama Murthy, accompanied well on the mridangam. His krithi following could be better and his tani was delightful. On the whole, Kaivalya showed lot of promise in his concert.P.S.G
