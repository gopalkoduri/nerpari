VVocalist Thirumalai Srinivas, accompanied by Jyotsna Manjunath (violin), Anoor Dattatreya Sharma (mridanga) and Dayanand Mohithe (ghata), performed under the auspices of the Nadajyothi Sri Thyagaraja Swamy Bhajana Sabha, Bangalore, recently.The inherent magnificence of Shyama Shastri's swarajathi &#8220;Kamakshi&#8221; in Bhairavi raga and misra chapu thala was manifest in the mellow rendition of the piece, suffused with raga bhava, bedecked with subtle inflections, and articulated with clarity. &#8220;Bagayanayya&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in Chandrajyothi raga and adi tala, preceded a brief sketch of Sourashtram, incorporating all its key elements in a nutshell. The Ponnayya Pillai composition &#8220;Ranganathude&#8221; in rupaka tala, a fine choice, was presented in a mellow kalapramana, with the madhyamakala sahitya in the charanam acquiring a sheen of its own.A luminiscent alapana of Nalinakanthi revealed the impressive improvisational faculties of the artiste in a methodical exploration of the melodic possibilities of the scale. The expansion in the tara sthayi, highlighting the juxtaposition of gandhara and the madhyama, were particularly imaginative. The kalpana swaras appended to GNB's &#8220;Nee Padame Gathi&#8221; in rupaka tala were brightened with rhythmic sequences that coalesced perfectly with the structure of the raga and the sahitya of the krithi itself. &#8220;Deva Deva Jagadeeshwara&#8221;, the Swathi Thirunal composition in Purvikalyani raga and adi tala, sung in a brisk tempo, followed.The main raga of the evening, Karaharapriya, was elaborated in detail, with multiple sancharas around each of the notes, with several shades of swaras such as the nishada being clearly discernible. Thyagaraja's &#8220;Pakkala Nilabadi&#8221; in misra chapu tala, also sung without undue haste, was reinforced with a neraval at the charana line beginning &#8220;Manasuna&#8221;, emphasising the emotional content of the lyrics and maintaining a laudable sense of proportion. Sound expertise and experience were revealed in the kalpana swaras which also included some gathi variations and ended with a spell of diminishing tala cycles around the tara sthayi shadja. The violinist, who excelled in her solo raga alapanas and in her prompt rejoinders to the vocalist's kalpana swaras, and the percussionists whose skilful synchronisation, anticipation and support were evident throughout, contributed much to the success of the concert.
