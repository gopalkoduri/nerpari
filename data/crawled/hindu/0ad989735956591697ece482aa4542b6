VViolin recitalDr. M. Narmadha.\u000aViolin recital.\u000aHindustani Classical.\u000aLive at Amritsar.\u000aMRP not mentioned.Performing in both the styles of classical Indian music has been an heirloom of the Parur School of violinists. M. Narmadha, a very versatile artist, is able to offer Hindustani music of a high quality without traces of the Carnatic system, which she plays more frequently. This recording is from a live concert held in Amritsar.The tabla accompanist Ramkumar Mishra provides understanding rhythmic support. Commencing with a leisurely alap of Yaman wherein Narmadha halts at the Jeeva swaras and exhibits her manodharma, provides a bright start to the concert.The Ektaal composition &#8216;Kaahe Sakthi Kaiseke' is a smooth extension of the alap and is refined and pleasing. Following immediately is a Drut in Teental &#8216;Aeriali Piyabin' in the same melody.The Durga raag exposition is weighty without any forays into the Carnatic Suddha Saveri. The Maseetkhani gat in rupak tal leads on to a beautiful composition &#8216;Jai Jai Jai Durge Mata' in Ektaal. Narmadha's brief vocalisation of the lyrics reveals the good singer in her.A Thumri in raga Khamaj is engaging. Narmadha concludes with a bhajan 'Payoji Maine Rama Ratana Dhana Payo.' This bhajan was popularised by the late D.B. Paluskar. It is refreshing to hear this number played well. Though a brief concert, this disc gives great listening pleasure.
