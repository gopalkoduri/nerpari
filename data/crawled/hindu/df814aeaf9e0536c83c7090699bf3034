Narayanan&#8217;s residence in Kozhikode, paid homage to the composer on his 233rd birth anniversary.Dileep Kumar, a disciple of Mangad Nateshan, was accompanied by Trivandrum Sampath on the violin and V. Rajashekhar on the mridangam. He began the concert with the charming Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Panchamathanga mukha ganapathimam&#8217; in Malahari raga. The evening was devoted to Dikshitar compositions.Next came the celebrated keerthanam &#8216;Annapoorne Vishalakshi&#8217; in Shama raga. Dileep&#8217;s singing did justice to the lyrics and it evoked a devout ambience.It was followed by the popular kriti &#8216;Kanchadalayathaakshi&#8217; in Kamalaamanohari. Fine nuances of the raga were highlighted in his raga alapana and he enriched it with some crisp bhava-laden swarams. The vocalist then rendered &#8216;Sarasijanabha sodari&#8217; in Nagagandhari.&#8216;Anandamruthakarshini,&#8217; one of the most beautiful songs in Amruthavarshini raga, evoked the feel of a cool summer shower. The piece was adorned with some interesting swarams. A rare piece &#8216;Soma Sundara&#8217; in Sudha Vasantham raga was short and sweet.It was followed by &#8216;Shreeguruguhataarayaashumam&#8217; in Sudha saveri. In Dikshitar sampradayam the raga is Devakriya.The main song was &#8216;Karikalabhamukham&#8217; in Saveri. Dileep rendered the raga and the song with a great deal of care and sincerity. His raga alapana unfurled the best shades of Saveri. Niraval was sung at &#8216;Kaveri thadakasthitham, saveri raaganutham.&#8217;Sampath was a treat for the listeners. The main piece lasted for almost 45 minutes and it was appreciated by the audience.Thaniavarthanam by Rajashekhar was noteworthy and he did his guru, TVG, proud.&#8216;Dharmasamvardhini&#8217; in Madhyamavati concluded the concert.
