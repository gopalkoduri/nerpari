VAmong the young artistes featured in the Talent Spot Concerts, part of the 63rd Sri Ramanavami Music Festival organised by the Shree Seshadripuram Rama Seva Samithi, Bangalore, was vocalist Anjana P. Rao, accompanied by Vibhudendrasimha (violin) and R. Karthik (mridanga).A melodious start was made with a two-speed rendition of &#8220;Varanasyam Pranamamyaham&#8221;, Mysore Vasudevacharya's varna in Kanada raga and adi tala. A short alapana of Saraswathi raga, a good effort with some brigha-laden phrases, was suffixed with the krithi &#8220;Hari Hari Hariyani&#8221; set to adi tala and a few fluent avartanas of kalpana swaras. &#8220;Palisenna Gopalakrishna&#8221; in Vasantha, rendered in a lively tempo was succeeded by a compact elaboraton of Reetigaula that adhered to the complex structure of the raga, accentuated with smooth symmetrical phrases. Thyagaraja's &#8220;Nannu Vidachi&#8221; in mishra chapu thala, was supplemented with a proportionate neraval and kalpana swaras ending with diminishing avartanas at the tara sthayi shadja.The concert, on the whole, was well structured within the stipulated time frame, with a variety of ragas and compositions, and competent support from the accompanying artistes.A more reposeful approach to alapana, exploring the depths and expanses of the raga, and cultivation of the naturally sweet voice to its full potential, especially in the mandra sthayi, would complement and enhance the diligent tutelage that the young artiste has received.*** Amrutha Shankaranarayanan, accompanied by Anuthama Murali (violin) and R. Nagendra (mridanga), presented a vocal recital lasting about an hour and a quarter, as part of the ongoing Sri Ramanavami Celebrations of the Sri Rama Seva Mandali.The concert commenced with a sketch of Shuddhabangala raga and the Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Ramabhakthi Samrajya&#8221; in adi tala, to which a few kalpana swaras were appended, revealing a forceful voice and bold articulation. Deekshithar's &#8220;Ramachandram Bhavayami&#8221; in Vasantha was also ornamented with kalpana swaras, though more clarity in the enunciation of the lyrics was required at certain junctures.A compact raga alapana of Shanmukhapriya followed, testifying to considerable improvisational skills and voice control. Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer's &#8220;Marivere Dikkevarayya Rama&#8221; set to adi tala was underscored by a brief, but beautiful neraval at &#8220;Sannuthanga Sri Venkatesa&#8221;, and succinct kalpana swaras in the second speed.Mohanam was elaborated next with full-throated and bhava infused sancharas that ascended quickly and dwelt for the major part in the tara sthayi.&#8220;Mohana Rama&#8221;, the Thyagaraja composition set to adi tala was rendered with kalpana swaras in two speeds, incorporating spontaneous patterns without rhythmic excesses, with excellent support from the violinist and the mridangist, and concluding with a short but expert tani avarthana. The performance, which adhered scrupulously to the allotted duration without sacrificing any of the requisite ingredients, was indicative of a style and repertoire sustained by unswerving devotion to tradition.Performing opportunities at prestigious venues such as these are important milestones in the careers of aspiring artistes. Unfortunately, attendance at both concerts was sparse, and the presence of a few more rasikas in the audience would have been a source of great encouragement and satisfaction for the young musicians.
