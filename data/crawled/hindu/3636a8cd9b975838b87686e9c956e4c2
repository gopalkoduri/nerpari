VThe Tyagaraja Jayanthi concert of Malladi Brothers Sriram Prasad and Ravikumar, at Sri Krishna Gana Sabha, reflected their vocal exposition which was the focus, both in interpretation of kirtanas and raga alapanas.Their technique has gained sophistication. The quality of the recital served their objective to exhilarate, even as the heritage of Saint Tyagaraja was well preserved in the rendering of kirtanas.Three ragas were taken up for alapana &#8211; Begada and Bhairavi by Ravikumar, and Poorvikalyani by Sriram Prasad.The sancharas were nicely spaced.Robust sancharasAn austere approach to ragas and kirtanas can rob them of emotion and joy. Only when the inner peace and poise get manifested in the exposition can Tyagaraja's music be experienced to the fullest. However, the performance of Malladi Brothers lacked that tranquil quality. The raga landscape was startling with robust sancharas.Of the three ragas, Begada (&#8216;Lokaavana Chatura') was interpreted with scholarship, and with an interplay of korvais and swift passages. In the violin solo of Embar Kannan, the beauteous niches of Begada were well brought out.Bhairavi was dealt with more elaborately (&#8216;Upachaaramu') with speedy sancharas. It was marked both by lucidity and uniform tonal extravagance.There was, however, a clever adjustment of modulation and direction.The Poorvikalyani alapana was more sober and enjoyable. The kirtana was &#8216;Paraloka Saadanamey.'The other kritis presented included &#8216;Sangita Sastra Gnanamu' (Mukhari), &#8216;Sobillu Sapta Swara' (Jaganmohini), &#8216;Kotinadulu' (Thodi) and &#8216;Sitapathe' (Khamas).In the programme, emotionally, the most satisfying was &#8216;Oorake Galkuna' (Sahana) sung with compassion to tap the sensitivity contained in the structure of the kirtana.The bhava was well conceived, invoked and experienced. The concert would have gained more aesthetic status with lyrical softness.Soulful violinIn the solo versions of the ragas, Embar Kannan stressed on harmony and balance.The vinyasas revealed his extraordinary insight into the characteristic shades of the ragas. His technique rested on brevity and vividness.The mridangam player, M. L. Narayana Raju, offered subdued support in the song segment, and opened out in the tani with erudite korvais that dazzled with excellent craftsmanship.The ghatam player, N. Guruprasad, showcased his talent in the company of the mridangam player.
