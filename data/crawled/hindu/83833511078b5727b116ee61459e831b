V&#8216;Kapaali,&#8217; Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s song in Mohanam was presented with alapana and swarakalpanas. &#8216;Enraikku Sivakrupai Varumo&#8217; by Neelakanta Sivan in Mukhari followed immediately. &#8216;Anna Poorne, Visaalaakshi&#8217; in Sama and &#8216;Nee Dhaya Raadhaa&#8217; in Vasanthabhairavi added a wholesomeness to the concert before she began her main piece in Purvikalyani, &#8216;Enneramum Un Naamam&#8217; by Syama Sastri. Niraval for the lines, &#8216;Anbudan Unnai Naan Adaikkalam Adainthen&#8217; was quite good.She had also allotted enough time for lighter songs which are usually looked forward to by the audience in small towns. &#8216;Jagadhodhaarana&#8217; by Purandaradasa was authentic, with excellent diction. &#8216;Ragathil Siranda Raagamedhu&#8217; (Cuddalore Subramaniam) was a straight hit, with the engaging lyrics sung in many ragas. After &#8216;Thaa Thaiyendraaduvar&#8217; and &#8216;Sarvam Brahma Mayam&#8217; she concluded with &#8216;Kurai Ondrum Illai&#8217; (Listeners&#8217; choice).Her style of singing resembles that of Nithyasree Mahadevan (both have been trained under the same guru) and this fact is appreciated by the majority of the audience. However, she must break free from this image and establish a style of her own, if she wants to make a mark in the field of music, already flooded with young stars. With her passion for music and her determination to succeed, she is expected to do so very soon. Palghat Swaminathan on the violin and K.S.Mahesh Kumar on the mridangam were a great source of support, encouraging and appreciating the young artist and giving their best to make the concert impressive.
