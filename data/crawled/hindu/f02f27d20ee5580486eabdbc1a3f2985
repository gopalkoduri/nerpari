Called &#8216;Indian Ocean Live in Delhi&#8217; Susmit Sen, whose self stylised guitar is considered to be the basis of Indian Ocean&#8217;s unique sound, said, &#8220;Amit&#8217;s idea of recording it live got everyone&#8217;s support and here it is before all to enjoy the two hour jazzy performance by the band at Garden of Five Senses.&#8221; Susmit has often been noticed for the serenity with which he plays the guitar and is called the &#8216;sage&#8217; by the fellow members. &#8220;The audience is the source of our energy and we all believe we are best on stage,&#8221; he added.
