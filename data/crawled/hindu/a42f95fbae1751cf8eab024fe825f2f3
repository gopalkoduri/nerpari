VVijay Siva's music recital on the second day of the Tygaraja aradhana celebrations showed his perceptive penchant to bring out the aesthetic composition of the rakti of the ragas and make it seep into the consciousness of the listeners.His total involvement and commitment in making it possible made the kutcheri a class apart. Flagging off the concert with &#8216;Janakiramana' (Suddhaseemanthini) the following &#8216;Sogasuga' (Sriranjani) was a musically elegant version. His alapana of Pantuvarali for the kriti, &#8216;Raghuvara' with unusual prayogas exuded the raga bhava in a positive style.The kritis, not commonly handled by artists, &#8216;Bhajare Bhaja Maanasa' (Kannada) and &#8216;Evarani' (Devamruthvarshini) were impressive presentations. In the raga vinyasam of Sankharabharanam the raga was unfolded with appropriate moorchanas revealing the vocalist's vidwat and manodharma for the kriti, &#8216;Enthuku Bethala.'Delineation of Kaapi with appealing phrases in the middle and upper registers was awesome for the kriti, &#8216;Intha sowkya.'&#8216;Lavanya Rama' (Poornashadjam), &#8216;Dasarathanandana' (Asaver), &#8216;Nee Dayache Rama,' and &#8216;Pavanastuti' were the other items on the agenda.Vittal Ramamurthy's mature approach in his solo versions of the ragas and swara repartees with his deft bowing added extra charm. The tonal variations of Vaidyanathan on the mridangam supplemented by Mohanram on the ghatam buoyed up the concert.Restrained renditionThe performance of Malladi brothers, groomed by the veteran Nedunuri Krishnamurthy, was characterised by fullness of expression in raga vinyasams and presentation of kirtanans with clarity in diction. A unique fragrance of Nattai wafted in with the commencement of &#8216;Ninne Bhajana' with swaras. The following &#8216;Sreenadhadhi Tyagaraja' in Kalyani and &#8216;Ma Baala' (Asaveri) were well-restrained renditions steeped in raga bhava. The Kedaragowla raga alapana for the kriti, &#8216;Venuganalolulu' with its characteristic idioms and apt niraval and swaras were refreshing. Their Mohanam alapana was a linear development interspersed with swift creative flashes through the octaves and a comfortable negotiation with the mandhra sthayi for the kriti, &#8216;Mohana Rama.' The devotional aspect of their music was evident in &#8216;Theliyaleru Rama,' &#8216;Amma Ravamma,' &#8216;Koluvayunnade' and &#8216;Rama Rama Seetha.'Balasubramaniam imparted deft touches and delicate shades to Mohanam on the violin.The compelling enthusiasm of Prakash's rhythmic sallies on the mridangam with Suresh's (ghatam) was an apogee of rhythm.Classy renditionT.M. Krishna's saareeram, measured rhythmic approach to ragas in the middle and higher octaves and his nonchalant ability to tap his manodharma lay bare the core of Carnatic music to the rasikas. His gimmicks and body language do not bother them. His performance vigour and exploration of new vistas of creativity came to the fore. His opening &#8216;Merusamana' in Mayamalavagowla with long niraval and an overdose of swaras was acclaimed at every stage of his flights of fancy.His alapana of Kurinji for the kriti, &#8216;Dhyanamu' with maze-like sancharas woven around winding paths and twists was classy despite gesticulations. His raga delineation of Varali for the kriti, &#8216;Kana Kana Ruchira,' traversing the three segments with full focus on the raga bhava was a demonstration of his heightened ability to harness his manodharma.&#8216;Alagalella' brought out the spirit of the bard's plea to Lord Rama with poignancy.Amirtha Murali provided melodic modulation and perpetual softness in bowing. A thick layer of respectability and a synthetic blend of brisk and thin beats with chiselled phrases from Manoj Siva (mridangam) and Sridharkumar (ganjira) marked the percussion wing.Rooted in classicismNeyveli Santhahagopalan's concert was rooted in classicism without swerving from the beaten track. His opening &#8216;Girirajasudha' was appended with swaras. The following &#8216;Thulasidala' (Mayamalavagowla) was reflective of the pious and devotional mood of the bard in offering varied kinds of flowers to Lord Rama. The niraval and swaras were reminiscent of the vocalist of the earlier times. His raga alapana of Thodi, the main piece of the kutcheri was bhava-rich for the kriti, &#8216;Daasarathi' and he excelled in his insightful niraval and swara presentation. The musical fare included &#8216;Sarasasaamadaana' in Kapinarayani. Baskar's solo essays of the ragas and swaras were in right proportion. Thiruvarur Vaidyanathan and his disciple, Abhinav Seetharaman (grandson of musicologist, Vaidyanathakrishnan) embellished the concert with their rhythmic beats in the percussion wing. It was a golden moment for young Abhinav and he was honoured with ponnadais.Rich in melodyMala Chandrasekhar's flute concert on the concluding day began with the Khamas Daru of Muthaiah Bhagavatar, &#8216;Mathe Malayadwaja' prefacing it with a verse on Lord Dakshinamurti followed by &#8216;Bantureethi' (Hamsanadham) with niraval and swaras preceded by a brief alapana for the kriti. Her Thodi raga delineation for &#8216;Raave Himagirikumari' was full of melody and depth. After &#8216;Thaye Thripurasundari' (Suddhasaveri), her raga vinyasams of Gowrimanohari (&#8216;Varalakshmi Namosthuthe'), Mohanam (&#8216;Kadambaripriye') and Kaapi for Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi were replete with aesthetic notes. Her raga sancharas for the Pallavi &#8216;Devi Shalini' in Saama, Kalyana Vasantham, Valachi, Ranjani and Amritavarshini were full of musical sentiments. Gopinath (violin) gave able support with flashes of creativity and originality. Skandasubramanian (mridangamn) and Suresh (ghatam) guided the concert with their forceful and improvised play in the thani.
