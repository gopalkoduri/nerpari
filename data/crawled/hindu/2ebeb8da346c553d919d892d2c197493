VP.R. NAIRCarnatic vocalist Trichur V.R. Dileepkumaar  enthralled the audience with his scintillating music concert held under the aegis of Edapally Sangeetha Sadas.Sahana varnam, with which he started the concert, was followed by `Pranamamyham' in Gowla (Adi). He then sung `Vande deva deva,' a Swati kriti in Begada.After a brief sketch of Mohanam, he chose to sing the Dayarani keerthana and the Dikshithar kriti `Aarunachala natham' in Saranga (Rupakam).  Dileep sang the Shyamashastri kriti `Mayamma,' without elaborating the raga. Less familiar compositions like `Sasivadana' in Chandrajyothi (Adi), `Vararagalaya' in Chenchukamboji and `Paramapurusham' in Lalithapancham (jhamba - swatahi) were some of the other pieces he rendered. Madhyamavathi was the main raga of the evening and thealapanaskimmed through the trajectory of this melodious raga. The Thyagaraja kriti `Ramakadhasudha' in chowkakalam (Adi) with mellifluous niraval andswaraprastharawas really a treat to therasikas.Throughout the concert, the violin accompaniment of Edapally Ajith was superb.Guinness book record holder and mridangam maestro Kuzhalmandam Ramakarishnan and Mangad K.V. Prasad on the ghatom complemented each other and the thani they played was breathtaking.Dileepkumar wound up the concert with a few thukkadas such as `Baro krishnaya,' in ragamalika, `Eppovaruvaro' (Jogpuri) and the mangalam.This concert was truly a fine example of pure music (shudha sangeetham)without any gimmicks, a concert that connoisseurs will cherish for a long time to come.Bottom Template Starts
