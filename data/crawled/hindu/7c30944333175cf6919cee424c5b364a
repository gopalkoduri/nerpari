VThere were no stunning bursts of speed, but passages decorously in place displayed a clear silhouette.In raag Hamsadhwani, which unfolded through a madhya lay bandish, chota khyal (teen taal) and tarana, voice glides straddled octaves to achieve identical phrasing in different registers. What one missed was the emotive intensity  that could have elevated the recital from the pleasant to the memorable. With such amazing voice range and power, this artist has considerable creative potential, as yet unrealised and can make great headway as a performer by raising the bar and pushing the envelope. Janaki Rajagopalan&#8217;s harmonium and Suresh Ramaswami&#8217;s  tabla exuded  reassurance that stemmed from an easy rapport with the main artiste&#8217;s ideas.Chennai, a conservative metro? Think again. Where else would you find madisar-clad silver-haired grandmas and rudraksha-sporting senior citizens nodding enthusiastically to the beat of Sufiana qawwali and ghazal? When it comes to an open-minded receptive approach to good music, no matter what the genre, the Chennai rasika walks tall. It was an empathetic audience that came, stayed and shared in the artists&#8217; experience in Munna Shaukat Ali and Jyothi Nair Belliappa&#8217;s ghazal and qawwali presentation. The evening&#8217;s music was dedicated to the memory of Hamsadhwani Ramachandran whose encompassing vision had made the programme&#8217;s inclusion in the sabha&#8217;s music fest a reality. The recital&#8217;s USP was the instant audience connect. With catchy beat-based compositions rooted in appealing raags and clearly enunciated lyric, the two vocalists accompanied by Masood (banjo), Rajesh Dhavale (tabla) and Kasim (dholak) held the listener&#8217;s interest.Jyothi&#8217;s robust voice conducted you into the sway of &#8216;Allah Hu&#8217; layered with delicate tints by Shaukat Ali. A Yaman-based &#8216;Aashiane Ki Baat&#8217; soothed with its relaxed pace. The Sufiana qawwali &#8216;Ishq Ki Vaar&#8217; hued by a mood-inducing Megh spoke of the loss of identity between the seeker and the sought. With Jyothi&#8217;s earthy rendition and Shaukat Ali&#8217;s ascending forays gaining in intensity, the refrain &#8216;Tere Ishq Na Chaiyyan&#8217; packed quite a punch. A meditative &#8216;Yaar Tha Dil&#8217; was enhanced by Shaukat Ali&#8217;s melodious Bhagesri-affirming passages and Jyothi&#8217;s strong projection of lyric. A sensitively-nuanced Shakeel Badayuni composition in Mishra Maand glinted with emotive highlights and &#8216;Ulfat Ki Nahin&#8217; tuned to Desh was reminiscent of the gentle film melodies of the 1960s.While the artists&#8217; thorough involvement in lyric came through, enhanced by strong percussive support and lovely passages on the banjo, a shorter, more compact presentation could have avoided the fallout of the inevitable 8:30 pm audience exodus.
