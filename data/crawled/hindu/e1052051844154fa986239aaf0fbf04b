VSumitra V, though not seen on many concert platforms, is a promising vocalist that deserves greater patronage. Listening to her at Nada Inbam recently, one found that she had evolved into a competent and professional performer. Sumitra has a voice that ideally suits Carnatic music as it is neither too deep nor too shrill but pleasing and capable of traversing comfortably in mantra and tara regions.Sumitra's music carries a high quality of discipline and obedience to grammar, quite understandable as she is a product of R. Vedavalli's School. Her  raga delineations flowed in perfect channels in unison with sruti.There were no overlaps, repetitions or uncertainty. The brief Devagandhari ("Tulasamma" of Tyagaraja...), neatly chiselled Saveri ("Velayya" by Koteeswara Iyer), an exhaustive treatise of Sankarabharanam ("Dakshinamurthey" by Dikshitar) and an exquisite essay of Keeravani (RTP) carried the stamp of tradition replete with eloquent karvais, akaras and rounded off without any hyperboles. Sumitra's neraval in the Saveri kriti and the pallavi "Pankaja Lochana Paahi Mukunda Mudam Dehi" in Kandajathi triputa talam also followed a systematic approach including trikalam sans superfluous frills. Sumitra's swaraprastharas were spartan, which in one way enjoyable as many times the excesses in swaras end up as a verbal assault. Amrutha Murali's advantage of being a performing vocalist helped her in playing her role as an accompanist. She was supportive without dominating the show. B Sivaraman was quite vibrant in his tani avarthanam in jumpa talam laced with several rhythmic patterns.G. SWAMINATHANBottom Template Starts
