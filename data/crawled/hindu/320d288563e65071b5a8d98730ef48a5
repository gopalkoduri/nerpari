VThe birth centenary of the late Ratnam Thampuran was celebrated at a special function that concluded with a vocal concert by Sreevalsan J. Menon.Sreevalsan began the concert with the varnam &#8216;Ninnukkori' in Vasantha raga. It was followed by popular kritis such as &#8216;Vinayaka&#8230;,' composed by Veena Kuppayyar in Hamsadhwani, the Swati Tirunal composition &#8216;Paripalayamam&#8230;' in Reethigoula, and the Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Seethapathe&#8230;' in Kamas. The elaborate alapana of Reethigoula was superb.&#8216;Ekkaalathilum unnai maravaamal&#8230;' in Poorvikalyani by Thiruvarur Ramaswami Pillai was unique in its sahithya and well received by the audience.Rare kritisWhat stood out in the concert was Sreevalsan's attempt to popularise the kritis of less-known composers and rare kritis of some great composers. &#8216;Niravadhi sukhada&#8230;,' a fast-paced Tyagaraja composition in Ravichandrika, had the audience enthralled. Parasala Ravi embellished the rendering with his measured beats on the mridangam.Sreevalsan, a disciple of the late Neyyanttinkara Vasudevan, brought out the style and singing qualities of his guru, in the rendering the main raga of the day, &#8216;Sariyavaro&#8230;' in Bhairavi. This rare kriti of Syama Sasthri in Khandajumpa taal was popularised by a few masters like K. V. Narayanaswamy and Brinda Muktha. The niraval and swara heightened the raga-bhava. Sreevalsan seems to have imbibed not just the style or &#8216;baani' of his guru but also his &#8216;jnanam.'The taniavarthanam by Professor Ravi was good, the nataas and gatis were absorbing and he played all the gatis in koruva. N. Gopalakrishnan complemented well on the ganjira.After the main piece of the evening, Sreevalsan sang two more not-very-popular kritis: &#8216;Murukanin&#8230;,' composed by Guru Surujananda in Behag, and &#8216;Sree Guruvayupure vilayadum&#8230;,' a Sundara Narayana composition in Chenchurutti. He also sang the popular Swati kriti &#8216;Aliveni&#8230;' in Kurinji rounding off with the mangalam.The programme was organised under the aegis of Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha.
