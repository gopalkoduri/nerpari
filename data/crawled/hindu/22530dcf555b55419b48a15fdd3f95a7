VT.K.GANAPATHYGayatri Venkataraghavan, a rising star among top-notch musicians of the younger generation, has all the ingredients of an accomplished singer.Her bhava-laden music with appropriate improvisations is an ample testimony to her fine training and patanthara. The rasika gets absorbed in the aura of her music made glorious with her honeyed voice turning out nuzzling musical phrasings. In her aesthetically gratifying concert, under the aegis of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore, Gayatri commenced her kutcheri with "Paamara Paalini." "Vande Vasudevam" in Sri Ragam followed by  an enlivening swara passage was impressive.The vocalist's handling of Pantuvarali for the kriti "Sankari Ninne" was a spirited exploration with sancharas that sparkled.  Her raga exposition of Kharaharapriya for the kriti "Chakkanirajamargamu" revealed erudition andgnanam. "Karunakara Madhava," "Sree Sankara"  and "Aadum Chidambarame" were rendered with a clear musical perception of emotional value.Gayathri's RTP for Charukesi demonstrated her vocal ability and the range of the raga exploration was marked by depth and delicacy. The Pallavi "Thanikai Malaimel Uraibhavan" in kanta triputa taalam and the sancharas in Mohanam, Hindolam and Behaag transported the listeners to the world of sublime music. A vibrant tillana was a fitting finale to an aesthetically satisfying recital.V.V.S.Murari acquitted himself with aesthetic grace and elegance in his solo versions of Pantuvarali, Kharaharapriya, Charukesi and swara repartees. The percussive vigour from the energetic and vivifying beats on the mridangam by Arun Prakash and on the ghatam by Guruprasad lent colour to the vocal recital.Bottom Template Starts
