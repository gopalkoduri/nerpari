V`Om Dhimiki Dhimiki Dhim,' the Shivastuti in Hindolam by charged, young voices, at the huge Krishna Gana Sabha Hall, T. Nagar, on Wednesday last, at the Gokulashtami Sangeetha Utsavam, went well with the mood. The rhythm, pace and tempo were  musically highlighted in the lyrics and in the  dhamaroo and mridangam, which enhanced the Siva Tandava effect reflected by the students of Thirupoonthurthi V. Venkatesan in their Namasankeertana bhajans.About 25 songs of various composers were presented by Swathi, Rohit, Shruthi, Lakshmi, Lavanya, Narayan, Niranjan and Raghav Shankar, as guru Venkatesan directed them on stage. As is with any Bhajana Padhati,  mangalasasanam pieces in Todaya Mangalam set the right tone.The repertoire   included prayer in soft melodies, descriptive run-up stanzas to several kritis, namavalis, and of course, the moving tarangams  of Narayana Tirtha.Abhangs, Keertans and Ashtapathis of Namdev, Tyagaraja, Jayadeva, Bhadrachala Ramdas, Sadasiva Brahmendar and Vallalar Ramalinga Adigal formed the first half of the programme.`Jaya Jaya Gokula Bala,' which rested on Bhairavi, Atana, Kambodhi, Kalyani and Suruti, and `Sarvam Brahma Maya,' were smoothly handled.  The students were accompanied by Thiruvallur Parthasarathy on the violin, Manikuddi Chandrasekaran on the mridangam and Vijayasree Raman on the harmonium.RANJANI GOVINDBottom Template Starts
