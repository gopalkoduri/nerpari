VT.V. RAMACHANDRANIt is a great privilege to listen to musicians who have had the chance to enjoy the concerts of old stalwarts in the field of classical music. The large number of people who had gathered at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Ernakulam, were treated to pure, classical music by Dr. Sreevalsan J. Menon. He is one of the best disciples of veteran singer Neyyattinkara Vasudevan.The concert was organised by `Rasikapriya.' Sreevalsan set the tempo for the evening with the familiar Varnam in Thodi, `Eranapai.' Then, he came up with the traditional `Vathapi Ganapathim' (by Dikshitar) in Hamsadwani. TheSwaraprastharas, which were rendered beautifully by the vocalist brought out the charm of this kriti. This was followed by a neat, short delineation of Dhanyasi raga culminating in the kriti `Balakrishnan Padamalar' composed by Papanasam Sivan. It was followed by Swathi Thirunal's composition `Gangeya Vasana' in Amir Kalyani. After a brisk rendering of `Niravadhisukha,' composed by Thyagaraja in Ravichandrika, the elaboration of raga Poorvikalyani was neatly done. The kriti chosen was `Sattilena Guruguha,' which was composed by Tanjore Ponnaiah Pillai.The main raga chosen for the evening was Kharaharapriya. Thealapanawas brilliant and it mesmerised the audience.Bottom Template Starts
