VThey are the present day youth icons of Carnatic music. Repositories of a large repertoire of Carnatic compositions, they have been promoting and preserving the rich traditional music they represent through their vibrant and powerful voices. It there\u000afore goes without saying that Sreeram Prasad and Ravikumar, popularly known as the Malladi Brothers, are most sought after young maestros. They have travelled extensively and performed all over the country and abroad.Instead of being proud and sitting back on the pleasant feeling,  they feel they have a big responsibility towards the youth by whom they are idolised. They have to meet a standard which they themselves have set for their performances, which includes presenting compositions in the most traditional way, as they have learnt,  continuing to learn more kritis and presenting them with utmost sincerity and devotion.The Malladis have taken Carnatic music as their full-time profession. Looking back at their path  so far, they do not have any regrets for choosing this profession. Born with a legacy and rich tradition accrued through their grandfather, the late Malladi Srirama Murthy, and through their father, a great Harikatha exponent of his time in Andhra Pradesh, the brothers have received musical training from their father, Malladi Suri Babu, who was a disciple of the great late Voleti Venkateswarulu. They have received additional training from maestros Sri Pada Pinakapani and his well-known disciple, Nedunuri Krishnamurthy.Having bagged the &#8220;Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar&#8221; in the year 2006 instituted by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, the Malladis feel that the award has come at the right time in  their career and has certainly given them encouragement. Sreeram Prasad recalls these words of Sri Pada Pinakapani: &#8220;For one who seeks good music, awards and rewards will follow automatically.&#8221;Sreeram avers, &#8220;The quintessence of Carnatic music lies in the compositions of the Trinity,&#8221;  while  his brother nods vehemently indicating his accord. Telugu being their mother tongue, do the Malladis derive special advantage in presenting Telugu compositions of Tyagaraja, Shyama Sastri and others? &#8220;Nativity counts a lot. The spirit of the composition will not be felt if the language of the composition is not known while singing,&#8221; says Sreeram.The Malladis are grateful to their rasikas for their support. Some of them have very high expectations, which in turn  helps them to work hard. On the flip side, while lots of  young people are taking up Carnatic music  professionally, most of the concert halls are filled largely with in the age group of 50-plus.&#8220;Indians  settled in the U.S. and other western countries  realise that they and their children are deprived of our rich culture. But here in India, many do not even know this,&#8221; says Sreeram.The brothers  stress that parents, particularly mothers, should play a positive role in initiating their children into Carnatic music early on. They should also take them  to music concerts and festivals. &#8220;After all, culture starts from the home,&#8221;   points out Sreeram. The Malladis are sad that rasikas are not prepared to buy tickets for Carnatic music concerts. &#8220;How long can a sabha sustain itself with corporate sponsorships?&#8221; A  rational question which time alone can answer.The Malladi brothers are in Delhi to perform in the ongoing Music Festival of Sree Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha.
