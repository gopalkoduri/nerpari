VLater, the Sadguru arrived at the beautifully decorated dais. He explained the significance of Mahasivaratri and pointed out that on this night, the northern hemisphere of the earth is positioned in such a way that there is a natural upsurge of energy in human beings. So it is possible to push a person towards spiritual peak on this day, he said.The powerful meditation guided by Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev with the chanting of &#8216;Shambo&#8217; sent many sadhakas into ecstasy.During the midnight chanting of the mantra, &#8216;Aum Namah Sivaya,&#8217; most of the people gathered in the vast pandal and  ground (nearly 6,00,000  this year) forgot themselves and danced with gay abandon. It was a rare sight to see bashful housewives and infirm old men joining the young devotees in the dance. When Sadguru himself danced on the stage, more people joined in.The powerful orchestra of the Isha Centre enhanced the effect and charged the atmosphere with the expectation of a deep spiritual experience.The Sadguru also narrated many absorbing stories during the course of his speech. A sample. A sage asked Siva what was so great about his name, &#8216;Siva Sambho&#8217;. Siva said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. You try it on the worm that is wriggling in front of you&#8221;. The saint uttered &#8216;Siva Sambho&#8217; and the worm died instantly. The sage looked at Siva with shock only to be asked to utter the mantra on the butterfly that was flitting by. The sage did so unwillingly and the butterfly fell dead. Soon a lovely fawn was sprinting in front of them. As the sage could not disobey Siva he uttered the mantra again, and lo! The fawn dropped dead.Soon, a couple came with their newborn baby to the saint to receive his blessings. This time he refused to obey Siva. But the baby spoke, &#8220;O saint! Please utter the mantra. You said that when I was a worm, I became a butterfly. From a butterfly, I became a fawn and now a human baby. If you say it now, I will become divine.&#8221; The saint realised the efficacy of the mantra.Marabin Maindhan Muthiah presented an impeccable translation in Tamil, immediately after the Sadguru&#8217;s speech in English. The Centre had invited some of the best musicians to help people remain awake. The first concert was by the multi-faceted  Balamurali Krishna, (singer, composer and adept in playing various musical instruments).Beginning with &#8216;Pahi Jagadeswara&#8217; in Ganamurthi, he presented many songs dedicated to Siva, most of them his own compositions. &#8216;Bho Sambho&#8217; in Viswambhari, &#8216;Parameshwara&#8217; (ragamalika) and &#8216;Sada Tava Pada Sannadhim Kuru&#8217; in Shanmukhapriya were presented elaborately. &#8216;Ninnu Vidisi Undalenayya, Kailasa Vasa&#8217; and &#8216;Emi Chetura Linga&#8217; were  moving. He concluded with the tillana in Garudadhwani in which he had used the sounds that were believed to have come out of the damru of Siva causing the creation of the universe. Raghavendra Rao&#8217;s violin was extremely melodious, and Balamurali&#8217;s subtle phrases were given beautiful shape when he played them on his violin. Vaidhyanathan on the mridangam and Guruprasad on the ghatam presented a scintillating thani besides meeting the challenges thrown by the vocalist with great aplomb. &#8216;Shraddha,&#8217; the musical ensemble of Shankar Mahadeven (vocal), P. Sivamani (percussion), U. Shrinivas (mandolin) and Loy Mendonsa (keyboard), presented foot-tapping music that was basically devotional.The &#8216;Siva Thandavam&#8217;  they presented with appropriate slokas, songs and throbbing rhythm kept the audience clapping along throughout. Shankar had fused Carnatic, Hindustani and Western music while the others, (each one a master in his chosen field) gave their best.However, it was Sivamani who stole the show with the variety of sounds he produced from his innumerable instruments, playing more than one instrument at a time. There were devotional renditions themed &#8216;Dancing with Siva&#8217; by Vijay Prakash and Vivek Rajagopalan. &#8216;Sounds of Isha,&#8217; Isha&#8217;s homegrown band, played energetically and kept the audience on their feet until the early morning hours. The day dawned with the powerful chanting of &#8220;Sambho&#8221; by thousands of voices that reverberated through the surrounding hills.
