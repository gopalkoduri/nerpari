VDuring Shyama Sastri&#8217;s &#8220;Nannu Brova Lalite&#8221; in raga Lalita, the two brought  the emotive aspects to the fore. Tyagaraja&#8217;s fast tempo composition &#8220;Telisi Ramachintanato&#8221; in raga Purnachandrika was a thoughtful inclusion, and the duo did it justice.Their main presentation was another Tyagaraja composition, &#8220;Entara Neetana&#8221; in raga Harikamboji.Apart from handling it well, they displayed creativity  through niraval of the phrase &#8220;Seshudu Shivunike Bhusudu Lakshmana&#8221; and subsequent swaraprastaras.Earlier, Ashwin  presented   an alap with considerable depth in it. VSK Chakrapani&#8217;s violin and Kumbakonam Padmanabhan&#8217;s support on the mridangam were encouraging and enhanced the concert.In yet another vocal duet concert, though not by siblings,  the Delhi-based S. Vasudevan and K. Venkateshwaran  gave a memorable performance.  Their presentation of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Intha Soukhyamani&#8221; in  raga Kapi, which included  the niraval of a phrase from the charanam, was impressive.Their choice for the main item was a Tevaram stanza in praise of Lord Ganesha , which they sang in raga Gowla. Though  presented brilliantly, it seemed inappropriate. The subsequent swaraprastaras were impressive. The duo&#8217;s well-synchronised voices, the support of VSK Annadurai on the violin, Lalgudi Ganesh on the mridangam and K. Ramamurthy on the ghatam made this concert  enjoyable. At Delhi Tamil Sangam, where Carnatic music concerts invariably start after a considerable delay, Mohan Santhanam from Chennai tried to keep his vocal concert lively. Most of his compositions were in   Tamil. Mohan has a promising voice and a good musical lineage (descendant of the renowned composer N. Koteeshwara Iyer). He was initiated into  music by his mother Saraswathi Santhanam  and  trained under T.R. Subramaniam, N. Ravikiran and  V.V. Srivatsa.Sadly, his  performance did not reflect  this background. Periyasami Tooran&#8217;s &#8220;Gana Nadhane&#8221; in the raga Saranga included  lively swaraprastaras. While presenting N.S. Chidambaram&#8217;s &#8220;Isai padi&#8221; in raga Charukesi, Mohan paid utmost importance to the lyrics. Gopalakrishna Bharati&#8217;s piece from &#8220;Nandanar Charitram&#8221; in raga Natakurinji underwent similar treatment. The usage of imaginative niraval enhanced the songs.Instead of skipping the swaraprastaras altogether, even a brief swara format would have given a sense of completion  to this item. The main piece of Mohan&#8217;s recital was &#8220;Thamadam Yen Swami&#8221; in raga Todi. His alap and swara patterns here were note worthy. Mohan was accompanied  by VSK Chakrapani on the violin, A. Prem Kumar on the mridangam and P. Vetriboopathy on the kanjira.
