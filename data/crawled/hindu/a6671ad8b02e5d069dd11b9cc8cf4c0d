VThe violin-venu-veena combination is soothing to the ear. The way they merge together brings up the serene image of the early morning. What seemed like a continuation of the Lalgudi heritage decades ago with the three instruments coming together, one must appreciate H.K. Venkatram for keeping such an idea going (HKV-violin; G. Ravikiran-flute; Ashwin, Anand-Veena). In fact, one must even recall that his father H.V. Krishnamurthy along with Anoor Ramakrishna (violin) and Arunachalappa (harmonium) were also a famous Carnatic music trio. &#8220;It took us a while to understand each other's style. We had to channelize our ideas before we could arrive at a harmony,&#8221; says Venkatram.With Neyveli Venkatesh on mridanga, Ramanujam on ghata and Guruprasanna on khanjari it was a six-member team at the Ramaseva Mandali at Fort High School grounds that set sail with Swati Tirunal's &#8220;Deva Deva Kalayamide&#8221; in Mayamalavagowla. There was not a dull moment in the concert, as they moved from Asaveri to Begada to Maanavathi to Mukhaari. The trio seemed to enjoy Tyagaraja's &#8220;Ra Ra Maayinti Thaaga&#8221;, particularly the enjoyable sangatis in the charana.***Mysore A. Chandan Kumar's (great grandson of violin T. Chowdiah) flute concert at Seshadripuram Ramaseva Samithi, Bangalore, made you yearn for more. Into serious performances for the last 15 years, Chandan Kumar in his Ramanavami concert (with Nalina Mohan on violin; Arjun Kumar on mridanga and B. Rajashekar on morsing) took up the Navaragamalika varna, &#8220;Mahaganapathim&#8221; (Natta), &#8220;Brochevarevarura&#8221; (Kamas), &#8220;Raghuvamsasudha&#8221; (Kadanakuthoohala), &#8220;Durmargachara&#8221; (Ranjani) and a spellbinding session of ragam-tanam-pallavi.Long electrifying sessions of swarakalpana fusing the chaturashra and tishra calculations. &#8220;Raghuvamshasudha&#8221; was presented in all the three kalas. &#8220;It is the inherent capability of Natta raga to accommodate janti swaras. Tyagaraja's pancharatna kriti in Natta is a clear case,&#8221; he said, explaining his presentation.
