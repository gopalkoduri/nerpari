VIt is with some pride and pleasure that Chennai-ites, on Saturday night,  were witness to the resurrection of the Madras Chamber Orchestra, after many years of silence. This is largely thanks to the efforts of the new conductor, Bernard Wacheux, who \u000aspends his time these days between France and India, and who has decided to dedicate his days to fostering western classical music in India. Bernard Wacheux, a violinist by profession, opened the concert by leading the orchestra as soloist in Spring from Vivaldi&#8217;s Four Seasons.The playing by the whole ensemble was delicate and at the same time assured. We had to listen carefully because of the acoustics of Museum Theatre.  The ensemble was brought well forward on the stage, and the sound was unfocussed and diffused.  That attentive listening, however, brought its own rewards. Because &#8216;Spring&#8217;  is a famous piece, and because it was so well-played, the audience was clearly delighted to hear it played live and in a lively fashion.The famous Air from J. S. Bach&#8217;s Suite in D Major was the next item.  This is often heard as a piece for violin solo, and known then as Air on the G String. But that evening&#8217;s rendition was in the original version, and serenity was the order of the moment.The  other soloist was the Belgian flutist Bernard Wystraete, who joined the Madras Chamber Orchestra in several movements from Bach&#8217;s Suite in B minor, a piece for solo flute and strings. Mr. Wystraete showed us what a silver flute can sound like in the hands of a master player. Perhaps the most famous movement from this suite is the last one, a dance form called Badinerie. This was performed with playful gusto and was repaid with enthusiastic applause.There are few indeed who would not welcome an item by W. A. Mozart in a concert, and his Andante for Flute and Strings (K. 315) was lovingly rendered, with an impressive flute cadenza before the pieces close. Bernard Wystraete is also a composer, and he played his own Lune Australe (which might be translated as Southern Moon) for Flute and Strings. A different interpretation of the heavens from Mozart&#8217;s for sure, but an invigorating and engaging piece nonetheless, and not too adventurous for our audience. As it happens, this was the second performance of this piece in Madras, but a welcome opportunity to hear an interesting and engaging work, well played.The evening ended with Edvard Grieg&#8217;s From the Time of Holgren Suite for Strings. Again, a piece which is well known, but ever delightful in its lyrical content. I must stress how impressed I was with the playing of our musicians, who comprise this reconstituted Madras Chamber Orchestra. I had come to expect nothing but ill-prepared and unenthusiastic performances from local instrumentalists.  But that evening&#8217;s concert  showed us what can happen right here in Chennai, with a competent conductor, and musicians who have the opportunity  to prepare music they care about.
