VA. SANGAMESWARANFans of the mandolin, which is essentially a western instrument, might not have envisaged the possibility of its development as an instrument for playing Carnatic music.In addition to the mandolin, the saxophone and the violin too have become an integral part of Carnatic music.Following the path treaded by mandolin prodigy, U. Srinivas, whose name is synonymous with that of the mandolin, is another youngster U. P. Raju, who performed for Nadabrahmam, in Aluva, in connection with the Swati Tirunal music festival there. The opening Kedaragoula varnam was followed by `Vaathapi' (Hamsadwani), for which he added an array ofmanodharma swaras, which culminated in a splendidly carvedmuthaippu.A `mallari' in Gambeeranatta was rendered next, which is traditionally played by nadaswaram artistes. Mayamaalavagowla was taken for a detailed alaapana and the krithi `Devadeva Kalayamithe' was neatly rendered and then came a brisk Bandureethi (Hamsanaadam).Abhogi unfurled next, with the Dikshithar kriti `Sree Lakshmy Varaham.'Naasikabhooshani was taken for raagam, thaanam, pallavi and was not so impressive as he could not bring out the difference between thesahithyaand theswaraseffectively with clear demarcation.V. V. Ravi on the violin was subdued.Salem Swaminathan on the mridangam, Elanjimel Susheel Kumar on the ghatam and Payyannur Govindaprasad on the mukharsankh played thani for raagam thaanam pallavi.Bottom Template Starts
