VThe Music Festival 2005, organised under the aegis of J.S.S. Sangeetha Sabha, concluded at the Jaganmohan Palace, Mysore. The highlight of the festival was the discussions and lecdem on classical music, apart from excellent performances.LecdemThe lecdem by Dr. C.A. Sridhar onSwara Choodamaniof the erstwhile king of Mysore, Mummadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, was enlightening. While Mysore Nagaraj and Manjunath gave interesting outlines of raga-tana-pallavi, B.S. Vijayaghavan and V. Nanjundaswamy, well-known musicologists, presented the essence of Sharana-Sahitya and the Navagraha compositions of Muthuswamy Dikshitar.Among the good performances were violin duet by R. Kumaresh and Jayanthi, veena recital by Anuradha Madhusudan and vocal duet by Rudrapatnam Thyagarajan and Taranath, who chaired the festival.The inaugural concert by Prince Aswathi Tirunal Ramavarma, student of Balamuralikrishna, was delightful. The artiste brought out a melodious tonal resonance but disappointed listeners in his technical rendition.Nevertheless, his exposition of jathis in Swathi Tirunal's composition "Saroruhasana Jaye" in Kamavardhini was impressive. The notable part of the concert was exceptional support on the mridanga by Bangalore Praveen.The Dasa sahitya of Purandaradasa ("Hodi Nagariya Mele Kayya"), Jagannatha Dasaru ("Eke Mookanade") and "Gajavadana Mam Pahi Gowri Tanaya" concluding with the tillana of Balamurali in Kuntharavarali were the other selections rendered by the artiste.Excellent violinDr. Manjunath on was excellent on the violin. The festival, which commenced more than a decade ago, has the wonderful objective of holding on to nostalgia of old Mysore, once the citadel of music.B.S.S. RAOBottom Template Starts
