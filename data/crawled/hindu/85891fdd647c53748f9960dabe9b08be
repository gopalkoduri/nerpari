VThere is no denying that she is a chip of the old block. Sriranjani Santhanagopalan displayed amazing maturity for one so young in her recent vocal concert for Kalasagaram at Keyes High School.The vocalist oozed confidence as she made her way through stylistic neraval, intricate swarakalpana, et al. To her credit, it must be said that her repertoire was not the run-of-the-mill. Her presentation was marked by clear diction and intonation as per the demands of the lyrics and language.&#160;&#160;There was no dearth of bhava even as she rapidly rendered a series of swaras non-stop for 10-15 minutes.&#160;The rich tone and tenor of her voice coupled with her tremendous staying power had the audience at her feet.Sriranjani's opening varnam set the tone of the concert with Sarasuda ninne kori&#8230; in Saveri,&#160;which testified to the range of the artist. It was rendered with &#233;lan as was the piece in Hussaini in Tamil culled out of Rama nataka stuti.&#160;&#160;Having established her credentials with the technical varnam and Vaadera daivam&#8230; in Panthuvarali,&#160;&#160;she went on to present the main raga of the evening with an extensive alapana that was too beautiful for words. Nadachi nadachi choochevo&#8230; (Karaharapriya) dripped honey with its intrinsic melody and meaningful lyrics which were further enhanced by her virtuous manodharma.&#160;She confined herself to the customary pattern of moving from sangathis to neraval to swarakalpana scaling the cycles as she manoeuvred her way through the kriti.&#160;&#160;Her strength in rendering the swaras was no doubt wonderful but the manner did not vary from one kriti to another. Her creativity at this juncture was rather predictable after one kriti.Violinist Rahul proved an animated accompanist who shared the enthusiasm of the vocalist in replaying her mode with an exactness that was superb.Tani avarthanam by Kaapa Srinivasa Rao and the laya vinyasam (serve-volley ) by the mridangam player and ghatam player (Janardhan) was inspiring.&#160;&#160;She wrapped up the concert with RTP in Kannada with the tanam once again reiterating her mastery over the medium.&#160;&#160;On the whole it was an enthralling recital.
