VA vocal duet by the Bangalore Brothers, M.B. Hariharan and S. Ashok, accompanied by C.N. Chandrasekhar (violin), Tumkur B. Ravishankar (mridanga), and S.N. Narayana Murthy (ghata) was organised recently by the R.T. Nagar Cultural Association in Bangalore.The very first item of the concert, the adi thala varna &#8220;Sarasuda&#8221; in Saveri, was a faithful representation of the gamaka infused essence of the genre. Dikshithar's &#8220;Swaminatha Pripalayashumam&#8221; in Natta raga and adi thala, which followed, was supplemented with brief kalpana swaras, some of which were reminiscent of the Pancharathna krithi in the same raga. &#8220;Suryamurthe&#8221; in Sourashtram and dhruva thala, was rendered in a measured tempo commensurate with the majesty of its structure and lyrical import.The lilting simplicity of Thyagaraja's &#8220;Sri Rama Sri Rama&#8221; set to Shahana raga and adi thala prefaced a consummate and creative exposition of Simhendramadhyamam, incorporating occasional plain notes and panchama and shadja varjya usages to great effect. Mysore Vasudevacharya's &#8220;Ninne Nammithi&#8221; in misra chapu thala, rendered at an unhurried pace, was embellished with a sumptuous yet well balanced neraval at &#8220;Pannagendra Shayana&#8221; and kalpana swaras in the second speed, which included a spell of diminishing thala cycles at the thara sthayi shadja.A bhava-laden rendition of Purandradasa's &#8220;Manava Nillisuvudu&#8221; in Nattakurinji raga and adi thala was prelude to the focus of the concert, a raga thana pallavi in Kalyani. The meticulous alapana progressed with some well-sculpted and intricate sancharas around the panchama, and several ending at the nishada and the thara sthayi rishabha. While the melodious charm of the raga was evident in the elaboration, which also included some key phrases from well known compositions, more comprehensive treatment in the thara sthayi would have augmented the impact. The beautifully contoured pallavi beginning &#8220;Ninnunera Namminanura&#8221;, set to adi thala, was expanded in detail, culminating in the rhythmic variations prescribed by convention. The kalpana swaras featured a few avarthanas in the ragas Chandrakauns, Behag, Athana and Kapi, reinforced by superlative responses from the violinist and scintillating rhythms from the percussionists in the ensuing thani avarthana.Among the concluding pieces of the concert, which was notable for scrupulous adherence to tradition and the core tenets of classicism, were the ragamalika beginning &#8220;Arabhimanam&#8221; and &#8220;Bho Shambho&#8221; in Revathi.MADHAVI RAMKUMAR
