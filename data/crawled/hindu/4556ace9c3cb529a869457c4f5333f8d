VSheela Prakash (the visually challenged artist from Mumbai) exhibited her absolute control over the instrument at her  solo violin concert held under the auspices of Nadabrahma Gana Sabha at Vanaprastha in Vadavalli, Coimbatore. The recital (average \u000ain parts) was marked by regard for traditional patanthara. Sheela&#8217;s  brisk rendition of Nattakurinji varnam was followed by &#8216;Siddhivinayakam&#8217; (Shanmukhapriya). Though her interpretation of Lathangi was sublime for the kriti, &#8216;Mariveregathikkevaro,&#8217; it was marred by swara slips in tara sthayi.&#8216;Maamavasadha&#8217; in Kaanada,  with the right dose of kalpanaswaras, was elegant.  With intense saadhakam, the artist is bound to make the grade as an instrumentalist.Radhakrishnan (mridangam) and  Jagannathan (morsing) gave able support.  Their absorbing thani, an engaging exercise in weaving complex rhythmic patterns, won accolades from  the listeners.In yet another event, Srimad Bhagavatha Sapthaha Maha Yagnam will be performed by Yagneswara Sarma (disciple of Krishna Premi) from October 26 to November 2  at Bhuvaneswari Hall in Vanaprastha, Vadavalli, The programme is jointly sponsored by Vanaprastha, Dhyanaprastha, Pyramid Complex and Sree Sankara Seva Sadhanam.
