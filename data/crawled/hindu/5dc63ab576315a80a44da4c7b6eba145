VTuned soulfully by Ariyakkudi Ramanuja Iyengar, the 30 verses of Tiruppavai are virtual treatises on each raga he chose, without sacrificing the devotional fervour.Dancer Smitha Madhav, donning the role of a singer, performed at TTD, T. Nagar, recently. She chose Andal&#8217;s &#8216;Ongi Ulagalandha Uththaman&#8217; (Arabhi-Adi). A faithful rendering it was!Blessed with a voice that strictly adheres to   sruti, Smitha interpreted Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Sri Kanthimathim&#8217; (Hemavathi-Adi) neatly. However, she should try to curb her habit of drawing away from the mike during pharan sangatis. This results in good sangatis losing their shine  due to the imbalance in sound reproduction.Anil Kumar (mridangam) with his experience on the dance stage, proved a perfect foil, with his interesting rhythmic tapping for this kriti. His arudis were inspiring.Saveri with its minor slips, failed to impress, in spite of a bright start. Karaikkal Venkatasubramaniam (violin), a disciple of T.N. Krishnan, sketched the raga with all its elements in tact.The kalpanaswaras passed muster. &#8216;Purahara nandana&#8217; (Hamir Kalyani-Adi-Dikshitar) preceded the Hamasanadham alapana. Adopting open-throated singing, Smitha packed it with sancharas that shone with brilliance.Oothukkadu Venkatasubbaier&#8217;s &#8216;Kalyanarama&#8217; (Adi) was presented with verve. Her kalpanaswaras at &#8216;Nirantaram Guruguha&#8217; in Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Parandhaamavati Jayati&#8217; (Dharmavati-Rupakam) at top speed with Anil joining in, were interesting.Developing the main raga Khambodi with grace, Smitha took time painting it phrase by phrase to give it an authentic touch. Karaikkal proved his mettle with ease in his responses. &#8216;Rangam Sri Rangam&#8217; (Guru Surajananda-Mishra Chapu) saw her proceeding to swaras, avoiding niraval which was in the asking.Anil Kumar&#8217;s tani saw him unleash an array of rhythmic strokes that enlivened the atmosphere.
