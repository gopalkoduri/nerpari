V(KRISHANGAN@GMAIL.COM)Nandini of Trivandrum has all the ingredients of an accomplished singer. Her concert, organised by Nadabrahma Gana Sabha, Vanaprastha, at Vadavalli, Coimbatore, brought to the fore her creativity that was marked by expressive dynamism and aesthetic finesse.Her pliant voice with skilful modulations made her renditions ear worthy.Her curtain raiser, &#8216;Unnadiye Engathi,' a GNB sahithyam in Bahudari, was a winsome presentation.The brief outline of Shanmukhapriya for the kriti, &#8216;Thanthai Thaai Irundhal' brimmed with feeling.Subtle prayogasDuring her alapanas for the Sahana kriti, &#8216;Chittam Irangaadadenayya,' and for the one in Thodi, &#8216;Thaaye Yasoda,' Nandini traversed the octaves with nonchalant ease. They were melodious with a penchant for sangatis and subtle prayogas.The contours of the ragas' beauty stood out representing her musical perception at its best.&#8216;Marugelara' (Jayantasri), &#8216;Sreerangapuravihara' (Brindavanasaranga) and &#8216;Adukaradani' (Manoranjani) were the other items on her agenda.Nandini concluded her concert with a lilting Lalgudi t....................0.illana in Desh. Sreeranjani's violin accompaniment stayed close to the vocalist's interpretations in alapanas and swara sallies.Unnikrishnan's rhythmic beats on the mridangam were right on track including a vibrant thani.
