VA. RAMALINGA SASTRYPopular music sabha Sangeetha Kalaasamithi organised a vocal recital by young Kasturi Kamaladeepti at the Public Library, Visakhapatnam, last week. Marked with an aesthetic effort it fulfilled all norms of exposition of carnatic music in all its rich\u000aness and attracted applause from all sections of the audience including the critics. More fascinating was the almost comparable exposition oflayaon mridangam in his accompaniment amiably provided by nine-year-old Harsha from the US i\u000an the company of professionals M. Satyanarayana Sarma on violin and G. Venkatesh on morsing.Setting up an engaging mood from the word go tunefully starting withPranamamyaham (Goula)suffixed with crispswaram, Deepti evocatively renderedKamaakshiof Syamasastri (Begada) prefixed with brief but beautifulaalapana, Enthanerchina (Saveri)andSarasijanabhasodari (Naaga Gandhari)before she elaborately renderedPankajalochana (Kalyani)withaalapan\u000aaandswaram. Then after renderingNenaruncharaof Thyagaraja, she expansively expatiatedChakkani Rajamargamuof the same composer (Kharaharapriya).The knowledgeablethaniexecuted on mridangam by the little Harsha along with Venkatesh on morsing with felicitous charm delighted all alike. Sarma on violin contributed grandeur with his scholarly and subtle following. Guest of Hon\u000aour, AIR Station Director Prayaga Vedavathi presenting mementos was all praise for the artistes. Founder secretary of the Samithi and renowned mridangam vidwan V.V. Ramanamurty proposed a vote of thanks.Bottom Template Starts
