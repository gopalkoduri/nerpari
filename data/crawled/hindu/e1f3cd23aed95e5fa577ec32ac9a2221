VRamya Sarika, bestowed with a melodious voice, sang with seriousness and commitmentListening to young artistes\u000asinging in the traditional\u000amould is\u000arejoicing. The following\u000arecital brightened up such\u000aan expectation to a significant\u000adegree, notwithstanding\u000athe shortcomings.\u000aRamya Sarika sang at Ganabharathi\u000ain Mysore, accompanied\u000aby H.M. Smitha\u000a(violin) and Radhesh (mridanga).\u000aHer forte was clear\u000adiction and melodious\u000avoice, which were consistent\u000aeven in the higher octaves.\u000aHer well-planned\u000aconcert, was testimony to\u000aseriousness and\u000acommitment.She started with the varna,\u000a"Chalamela" of Thiruvottiyur\u000aThyagayya\u000a(Darbar), set to a pace faster\u000athan madhyamakala, for a\u000amoment making it seem all\u000aspeeded up, which in fact\u000awas proved otherwise, as\u000athe concert advanced: she\u000awas all-composed in the\u000arest of the concert, treading\u000amedium to moderate tempos,\u000aideal for maintaining\u000aclarity and mood. "Ananda\u000aNatanaprakasham" of\u000aDikshitar composed in Kedara\u000amay be quoted as a fitting\u000aexample for the\u000aconsistency of her voice and\u000asense of shruthi, exposing\u000aboth the shringara and veera\u000arasas of the raga.Nevertheless, "Aparadhamulanu"\u000a(Lathangi- Patnam\u000aSubrahmanya Iyer)\u000aprojected a different picture.The lyrical sections appeared\u000amore formal. Considering\u000athe gravity of the\u000acomposer's supplicating\u000atone, which warranted utmost\u000ainvolvement and expressions,\u000aparticularly at\u000a"Krupachesina", where she\u000aelaborated (neraval) the lyrics,\u000athe emotional content\u000ain her interpretations ran\u000ashort of the desired intensity.She could have added\u000amore meaningful airs as interlude\u000amovements, while\u000anarrating the lyrics. Moreover,\u000awith a slower tempo,\u000athe impact would have been\u000agreater.Detailed exposition of\u000a"Lokavana Chatura" (Begade-\u000aThyagaraja) and ragathana-\u000apallavi ("Saarasadala\u000aNayana" -Kaapi), comprised\u000aall the ingredients\u000anecessary to frame the body\u000aof any presentation. In general,\u000aone area that needed\u000aattention, particularly in\u000athe alapana sections, was a\u000anecessity for finer vocal\u000amodulations in order to materialise\u000athe raagabhaava\u000aimpressively.Further, the method of\u000araga exposition would have\u000aattracted better appreciation\u000ahad she followed a systematic\u000apattern in framing\u000athe swara phrases and the\u000asancharas in progressive\u000aincrements.Other highlights were\u000a"Raaka Shashivadana"\u000a(Takka-Thyagaraja), "Bhogindra\u000aShaayinam" (Kunthalavarali-\u000aSwathy\u000aThirunal) and "Jagadoddharana"\u000a(Kaapi- Purandaradasa).
