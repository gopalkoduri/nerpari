VT. K. GANAPATHYEndowed with a pleasant and pliablesaareeram, the teenaged girl, Aiswarya Vidya Raghunath attracted the sparse audience gathered at the Sree Ayyappan Puja Sangham, in her vocal concert held under the auspices of Manoranjitham, with her gana-naya, raga bhava, grasp over laya and a taste for traditional classicism.Filled with aplomb, her delivery and crisp rendition of the numbers revealed her gift of ready and felicitous expression even at the commencement of the "Neranammithi" varnam in Kaanada, followed by "Aanandanatamaaduvaar Thillai" in Purvikalyani, embellished with swaras.Aiswarya's  melodic heights in negotiating the contours of Mukhari in the raga alapana for the kirtana, "Arivaar Yaar Unnai" was soothing.The song itself was presented with a clear vision of its philosophical and spiritual value. "Ninnaada" in Kaanada was a relaxed exposition.Challenging compositionThe vocalist did justice to "Koluvaiyunnaade," a challenging composition. Her vidwat and vocal refinement in the delineation of Todi for the kriti, "Sree Krishnam Bhaja Maanasa" drew wide acclaim.However, the battery of swaras following the cluttered neraval was somewhat overstretched.Aiswarya's neat RTP exercise in Begada was executed well with raga sancharas in Sahana, Varali and Surutti.Her other items included, "Saravanabhava" (Shanmukhapriya) and "Madhava Maamava" in Neelambari.Kartik's spontaneity and lyrical softness were evident in the elegant portrayals of Mukhari, Todi and Begada on the violin.Erode Gururajan's tani bit delighted the listeners. With more practice, the budding artiste is destined to scale heights and go places.Bottom Template Starts
