VSeptuagenarian K.S.R. Balakrishna Sastry continues to be a crusader of classical Carnatic music, both as a performer and propagator. For that purpose he has been running an organisation named Saptaswara. Rarely did we miss Balakrishna Sastry in most of Balamuralikrishna&#8217;s concerts, for he is seated behind him. But he is also a direct disciple of well known vocalist and violin artiste Hari Nagabhushanam.Balakrishna Sastry&#8217;s concert at the mini theatre of Thyagaraya Gana Sabha reflected the quality and precision of Nagabhushanam and pleasing expression of Balamurali. His repertoire invariably had the numbers that Balamurali composed.  Balakrishna Sastry has an impressive vocal ability for good intonation and sahitya expression with right emotion, a trait of Balamurali.The repertoire was enough to reveal his vocal skills and knowledge.The opening varnamNadagopala Balain Gamanasrama was that of Hari Nagabhushanam and was quite brisk. Balamurali&#8217;sParipari nee Padamein Hamsdhwani was well-rendered, with its inbuilt technical arrangement of swarasahitya.Begada ragam came for extensive delineation. He presented in this Ramnad Srinivasa Iyengar&#8217;s rare numberAnudinamunu. He then went forVaranarada Narayanaof Thyagaraja in Vijayasri, followed byNada Tanumanisamin Chittharanjani. He used the final charanam of this as line for his swarakalpana. The showpiece number of the concert was a majestic Kalyani forVasudevayani. Kalyani was extensively dealt with and the swaram was built over the pallavi line.In the concluding partRadha Samethain Yaman was good.It was a well-orchestrated concert with violin by veteran Kokkonda Subrahmanya Sarma and three percussionists &#8211; K. Krishna Prasad (mridangam), T.P. Balasubramanyam (ghatam) and P.S. Gopalan (morsing).The violinist&#8217;s contribution went a long way in adding melodic appeal to the whole show.Scholars, led by veda pundit Naishadham Prabhakara Rao, blessed Balakrishna Sastry and presented him with citation with the titles of &#8216;Sangeetha Bruhaspati&#8217; and &#8216;Gana Bandhu&#8217;, keeping in view all his services to music as a performer, teacher and propagator.
