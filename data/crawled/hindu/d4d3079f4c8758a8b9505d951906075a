VVasundhara Performing Arts Centre had organised Parangathotsava for five days to reach the connoisseurs who longed for concerts of accomplished artistes of inspiring ability to set a trend for younger generations.On the inaugural day, Dr. Vasundhara Doraswamy presented Shakuntha Kujana . The theme centered on the romance between tapasvi (Vishwamitra) and an apsara (Menaka, the heavenly nymph).The opening scene being Kanva Ashrama, where Shakunthala grew up (daughter of Menaka and Vishwamitra), Vasundhara took the spectators to the lush environs of tretha yuga, which flourished on splendours of nature in the light of spiritual ambience.Descriptions incorporating pure dance sections, supported by virile solkattus-s by the nattuvanar, implanted a strong sense of delight into the scene. Inclusion of karana-s like katichinna karana, alaatha karana and the like transformed the series of well-set adavu-s into interesting and artistic angahara-s.Menaka through her romantic overtures ultimately succeeds in shattering the penance of Vishwamitra.The danseuse extempore realised the situation with minutest details thoroughly complemented by profound involvement and commitment. Her repertoire, which included yogic practices, came in handy to portray the spiritual ambience of the Ashram.From then on, the story delves into the emotional realm. Vociferous narration of the supporting script by Udyavara Madhavacharya grew in intensity with the increasing emotional fervour.This completely distracted the audience from enjoying any finer visual aspects.Moreover, the lyrics disproportionately exaggerated the circumstances. He could have avoided very frequent repetitions of the words garbha, basiru with rhetoric accentuations, and melodramatic exclamations of pity.The lyrics were extremely wordy. Further, the overall concept left the spectator drenched in a state of melancholy driving one to depression and frustration: a factor not in harmony with the ideologies and philosophy of Natyashastra.P. Rama (music composer and singer), Sandesh Bhargav (Natuvanar), Narayana (violin), Jayaram (flute), H.L. Shivashankaraswamy (mridanga) and Prasanna Kumar (rhythm pad) constituted the music ensemble.***On the second day, Suma Sudhindra presented a veena recital accompanied by B. Raghuram (violin), B.C. Manjunath (mridanga) and Narayana Murthy (ghata).Commendable control over the instrument facilitated constant emergence of melody. She adapted a method, which immediately established her as an artiste of repute and competence.For instance, the Kalyani varna (&#8220;Vanajakshi&#8221; - Ramnad Shrinivasa Iyengar). The progressions passed through different speeds with cross-rhythm effects, retaining purity of every note and clarity of the raga.Nevertheless, alapanas in Malayamarutha (&#8220;Manasa Yetulortune&#8221; - Thyagaraja) and Simhendramadhyama (&#8220;Ninne Nammithinayya&#8221; - Vasudevacharya) were mechanical and arid, though melodic. On the contrary, if one observed the method followed by the melody accompanist, it was evident that his interpretations of the ragas carried the sentimental shades more convincingly.&#8220;Mahaganapathim&#8221; (Nata-Dikshithar), &#8220;Nagumomu&#8221; (Abheri-Thyagaraja), Tillana (Sindhubhairavi - Lalgudi Jayaraman) and &#8220;Manavyalakim&#8221; (Nalinakanti-Thyagaraja) were other inclusions.
