VK. Srividhya &#8211; Carnatic classicalPrice not mentionedThe youngest member of the illustrious musical Trinity of South India who adorned the firmament in the 18th and 19th centuries was Muthuswami Dikshitar, who along with Syama Sastri and Tyagaraja shed immortal lustre on Carnatic music which started mo\u000aving along fresh channels ever since.Muthuswamy Dikshitar was a close follower of the Venkatamakhi tradition. His group kritis such as the Kamalamba navavarana, navagraha, nilotpalamba, vibhakti kritis and so on are perhaps the ultimate in devotional, musical, lyrical and laya excellence.The  salient features of his kritis are that he incorporated the complete details of the kshetra in the sahitya.His navagraha kritis on Surya, Chandra, Angaraka, Budha, Guru, Sukra, Saneeswara, Rahu and Kethu are outstanding classics spelling auspiciousness, prosperity and spirituality.K. Srividhya, a young artiste with a good, high pitched voice, has rendered the Navagraha kritis, the programme beginning with an invocatory song in Bilahari on Ganesha. &#8216;Suryamruthe&#8217; in Sowrashtram, &#8216;Chandram Bhaja&#8217; in Asaveri, &#8216;Angarakam&#8217; in Surutti, &#8216;Budhamasrayami&#8217; in Nattakuranji, &#8216;Bruhaspathe&#8217; in Atana, &#8216;Sri Sukra&#8217; in Paraju, &#8216;Divakaratanujam&#8217; in Yadhukula Khambodi, &#8216;Smaramyaham&#8217; in Ramaamanohari (according to Dikshitar nomenclature) and &#8216;Mahasuram&#8217; in Chamaram or Shanmukhapriya are all sung with adequate fervour and involvement.More care on the sahitya expression and a firm grip on the lyrical articulation would go a long way in enhancing  the quality of presentation. Nonetheless, the album is a commendable effort.Lavanya Raman, the violinist and S.J.Arjun Ganesh, the mridangist, provide quiet, dignified accompanying support to the whole programme.
