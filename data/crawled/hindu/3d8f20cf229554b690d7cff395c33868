VThis attakatha is taught to students immediately after the customary Purappad. But with the institutionalisation of art forms, new methodologies order and curriculum came into existence and as a result, some of the older practices went into oblivion. This was the case of this play too.According to Unnikrishnan, &#8216;Gurudakshina&#8217; was last performed  some two decades ago at Irinjalakuda, in which he was a participant. Luckily an audio cassette of that performance was available with M.K. Aniyan, a connoisseur of Kathakali, and that led to the release of a CD.The padams are tuned simply in common ragas.  Ragas like Dwijavanthi appear in a raagamalika and certain padams in ragas  Kalyaani, Madhyamaavathi, Kappi and Poorvikalyaani  show marked resemblances with popular padams of other plays in similar ragas. The late Kalamandalam Raveendran is the other singer along with Unnikrishnan.  Kalanilayam Kunjunni plays the chenda and Kalamandalam Eswara Warrier handles the maddhalam.By Kalanilayam Unnikrishnan and Late Kalamandalam RaveendranRs. 100
