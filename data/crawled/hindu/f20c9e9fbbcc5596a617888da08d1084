VThe connoisseurs of Hindustani Classical Instrumental music in Bangalore recently had the rare opportunity of listening to two exquisite instrumental solo recitals by Pt Brij Narayan and Harsh Narayan, a father and son pair who were accompanied by tabla maestros Pandit Anindoo Chatterjee and Pt Ravindra Yawagal respectively at Smriti Nandan cultural centre.Harsh Narayan is the talented young grandson of the legendary sarangi maestro Pandit Ram Narayan. Also, the son of the sarod maestro Pandit Brij Narayan, Harsh Narayan has emerged as one of the eminent contemporary sarangi artistes of India. Recently his sarangi recital at the Commonwealth Games programme in Delhi received critical acclaim and applause.Harsh Narayan commenced his Sarangi recital with the enchanting melody raga Patdeep affiliated to &#8220;Kafi That&#8221; . The musical possibilities that were unleashed by the sarangi were discernible in the &#8220;alaap&#8221; and &#8220; vilambit&#8221; sections. Harsh's &#8220;raagvistar&#8221; in the &#8220;vilambit teental gat&#8221; of the plaintive melody &#8216;Patdeep' conveyed ample depth of feeling.His multi-layered, textured &#8220;alap&#8221; which focused on the &#8220;badhat&#8221; of the raga in incremental progression added to the his presentation. His supple &#8216;meends and ghasitas' were graceful.In the faster &#8220;drut teen tal&#8221; composition , his dazzling, racy &#8216;taans' had remarkable clarity. The tabla accompaniment by renowned tabla virtuoso Pt Ravindra Yawagal greatly enhanced the aesthetic appeal of Harsh Narayan's sarangi recital.This was followed by the sarod recital of Pandit Brij Narayan , the eldest son of Pandit Ram Narayan who was accompanied by one of India's greatest tabla maestros Pandit Anindo Chatterjee. Brij Narayan has skilfully adapted his father Ram Narayan's special technique of holding a bow to a plectrum instrument. It is through this gifted ability that Brij Narayan is able to bring forth such tremendous originality to the music he creates. Pandit Brij Narayan began his recital with alap-jod-jhala in raga Shree, a &#8220;sandhiprakash&#8221; raga of the twilight. His &#8216;alap' in the &#8216;mandra sthayi' or the lower register of the raga was characterised by a soothing sense of meditative reposefulness. The &#8220;nyasa&#8221; on the note &#8220;rishabh&#8221; had a hauntingly beautiful quality. The sombre alap section in this raga was followed by &#8220;jod&#8221; in which Brij Narayan resorted to a series of pulsations, playing the permutations of notes in raga Shree in a rhythmic manner. The speed of playing also quickened conspicuously to double the tempo of the previous section. &#8220;Jod&#8221; culminated in the &#8220;jhala&#8221; wherein the artiste maintained a rapid and constant pulsation using the high pitched &#8220;chikari&#8221; strings which created a sense of scintillating incantatory sound. His presentation was compellingly reminiscent of the style of Sarod maestro Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. In a rather surprising and unusual move, Brij Narayan abruptly chose to conclude his presentation of raga Shree without taking up a &#8216;Gat' composition and embarked on a euphonious delineation of another beautiful raga &#8220;Gawati&#8221;. His exploration of the raga in vilambit teen tal gat section was a veritable lyrical rhapsody that touched the hearts of the audience. The electrifying and resonant &#8220;tihayis&#8221; of Pt Anindo Chatterjee on the tabla were in astounding synchrony with the resplendant &#8216;sangathis' in raga &#8216;Gawati', thereby producing ripples of ecstacy and excitement in the audience. Brij Narayan concluded his recital with a drut teen tal composition in the popular melody &#8220;Mishra Piloo&#8221;.His rendition of &#8220;Piloo&#8221; was a testimony to the creative resourcefulness and innovativeness of his artistry. Brij Narayan exploited the fullest potentialities of the myriad hues of this amazing raga of 12 notes, weaving a magical spell of &#8220;avirbhav- tirobhav sanchars&#8221; into some of the obscure and untouched dimensions of this raga, in his inimitable style which was a remarkable fusion of multitudinous aspects of great command of tonality, soulful imaginative quality in the melodic structure and improvisation in rhythm.
