He also obtained B.Sc., B.A. and B.Ed degrees.Even while working as a graduate science assistant in the Municipal High School in Vizianagaram, he achieved the distinction of being a choicest accompanist on mridangam to stalwart exponents of classical, vocal and instrumental music like D.K. Pattammal, Nedunuri, Sandhyavandanam Srinivasa Rao, Dwaram Venkataswami Naidu, Eemani, and Prapancham Sitaram to name a few.He became a guru in great demand and scores of his students including his son (V.V. Ramanamurty, an AIR artiste and its staffer) today enjoy the privilege of being valued accompanists and teachers in music schools and colleges.He resigned his job as a teacher to join AIR and adorned its studios in Visakhapatnam as a staff artiste for 16 years from 1975.An evocative exponent and composer of devotional music even at the age past 75, he gets drafted by AIR and musicsabhasall over South Inddia to organiselayavinyasams.The grand finale of the function lay in the recital of compositions of Purandhara Dasa in the regular concert format by Manda Sudharani in the company of Ch.
