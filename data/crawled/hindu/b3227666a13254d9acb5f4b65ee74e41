VKalabharati witnessed an engrossing carnatic music recital last Saturday. Initiated as an annual feature and under the aegis of Visakha Music and Dance Academy by Tatha Suryakantham in memory of her daughter Mukkamala Satyavathi, who was an ardent follower of carnatic music, it was organised by the academy.Well known vocalist Manda Sudharani, no wonder, was the choice to render the first memorial concert along with her 16-year-old daughter Ravali on violin and young Manda Kalyani (MCA student) on mridangam. Both Ravali, who is a vocalist of high promise, and Kalyani who mastered the art under the tutelage of her father M. Ramakrishna Prasad who himself was a disciple of the renowned mridangam player Dandamudi Ramamohana Rao, in their following and turns turned out to be exquisite showcases of mettle.Sudharani, going erudite as usual, made her exposition technically an engaging exercise. After starting withGirirajasutha Tanayaof Thyagaraja (Bangala), she rendered the Vaggeyakara&#8217;sPancharatnakritiin Aarabhi andAnupamagunaambudhi(Athana) interspersed with a composition inMalayamaruthambefore she eruditely elaboratedKasivisaalakshiof Dikshitar (Gamaka kriya &#8212; Sampoorna Suvaadi Melakarta also known as Gamanasrama) with theswarakalpanainGathibedham.After renderingBhajaregopalam(Hindolam), she came out with an equally scholarly expatiation ofChakkanirajamargamu(Kharaharapriya). She concluded singingBruhimukundethi(Kuranji),Gandhapupooyaruga(Punnagavarali) etc., ending up with a composition in Surati.Sudharani was felicitated on the occasion by Sangeethajanakula Kulapathi Sriman I.V.L. Sastry before beginning the recital, while the trustee of the academy, G.R.K. Prasad introduced her and the other artistes.A.R.S
