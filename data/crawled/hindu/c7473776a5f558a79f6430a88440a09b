VShe sings with an &#8216;open&#8217; voice, the range of which is appreciable enough to realise her manodharma and expressions to a reasonable extent. The general approach is assertive carrying with it a tone of authority. Nevertheless, the concert would have been more convincing had the artiste modulated her voice for appealing succulent timbre.&#8220;Karunimpa&#8221; (Varna - Shahana - Thiruvottiyur Thyagayya), built on deep graces and terse rhythm structure vivified the beginning. Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Shri Ganapathi Ni&#8221; (Saurashtra) also admirably fitted into her style. Clearly suggestive introductory alapana, emphatic lyrical recital and fine articulations in the taara sthayi (&#8220;Vinayamunanu&#8221;) amply reflected her vocal ability.Compare between &#8220;Intha Kannaanandamemi&#8221; (Bilahari - Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Raagarathnamaalika Che&#8221; (Rithigaula - Thyagaraja): As Bilahari is more accommodative, with relatively wider latitude, an expatiation conforming to general guidelines somehow evokes one rasa or the other. On the other hand, Rithigaula needs particular mindset with very soft intonations to bring out the Karuna Rasa, and therefore is more demanding and restrictive. On these grounds, the artiste was more impressive in Bilahari than in Rithigaula.She was neat and scholarly in narrating lyrics by following an appropriate tempo, though it could have done with some  polished touches. Swara prasthara in Bilahari needed better attention to swarasthanas. K. Sathyanarayana&#8217;s keyboard recital at the same venue held the audience under its sway. The young boy exhibited an astounding control over the instrument, and steered himself through the melodic movements and terse layas with dexterity and ease, far beyond one expected of his age.&#8220;Gajavadana Beduve&#8221; (Hamsadhwani - Purandaradasa) and &#8220;Guruleka Etuvanti&#8221; (Gowrimanohari - Thyagaraja) followed by a few passages of kalpanaswaras provided a good start. Swara prasthara in Gowrimanohari enriched the raga than the lyrics. He elicited deep graces in Bhairavi exposing the nuances of the swara phrases in relation to their locations on the scale. Liberal usage of portamenti enriched the mood in &#8220;Odibaarayya Vaikuntapathi&#8221; (Purandaradasa).&#8220;Kandu Kandu&#8221; (Des) was another pleasing and absorbing presentation. &#8220;Shiva Shiva Shiva Enaraada&#8221; (Panthuvarali -Thyagaraja) conformed to technical specifications. Incorporating special chord effects, he created an atmosphere of wonder. The lyrics could have been grand in a relatively slower tempo, and one wished that the swaraprastara enriched the mood embedded in those lyrics.The focus of the concert was &#8220;Birana Brova&#8221; (Kalyani &#8211; Tharangapadhi Panchanatha Iyer) comprising an elaborate alapana, neraval and swaraprastara (Rasikapriya - Mohana and Charukeshi).The passages carried attractive marcatos (special technique of attacking the notes as in violin) and staccatos, culminating in an interesting thaniyavarthana.G. Rajesh (violin- could have done much better had he maintained the same emotive performance as he did in Charukeshi), G.S. Ramanujan (mridanga) and V.S. Ramesh (ghata - both percussionists were consistent throughout) accompanied the artiste.&#8220;Ninuvina&#8221; (Navarasa Kannada-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Thamburimitidava&#8221; (Sindhubhairavi - Purandaradasa - with melodic swings) were some of the other inclusions.
