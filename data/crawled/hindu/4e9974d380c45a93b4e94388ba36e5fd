VIt was a grand musical celebration as Rasikapriya Sabha celebrated its 33rd anniversary.Mathangi Sathyamurthy began  the celebrations with a fine display of her grip over laya and vocals. The concert, which started off with a Sriraga varnam and proceeded on to a ragam tanam pallavi towards the final phase, had never a dull moment.Ananda Bhairavi was unfurled with its swaroopa revealed  from the first phrase itself. The alapana was enriched with wonderful modulations.Shyama Sastri&#8217;s composition &#8216;Marivere dikkevaru&#8217; in Misra chapu tala was sung at a controlled pace. In contrast, the Bilahari composition &#8216;Paritanameerchite&#8217; in Jhampa tala was a racy rendition. Njanjil Arun on the mridangam supported the vocalist well during this phase of the concert.Mathangi&#8217;s raga exposition of Shanmukhapriya was power-packed with amazing &#8216;karuvais&#8217; and long phrases. Her ability to glide through lower and higher octaves was commendable. Thiruvizha Viju S. Anand on the violin provided the vocalist able support. Thrikkakara Shantaram (ganjira) and Srijith (ghatom) were the other supporting artistes.Ranganatha Sharma&#8217;s  Ada tala varnam &#8216;Neranammi&#8217; engaged the audience&#8217;s attention right from the start. Ambi Dikshithar&#8217;s &#8216;Gananathaya namaste&#8217; in Goula raga proved to be an excellent choice too. Intricate swara passages embellished &#8216;Chararavathe&#8217; in Reethigoula.The rare composition &#8216;Pattividuvaradura&#8217; in Manjari raga was well delineated. Sharma&#8217;s Varali alapana brought out the richness and distinct Carnatic flavour of the raga. The Shyama Sastri composition &#8216;Kamakshi Bangaru&#8217; was noteworthy for its wonderful kalapramana in misra chappu tala.After &#8216;Nadaloludai&#8217; in Kalyanavasantham, Sharma gave a chromatic sketch of Sankarabharanam with alapalana in three layas. The famed composition &#8216;Swararaga sudha&#8217; and its kalpanaswaras sparkled with a detailed mukthaippu.The vocalist took up a ragam tanam pallavi in Vrindavanasaranga set to Khandajati Triputa tala. The highlight of this piece was the ragamalika swaras in Ananda Bhairavi, Hamsanandi and Kedara Gowla. Edapally Ajith (violin) provided the vocalist excellent support for this piece.The lighter pieces were &#8216;Enna Tavam Sheidane&#8217; (Kapi), &#8216;Venkatachalanilayam&#8217; (Sindhubhairavi) and a Lalgudi tillana in Pahadi. The tani by Thrissur Jayakrishnan on the mridangam and Tripunithura N. Gopalakrishnan on the ganjira was delectable.The Annamacharya Day Celebration was organised jointly with Andhra Cultural Association. The vocal concert by Y. Ramaprabha was good in parts.Her reverence for Annamacharya compositions was evident in her wide selection of the saint&#8217;s compositions. &#8216;Purushothamudaneevu&#8217; in Bowli raga and Khanda chappu tala gave the recital a sombre mood. The other Annamayya compositions rendered in the concert were &#8216;Chakkani thalli&#8217; in raga Paadi and &#8216;Muddugare Yashoda&#8217; in Kurinji.The vocalist gave a pleasant exposition of raga Vasantha followed by the composition &#8216;Neevata Venkatadri Daivamu.&#8217;  &#8216;Rama ramakrishna&#8217; in Kalyani raga was expanded and presented well.
