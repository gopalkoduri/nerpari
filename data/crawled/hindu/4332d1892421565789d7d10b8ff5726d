VUstad Asad Ali Khan is the last surviving exponent of Khandar Bani, one of the four schools of Dhrupad, and the undisputed maestro of the Jaipur Beenkar gharana. His family tradition goes back seven generations into the 18th Century when his ancestors were royal musicians at the princely court of Jaipur. His great grandfather, the legendary Ustad Rajab Ali Khan, and grandfather Ustad Musharraf Ali Khan, were the famousbeenplayers in the court of Alwar. Rigorously trained under his father, Ustad Sadique Ali Khan in the Rudra veena and vocal, Ustad Asad Ali Khan has command over not only the exacting technique of this demanding instrument but also the intricate shruti-bheda of the particular swaras used in different ragas.To document his historic  contribution and amazing artistry in playing Rudra veena, Suroor Films recently organised amehfilof morning ragas  for an invited audience at the residence of the film director Renuka George in New Delhi. The audience comprised ustads like Fahimuddin Dagar, Ghulam Sadique Khan, Pandit L.K. Pandit, Malti Gilani, Uma Sharma, Uma Vasudev and many more music connoisseurs who inspired Ustad Asad Ali Khan. The ustad was in his element when he opened the concert with raga Todi. Since this raga omits the Pancham which is used in Mian Ki Todi, it is also known as  Gurjari Todi.The opening statement itself underlined the ethos of the raga when Khan saheb took a deep meend from the teevra Madhyam of the lower octave to the Shadja. The komal Rishabh, caressed by komal Gandhar, and the gradually progressing meends from mandra Dhaivat to komal Rishabh, komal Gandhaar and teevra Madhyam, et al, resonated with the accurate shrutis to determine the raga. The detailed alap-jod was followed by a composition set to the 10-beat cycle of Sool tala in medium tempo, where he deployed the gamak taans as well, accompanied on the pakhawaj by Pandit Mohan Shyam Sharma.By the time he rounded off Todi with a crystal clear jhala, it was  time for the Sarang group of ragas. He opted for Shuddha Sarang first, inviting the audience to focus their attention on the specific use of the Dhaivat swara. He also reminded the discerning audience of the famous composition of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, &#8220;Begi darasava&#8221; where he has beautifully used the forbidden Dhaivat in the  ascending scale, in the taan &#8220;Ma Pa Dha Ni Sa&#8221;.The composition in this raga was also set to the 10-beat cycle where Mohan Shyam reciprocated the Rudra veena&#8217;s &#8220;Ma Pa Sa&#8221; with an open endedthhaapon his pakhawaj that was tuned to  taar Shadja. Madhmad Sarang was the other variety of Sarang that he chose to play thereafter. It was a rare opportunity not only to listen to the morning ragas but also to enjoy a close rapport with the ustad who enlightened his listeners with information like how Amir Khusrau composed the sul fakhta tala based on the utterance of the fakhta bird that made the rhythmic sound of two plus three.
