VGanesh and Kumaresh will perform at New Delhi&#8217;s Andhra Pradesh Bhawan on April 20.&#8220;That is where all the values help &#8212; the yoga, etc.,&#8221; says Kumaresh. &#8220;Music opens up all the seven chakras of your body. It calms you, keeps you in a good state of mind. It helps you because, when you perform you energise. And the way our Carnatic system has been formed, it helps you not to get distracted. Say you are performing a raga alap. People might be coming in and going out of the hall. Normally you would be distracted. But since you are engrossed in the alap, the focus you have in performing music is so intense, you don&#8217;t.&#8221;He continues, &#8220;Music is called nada yoga. Even when we travel, we will be thinking about a raga, how the note travels from one place to another. It is a yoga in a way. You do the performance in your mind, and it is a very meditative part of the upasana. We might be thinking of some korvai (rhythmic pattern of notes), and it will keep us involved for hours.&#8221;Their initial &#8220;tapas&#8221; was done when they were under the training of their father Rajagopalan at home, admit the brothers, who were recently honoured as Asthana Vidwans of the Andavan Ashramam of Srirangam.The booming Carnatic music industry is a matter of satisfaction. &#8220;There is a lot of interest, lot of new people. That&#8217;s wonderful,&#8221; remarks Kumaresh. &#8220;Carnatic music is in the best state today. &#8221;In the golden era of musicians like GNB and others, he points out, limited entertainment options made getting audiences easier. &#8220;TV had a very big impact on Carnatic music. Now, many people are coming back. It could be because people are getting bored of TV. But also, youngsters today want to connect to the art form. They not only want to listen to music, they also want to understand &#8212; what is the raga, what is the melakarta, who is the composer, and such things. That inquisitiveness has enhanced the audience.&#8221;Today&#8217;s performers are &#8220;responsible&#8221; and package their concerts well. &#8220;They like to do a story behind the concert, or they might make it an Ambal-based or a kshetra-based concert. They are all very young. They bring in a new dimension. That also helps,&#8221; he says.For their part, the brothers, known for their matchless synergy, have formulated &#8216;Ragapravaham&#8217;, a format for instrumental music. The basic concept, explains Ganesh, is to balance the melodic and rhythmic aspects of instrumental music. Also, he says, when vocal compositions, especially the kritis of Carnatic music, are played on an instrument, &#8220;even when we announce the kriti, after a while, 99 per cent of the audience doesn&#8217;t know the lyrics. But the tune is popular.&#8221; Therefore, instead of creating more kritis, the brothers composed set pieces for the violin. These can be played with or without added improvisation. The genesis of these compositions was in the swara passages (chittaswarams) Ganesh first began composing, playing with three octaves instead of the conventional format. &#8220;These chittaswarams were kind of the basis for Ragapravaham. For a lot of people it is very new,&#8221; he says.But to say music is evolving is wrong, asserts Kumaresh. &#8220;It is already evolved. Nobody can say they understand music. And every musician finds his vision of music and devises a way to present it the way he wants to. Madurai Mani had it, GNB had it, before that Tyagaraja had it. It is a very important aspect of our culture.&#8221;Therefore, he says, to worry that a changed lifestyle would cause music to lose its essential nature is a baseless fear.
