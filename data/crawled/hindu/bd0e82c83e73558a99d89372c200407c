VThe concluding function of the Delhi International Arts Festival attracted a committed audience of ghazal listeners, some not even born when the likes of Penaz Masani, Talat Aziz and Bhupinder Singh were making waves during their formative years as si\u000angers of note.The Town Hall came alive with some enchanting singing by four of the finest ghazal exponents in contemporary music.The petite Penaz, the graceful Aziz and the fabulous duo of Bhupinder-Mitali combined to produce a memorable evening for music lovers, who earned praise from the artists too for their appreciation of the nuances of ghazal.Presented as the signature festival for Delhi, the event did capture the poetic significance of ghazal singing.Penaz set the trend with an impeccable rendering of Begum Akhtar&#8217;s immortal &#8220;Koi Ye Kehde Gulshan Gulshan&#8221;. A self-confessed fan of Shakeel Badayuni, she left the audience spellbound with &#8220;Meri Zindagi Hai Zaalim Tere Gham Se Aashikara&#8221;.Penaz signed off with Ghalib&#8217;s &#8220;Dil-e-Nadaan Tujhe Hua Kya Hai&#8221;.The stage was set for Aziz, the genial Hyderabadi, to take charge. The softly-spoken Aziz, with a voice that suits ghazal singing, lost no time in settling down and capturing the mood of the occasion with some soulful numbers.&#8220;Kaise Sukoon Paaun Tujhe Dekhne Ke Baad&#8221; was an early indication of Aziz&#8217;s preparation for the evening. He warmed up with &#8220;Zindagi Jab Bhi Teri Bazm Me Laati Hai Hame&#8221; from &#8220;Bazaar&#8221; and moved on to &#8220;Jo Massarato Me Khalish Hai&#8221;.Aziz was in splendid form and left the gathering in a trance with &#8220;Chahenge Tujhe Par Kabhi Rusvaa Naa Karange&#8221;, prompting a 20-year-old music student from the Delhi University to touch his feet.Aziz, moved by the gesture, confessed, &#8220;This is proof that melody is alive in today&#8217;s society. Ghazal has a special place in the world of music and occasions like this encourage us to give our best. For an artist, there is no greater joy than getting an immediate response from the listener. It only conveys the genuine warmth for this kind of music.&#8221;Aziz&#8217;s choice of ghazals came from his trusted reading of the gathering. &#8220;I never come with a preconceived list. I try and judge the mood of the audience with eye contact.I can make out if the audience appreciates the tune, the lyrics or the rendering.&#8221; He made a passionate appeal for more such festivals. &#8220;They are important for keeping our heritage and culture alive.&#8221;The audience had grown and it was night, just the time for Bhupinder and Mitali to take their fans on a nostalgic trip. Bhupinder refreshed memory of many in the audience who grew up admiring his soft and mellifluous voice, not to forget the honeyed support from Mitali.It was an emotional evening for his fans as Bhupinder pampered them with some select and some request numbers.He evoked a thundering applause when he ordered off all the cameramen who had been blocking the view of the gathering. &#8220;I want to see my listeners. Please move away,&#8221; boomed Bhupinder even as Mitali opening with a delightful &#8220;Rahon Pe Nazar Rakhna Hoton Pe Dua Rakhna&#8221;.&#8220;We are because of our audience. I interact with them to understand their mood and what they expect,&#8221; Bhupinder was to say later.He set the tone with &#8220;Dil Dhoondta Hai Phir Wohi Fursat Ke Raat Din&#8221; from &#8220;Mausam&#8221;. &#8220;Gulzar saab and Pancham (RD Burman) have been very dear to me,&#8221; announced an emotional Bhupinder.At 68 Bhupinder could still relive the magic of his &#8220;Hoke Majboor Mujhe Usne Bulaya Hoga&#8221; from &#8220;Haqeeqat&#8221; (1964).It was captivating stuff as Bhupinder sang &#8220;Zindagi, Zindagi Mere Ghar Aana&#8221;, an unforgettable composition by Jaidev and moved on to &#8220;Beeti Naa Bitai Raina&#8221;.More requests followed and Bhupinder-Mitali obliged until the audience was politely reminded of regulations regarding use of loudspeakers beyond 11 p.m.Bhupinder was mobbed even as he profusely thanked his fans. It was a moment to cherish for Pratibha Prahlad, the force behind this venture.&#8220;I&#8217;m happy with the response. The setting was perfect and reflected on the state of ghazal singing. Such festivals allow art to flower.&#8221; She promises to make it an annual affair. The wait would be worthy indeed!
