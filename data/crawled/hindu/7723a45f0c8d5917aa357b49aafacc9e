VIn general, no exclusively Swati Tirunal kirtana session starts without the Mayamalavagowla song, &#8216;Deva Deva Kalayami&#8217; and Sangita Sivakumar meticulously observed this tradition. Of course, the song so well nurtured by top musicians, gives a kick start to a performance. With the generous support extended by the violinist V.V.S.Murari, mridangam vidwan Shertalai Anantakrishnan and kanjira artiste B.S.Purushottaman, the interpretation of the song was marked by cordiality.This team co-operation was the hallmark of the rest of the performance. &#8216;Narasimha Maamava&#8217; &#8212; Arabhi raga and song &#8212; was rendered with vividness and consistency. All the essential elements of the raga, its sparkle and range, were well brought out.Commitment to do justice to Swati Tirunal kirtanas was evident. The way she interpreted the Hamirkalyani item, &#8216;Gangeyavasana,&#8217; in slow tempo transferred her musical instincts to its solid graces. There was also a good mix of the madhyama and durita kala fixation to make the recital balanced. Before the Hamirkalyani piece Sangita presented &#8216;Gopanandana&#8217; (Bhushavali) and &#8216;Narasimha&#8217; (Arabhi). Similarly, preceding the main Thodi &#8216;Sarasija Naabha&#8217; was &#8216;Bogindrasayinam&#8217; (Kuntalavarali).Not being just a run of sancharas, the Thodi alapana development focussed on lucidity free from vocal extravagances. Felicitous distinction of the raga drew her attention.With very good control of the thick and thin of bowing, the raga vistaras in the solo sessions of Murari were calm and controlled. His creative process captured the pattern at the performing musician&#8217;s level. The percussion artistes were intensely vigorous but all the same highly decibel-conscious. Harmony of tekas and pharans was pertinently stressed according to the pace of the sangatis in songs.
