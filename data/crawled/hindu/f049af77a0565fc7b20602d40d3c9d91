V&#8220;It all began when my father decided that a naughty seven year old couldn&#8217;t be left home alone!&#8221; said Manjunath. Although his father had tried hard to get him into Carnatic music, Manjunath showed no interest.Once Manjunath was forced to accompany his father and brother Nagaraj for a show.His father made him sit on the stage. Towards the end of the concert the organisers garlanded the artistes. Manjunath tried to tell his father that he did not have a garland. The good-natured organiser announced that if he played the violin, he would get two garlands. While everyone laughed, Manjunath was annoyed. On returning home, Manjunath asked his father to teach him music. Within a year he got two garlands. While Manjunath was content, his father wouldn&#8217;t stop him there.Father and guru Mahadevappa aspired to make his sons violinists of national calibre. He honed their talent through severe practice regimens. &#8220;My father believed kids were to be killed when they played wrong. We sometimes got angry with our father, because of his ways, but the credit for whatever we are goes to him.&#8221;Nagaraj and Manjunath today, undoubtedly stand out as one of the top violinists of national and international repute.Religiosity and Carnatic music are tightly intertwined, with the lyrics of a vast majority of the compositions based on Hindu gods and goddesses. Does that necessitate one to be a believer? He explains that this nature of Carnatic music might have restricted its popularity in one sense. On the flip side, he points out that the major chunk of manodharma sangeetha has religion-neutral lyrics or no lyrics at all.In that respect, he says, Carnatic music throws itself open to be seen as purely an art form, a piece of melody or notes strung together, over and beyond lyrics. This, he believes is the ultimate musical experience, and calls for a lot of maturity to transcend to that zone.&#8220;I can never imagine a classical musician planting a bomb somewhere, even in our times!&#8221; he says, illustrating the point that classical music imparts richness of tradition, teaches discipline and most importantly, guides one to live well. Perception of the boundaries of classicism in Carnatic music has been a long debated subject matter. Is he a purist? &#8216;Yes and No!&#8217; he says. A sense of wise discretion marks the nature of his versatility.&#8220;When I play at Gayana Samaja or Music Academy, then yes, I am a purist. On the international stage, I can&#8217;t afford to be one,&#8221; he says.As a representative of Carnatic music on an international stage while performing with musicians of western genres, he says situations such as changing tempos and notes going off scale, which are almost an anathema to Carnatic music, arise quite often. During such instances, he says, &#8220;putting my foot down and refusing to play would only mean defeat for a Carnatic musician, and the form, ultimately&#8221;.With his prolific performance, and rich experience with various artistes, right from the top-notch Carnatic maestros to jazz and rock violinists from all over the world, he has his clear notions of what makes a good team on stage. &#8220;It is first about respect. Time sense and sense of proportion are very important. It is about understanding that the audience is here to listen to some wonderful music and not witness a fight between different musicians! When this is known well, it makes for a good team. It is ultimately about the perception and principles one has about music,&#8221; he says.A combination of hard work and fortune is what he calls a boon. In his performance as an accompanist and a duet concert performer with Nagaraj, he has exhausted playing at almost all the top prestigious sabhas in India, at the Sidney Opera House, the International Violin Conference at Sandiego and many more unique venues. &#8220;People ask us so very often, how we practice at home, and what helps us play like the way we do. There are answers only to a certain extent.Beyond that, we simply don&#8217;t know!&#8221; he says. A typical music-packed day in his life today involves spending some time with the violin in the morning, guiding Ph.D. students at the Mysore University, going for a concert, and meeting people.  What drives him up to greater heights? &#8220;The garland!&#8221;
