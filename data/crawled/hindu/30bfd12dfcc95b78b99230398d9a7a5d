VCarnatic music can sound deceptively simple when rendered by some musicians, but their straight forward approach without yielding to temptation to offer something flashy and to maintain the dignity of classical music is achieved through hard work and serious listening to the music of past and present artists.Bhagyalakshmi Suresh has rendered nine compositions commencing with a Ganapati invocatory song and concluding with a thillana in the compact audio disc brought out by Kalavardhani, Revathi Enterprises.Apt choiceThe popular Hamsadhwani creation of G.N. Balasubramanian &#8216;Vara Vallabha Ramana' serves as an apt starter. Syama Sastri's 'Pahimam Sri Raja Rajeswari ' in Nattai has, over the recent years, caught the fancy of many vocalists and is heard fairly frequently in the concert arena. Bhagyalakshmi's rendering draws the attention of the listener.The kalpanaswaras rendered at the sahitya point &#8216;Sarasa Pada Yugale' are catchy and the poruthams are reflective of the maturity of the singer.Two compositions of Alathur Vijayakumar find a place in this album. &#8216;Rama Rama' (Khamas) and &#8216;Yendudaginavo' in a rag mentioned as Balamurali are the songs. The raga christened &#8216;Balamurali' sports the scale of Mohanam in the Arohanam and has the notes &#8216;S D P G R S R G S' in the Avarohanam. The lower gandhara swara is the additional one in the descent.Periaswamy Thooran's &#8216;Muruga Muruga' (Saveri) and &#8216;Sri Sankara Guruvaram' (Nagaswaravali) of Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan are sedate versions.A convincing alapana of Shanmukhapriya followed with the evergreen &#8216;Marivere' of Patnam Subramania Iyer has niraval and swaras at the customary &#8216;Sannuthanga Sri.'&#8216;Manave Manthralaya' (ragamalika-Padmacharan) and a tillana in Purvi (Thirugokarnam Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar) round up the fare offered in this recording.The accompanists, Kovai S. Chandra (violin) and Trivandrum N. Hariharan (mridangam), have performed with enthusiasm.
