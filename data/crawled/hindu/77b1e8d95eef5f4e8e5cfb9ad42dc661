VAmong some of the excellent performances that this year&#8217;s IIC Experience offered  was the Hindustani classical vocal recital by Bhuvanesh Komkali. This gifted disciple of Vasundhara Komkali and Madhup Mudgal heralded the evening performances on the inaugural day, with his soulful rendering of the Narmada-Ashtak and other interesting compositions relating to the festival&#8217;s theme of &#8216;river&#8217;. The melodious strains of Yaman, the most appropriate raga for the evening, created mesmerising magic from the very beginning. The popular chota khayal &#8220;Kinaare kinaare dariya&#8230;&#8221; that followed the leisurely rendering of the vilambit khayal gave a refreshing sense of wonder with the varying stress on different beats of the mukhra. The bandishi thumri &#8220;Main kaise bharoo paani&#8230;&#8221; in raga Kafi and Deepchandi theka came next, followed by a rhythmic tarana in the same raga. Bhuvanesh concluded his recital with a nirgun bhajan, &#8220;Mori nike nike chaalan laagi naiya&#8230;&#8221;, which reminded music lovers of his grandfather, the legendary Kumar Gandharva.Vocalist Purnima Chaudhuri brought the music of Benaras for the morning concert. She gave a real treat of the purab ang gayaki in her riveting renditions of thumri, dadra, chaiti, kajri, et al, typical of this region. Opening her recital with an invocation to the Ganga in raga Bhairavi, she treated it as a full-fledged thumri with bol-banaav and the concluding laggi. Next came a traditional dadra relating to the Yamuna in &#8220;Akeli jin jaiyo Radhe Jamuna ke teer&#8221; with its lilting gait, followed by the contrasting intricacies of a tappa, also in Bhairavi. She also rendered some verses from the Ganga-Stotra of Adi Shankaracharya before offering the feast of chaiti and kajri, both Benarasi and Mirzapuri varieties. Ujjwal Prasad on the tabla and Deboprasad Dey on the harmonium accompanied her with full gusto.The Akashvani Sangeet Sammelan-2009, organised by All India Radio at the FICCI auditorium, presented a sonorous sarod recital by Buddhadeb Dasgupta. The veteran has sustained in his sarod the authentic style of his mentor Radhika Mohan Moitra which has become a rare phenomenon in the present era of loud music. He played a detailed alap-jod-jhala in raga Chhaya followed by a vilambit, a madhya-laya and a drut composition set to Teen tala. Next came Kafi-Kanhara with the same elegance, before he concluded his recital with a few rare compositions in raga Desh. He was supported very sensitively on the tabla by Nayan Ghosh, himself a very talented sitar player. Gifted son and disciple of Nikhil Ghosh, Nayan accompanied the sarod maestro with reverence and a feel for his meditative music.
