V&#8216;Brihadeeswara&#8217; in Ganasamavarali, Ganamurthi in Govinda&#8217;s mela format, has been sung with kalpanaswaras defining a praiseworthy brand of musical acumen.&#8216;Narasimha&#8217; in Mohanam, again with a spate of imaginative swara improvisations, keeps the listener fine tuned.&#8216;Gauri Velavali&#8217; is similar to Gowri Manohari, and the raga development spells maturity of thought and the capacity for pertinent presentation. Mysore V. Srikanth scripts a melodic response.&#8216;Kaumari Gauri Velavali,&#8217; extols the divine beauty of Parvati, the daughter of Himavan and the beloved of Lord Siva. The swara passages have a clear flow both in rhythm and swara sthana accuracy.The rendering of &#8216;Salwateeswaram,&#8217; in Devaganadhari in praise of the Lord residing at Salivati, is in an appropriate kalapramanan, keeping one&#8217;s attention riveted.&#8216;Kalavati&#8217; in raga Kalavati, a counterpart of Yagapriya, the 31st mela of Govinda, has its own charm though some care in the anuswarams would have enhanced the quality of the kriti interpretation.It was refreshing that the singer did not board the speed wagon right from the initial expansion of Kalyani, that seems to be the order of the day, and sported a balanced kalapramanam, chowka, madhyama and dhurita throughout the exercise.The violinist&#8217;s display is indicative of an artiste&#8217;s sensitive understanding of the essentials in raga alapana.The navavarna kriti of Dikshitar, &#8216;Kamalambam Bhajare,&#8217; is a gem and Ramprasadh does justice to the melodic and lyrical content.The &#8216;keezhkala&#8217; swaras and the faster ones are in keeping with performing demands.The tani avartanam is by Srimushnam Raja Rao (mridangam) and E.M. Subramanyam (ghatam), vidwans who have held their heads high in the fierce, competitive cauldron of percussion.Their interlude is well planned and meticulously executed. &#8216;Rangapura Vihara&#8217; in Brindavanasaranga sets the seal on a wholesome programme.
