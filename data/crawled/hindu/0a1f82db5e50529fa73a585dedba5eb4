VWith a deep voice and easy flexibility to negotiate speedy sancharas, the concert of Madhavan under the auspices of Sravanam, at the TTD Information Centre, carried the stamp of authenticity of exposition. His interpretative method served the purpose\u000a of enhancing appeal. In this process the interplay of karvais, sancharas, kirtana sangatis and alapana pattern gave direction to the items he handled. He laid heavy burden on his voice taking advantage of the fascination of his vocal mobility. He showed natural ability to transfer manodharma to telling expression.Madhavan&#8217;s recital presented musical ideas with lucidity and in the alapanas in the tara sthayi his remarkably energetic voice took strong-winged flights. One welcome aspect was that there was nothing counterfeit in his approach. With speed and madhyama kala passages there was noticeable change in pace with clever adjustment of vocal manipulation, an indication of ample talent. The alapana sancharas were laid before the rasikas with sharp precision.The overall equipment of Madhavan sprang from the guidance he has gained from three gurus recently. Though this is a plus point, there was a flip side. The different styles of the gurus, though imbibed well, were not properly integrated. In the tara sthayi, it was one thing; in kirtana rendering another and in swara sancharas still another. So there was a lack of  uniformity of style. This feature was to be discerned in the top octave sancharas of &#8216;Sri Satyanarayanam&#8217; in Subha Pantuvarali and &#8216;Om Namonarayana&#8217; in Karnaranjani,  and neraval in Sankarabharanam kirtana &#8216;Swara Raga Sudha&#8217; (Mooladaaraja).The former was overly open-throated, and in the latter the contraction of sound pattern was noticeable. If he had only paid attention to controlled introduction in the alapana without dispersing sound the impact would have been better. The reach of top octave needs decibel scrutiny to make the phrasings musical, and sahityas have to be softened to make them ear-friendly.&#8216;Thulasamma Ma Intane&#8217; (Devagandhari) breathed graciousness. Majestic, calm and controlled was the Sankarabharanam item &#8212; the bhava of the kirtana was well-preserved and experienced. He engaged himself in looking at different layers of the ragas, but essentially his process of maturity would make him realise it is rakti that matters in vinyasas. In swiftness were sung &#8216;Tanavarita&#8217; (Begada) and &#8216;Parakelanamma&#8217; (Kedaragowla). Set against his robust presentation V.V. Srinivasa Rao on the violin was a picture of moderation. There was restraint touching on essentials in the solo versions of ragas. His Sankarabharanam stood out for the truth that brevity carried more brilliance than expansion. T.M. Vaidyanathan was the mridangist. The singing pattern of Madhavan tickled his laya instincts to match punch for punch. His tani was stimulating.
