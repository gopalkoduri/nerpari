VThe global economic meltdown seems to have affected the Carnatic music scene too in the Capital. Not only has the number of music concerts gone down in the last few months, the &#8216;big ticket&#8217; artistes too are conspicuously absent. Under the circumstances this Chennai-based artiste deserve credit for providing full value to the rasika&#8217;s time and organiser&#8217;s money the other day at Delhi Tamil Sangam. N. Vijay Shiva, disciple of late D.K. Jayaraman, who sang with the two tanpuras as sruti support, enthralled the rasikas during his vocal concert of close to two-and-half an hours.It was also a concert that demonstrated how the outcome of efforts of individuals as a team is greater than the sum of individual efforts put together. Violin accompanist R.K. Shriram Kumar and mridangam accompanist N. Manoj Shiva (Vijay Shiva&#8217;s brother) had perfect understanding with the vocalist and contributed significantly in making this a memorable concert. Vijay Shiva did full justice to the Tamil composition, &#8216;Kaana kann koodi vendum&#8217; in raga Khamboji. The composition, which was the main item of his recital, was presented emotively. He presented a detailed and fine sketch of this raga. Further improvisations were in the form of niraval of the phrase &#8216;manickam vairam mudal navaratna bharanamum&#8217; and swaraprastharas rich in creativity. Shriram Kumar&#8217;s fitting take on the niraval and the swaraprastharas in his violin when it was his turn and Manoj Siva&#8217;s understanding support in his mridangam at these places added value.Earlier, Vijay Shiva presented well Tyagaraja&#8217;s fast tempo &#8216;Chinna nade na&#8217; in raga Kalanidhi. While rendering Shyama Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Meena lochana&#8217; in raga Dhanyasi, the delineation of the raga, niraval of &#8216;kama palini bhavani&#8217;, a phrase from the charanam of this composition and the subsequent swaraprastharas spoke very high of his manodharma talents. While Shriram Kumar&#8217;s delineation of the ragas, Dhanyasi and Khamboji, in his violin was excellent, Manoj Shiva&#8217;s taniavartanam (percussion solo) in Adi tal was captivating. In the post taniavartanam session, Vijay Shiva presented the entire verses of &#8216;kandar anubuthi&#8217; of Saint Arunagirinadar in seven ragas, namely Ghambira Nattai, Hindolam, Kanada, Khamboji, Sindhu bhairavi, Mandu and Madhyamavati.Maharajapuram S. Ramachandran, son and disciple of yet another maestro late Maharajapuram V. Santhanam, performed in the Capital this past week. His rendition, at the 41st anniversary celebrations of Sri Vishnu Sahasranama Satsangam, fell short of expectations. Though Ramachandran started off impressively with &#8216;Sree Mahaganapathe&#8217; in raga Nattai and Tyagaraja&#8217;s Pancharatna kriti, &#8216;Endaro mahanubhavulu&#8217; in raga Sree, he failed to sustain it. Having chosen &#8216;Madhava kesava&#8217; in raga Shanmukhapriya (a pratimadhyama raga) for a detailed presentation, he could well have avoided choosing for his main item of the recital a song composed in yet another pratimadhyama raga, Kalyani. The composition that he presented in this raga was &#8216;Pahi pahi sharade&#8217;. Instead, a song composed in a suddhamadhyama raga like Todi, Sankarabharanam, Kharaharapriya, etc. for the main item would have given a better texture. The post taniavartanam session too was a bit dragging.Nagai Muralidharan on violin, Delhi&#8217;s K.N. Padmanabhan on mridangam and K. Ramamurthi on ghatam provided able assistance.
