VMohan Santhanam&#8217;s vocal concert for R.A. Puram Bhakta Jana Sabha was a treatise by the artist on relishing of ragas and kritis for their depth and dignity. He had almost sidelined the torrents of swaras and aerobics in raga vinyasa. Not only were Mohan&#8217;s choices pleasing but also done with wisdom. Mohan demonstrated his faith in the native strength of each raga and kriti and presented them through delicate articulation without resorting to any form of overkill.Shanmukhapriya glowed in Lalgudi&#8217;s pada varnam &#8216;Devar Munivar&#8217; while &#8216;Saadinchane&#8217;, the Arabhi Pancharatna stepped up the tempo, &#8216;Isai Mazhai&#8217; in Charukesi by N.S. Chidambaram brought a softening effect. &#8216;Nenarunchi Naanu&#8217; went off like a firework, and Thodi made an elegant entry. The timing, sequencing and the selection were on agreeable lines.Mohan&#8217;s alapana in Thodi and later in Begada for Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi were definite markers of his discernment of the ragas&#8217; vital phrases; in Thodi, he might not have positioned extended phrases but included micro-fractions of brigas closely packed to build the raga image. This gave another dimension to the raga through which the range and shades of Thodi were convincingly projected. &#8216;Jesina Della&#8217; of Tyagaraja with cascading sangatis was a worthy inclusion. The lower registers in Charukesi and the calculated swara sequence, the slow development of Begada were examples of Mohan&#8217;s ability to identify and exploit the best aspects of the raga in the right proportion. Begada sancharas were significantly beguiling covering all the aspects of the melody. Here he kept the first part of the alapana on the mandra and madyama sthayee with smooth glides and sways and the second part connecting the tara sthayee attempts with finer aspects by blending akaras and longish phrasings.The pallavi which followed the brief tanam in Tisra Triputa, Khanda gati &#8216;Krishanani Dinam Dinam&#8217;  was provided with all the dispensations of the pallavi but only swaras in Begada ingeniously framed integrating the characteristic proyagas of Begada.Padma Sankar on the violin matched well with the mood of the concert and her swara sallies in Charukesi and the raga exposes in Thodi and Begada indicated her involved participation in the proceedings. Erode Nagarajan on mridangam and Nerkundram Shankar on kanjira were enthusiastic.
