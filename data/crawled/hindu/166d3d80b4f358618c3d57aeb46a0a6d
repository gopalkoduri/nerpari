VSiblings S. Archana and S. Abishek Raaja gave a scintillating dance and mridangam performance respectively at Lakshmi Sundaram Hall, Madurai.The programme began with the vocal recital of G. Madhavan who was ably supported by Abishek Raaja on the mridangam.The concert began with a brisk varnam in Sahana, followed by &#8216;Tulasi Dala&#8217; in Mayamalavagowla with niraval and kalpanaswara in the charanam in Rupaka tala (two akshara eduppu). The following kriti, &#8216;Vanchathonuna&#8217; in Karnaranjani, was rendered in Adi tala, tisra gati. Abishek rose to the challenge admirably.In the tani avartanam for the main piece, &#8216;Mamava Meenakshi&#8217; (Varali) in Misra chapu (sama eduppu), he built a variety of rhythmic patterns in different nadais.There was an interesting kuraippu Abishek exchanged with his guru Madurai.K. Thiagarajan that ended in a gripping korvai. An exercise the audience applauded heartily. A word here about G. Madhavan who kept the audience mesmerised with his music, steeped in classicism and swanubhava. His chaste delineation of the ragas and open throated singing left the audience craving for more. The violinist Sachidanandam gave admirable support.Firm footwork and exquisite expression marked Archana&#8217;s recital which began with an invocation to Ganesha followed by Natesa kavuthuvam and the sabdam Ayar Seriyar. Within the first half hour, Archana established that she had a maturity that exceeded the arangetram stage. Her prowess as a dancer emerged in full in the Abhogi varnam which the siblings dedicated to their parents.Appropriately, the pallavi was &#8216;Annaiyai Maravenadi&#8217;  a fitting tribute to her mother Mala Raja who is also her dance guru. Singers Sukanya Krishnamoorthy and Shruti with their niraval in a beautifully blended voice proved their mettle as excellent accompanists. The piece, &#8216;Om Namo Narayana,&#8217; drenched the audience in bhakti rasa while the kavadichindu, &#8216;Valli Kanavan&#8217; found Archana stealing the hearts of the audience with her abhinaya. In all, a very fulfilling evening with treat for both eyes and ears.
