VThe concert was interesting, interactive and informative. Maestro Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman displayed his mastery over the mridangam during a concert by Kunnakudi Balamuralikrishna in Thiruvananthapuram.The opening varnam &#8216;Karunimpa,' in sensuous Sahana, cast a spell on the listeners. &#8216;Sidhivinayakam' in Shanmukhapriya, sung next, was unblemished as the vocalist hit the exact notes in the three octaves. The synchronised and carved mridangam phrases inserted at regular intervals were locked in perfect laya.The beauty of it lay in the way Umayalpuram played each one uniquely, with utmost ease and clarity. The vocalist chose to sing &#8216;Narasimha mama Bhagavan' in Arabhi, set to Khanda chapu, before the intense Varali raga visthara. He showcased his calibre while singing the rich niraval and sophisticated swara frames in the kriti &#8216;Etti janma.'Elaborate raga&#8216;Paahimam shri' in Janaranjini was a brief exercise that was also sung well. Keervani, the main raga, was vividly elaborated by the vocalist while violinist Sampath also played some exquisite interludes.Umayalpuram's brilliant calculation of the tala resulted in marvellous muthaips and complicated runs that were highly aesthetic.Taniavartanam was superlative, as the veteran percussionist conjured a wide variety of innovative beat patterns. The tani was punctuated with crests and troughs of different sounds. Sundar Kumar, on the ganjira, played with a lot of passion. Although the climax was awesome, he found it difficult to keep pace with Umayalpuram. As a prelude to the ragam tanam pallavi, Umayalpuram explained the rare four-kala Khanda Jathi Thriputa tala (36 aksharam).The pallavi &#8216;Sri Rajagopalam Bhaje,' mainly in Kalyani, was also presented in Ananthabhairavi, Hamir Kalyani, and Kapi. Umayalpuram also demonstrated how to signal the &#8216;kriyas' (hand gestures) for the complex thala &#8216;Lakshmisham' (25 aksharam).A kapi raga Thilana by Poochi Srinivasaiyer, set to Lakshmisham, was immaculately sung.&#8216;Jagadhodharana' was rendered with attractive improvisations, which gave it shades of Yaman Kalyan in the coda portion. The three-and-a-half-hour concert came to a close with a buoyant thillana in Kamas.The concert was organised by Swaralaya in connection with a function to honour Umayalpuram Sivaraman.
