VT.M.Krishna&#8217;s vocal concert at the September season of music and dance festival organised by Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore, laid stress on sampradaya and his ability to explore new vistas of originality in an erudite way to highlight the essential values of Carnatic music. The opening Navaragamalika varnam, &#8216;Valachi&#8217; set the tenor for his musical agenda. The following &#8216;Janakipathe&#8217; with swaras was an aesthetic version. The steady development of rakti in the Varali alapana for the kriti, &#8216;Maragathamani&#8217; with essential karvais and sancharas was ear-worthy.&#8216;Samajavarada&#8217; in Suddhasaveri was a relaxed presentation. The elaborate niraval and swaras at &#8216;Karunatho&#8217; for the kriti, &#8216;Mari Mari Ninne&#8217; (Khambhodi) was a scholarly rendition. The other items of the fare included &#8216;Narayana Hari&#8217; (Yamunakalyani), &#8216;Samayamidhe&#8217; (Budhamanohari) and &#8216;Thanthai Thaai Irundhal&#8217; (Mukhari). Sreeramkumar (violin) was at his best in his solo versions characterised by lyrical softness in his bowing. Crisp karvais and sollu kattus enlivened the thani of Arun Prakash (mridangam) and Radhakrishnan (ghatam).Mala&#8217;s flute concert for this fest  was abounding in bhava. Warming herself with the breezy Kalyani varnam, &#8216;Vanajakshi&#8217; her deft renditions of &#8216;Tatvamariya Tharama&#8217; (Ritigowlai) and &#8216;Neelayadakshi&#8217; (Paras) drew admiration from the rasikas. Her Khambodi alapana was elaborated with &#233;lan and she was at her best in the development of its rakti for the kriti, &#8216;Sri Subramanyaya Namasthe.&#8217; Her Phalamanjari raga vinyasam had lengthy karvais with sensitive phrases for the song, &#8216;Sanathana Parama Paavana.&#8217; She carried this mood in her delineation of Kalyani, Vasantha and Bhairavi ragas in RTP, the pallavi being &#8216;Devi Paahimaam Nitya Kalyani.&#8217; Her handling of the gamakas in the raga sancharas of Kalyana Vasantham and Vasantha Bhairavi were charming. &#8216;Kuraionrumillai&#8217; song played towards the end drew wide applause. Chandramouli&#8217;s (violin) nuanced replies to the flautist&#8217;s flights of manodharma and his bowing for the thanam, alapanas and cascade of swaras were ear-friendly.  The discriminating percussive support of Manoj Siva (mridangam), Guruprasad (ghatam) and Purushothaman (ganjira) was laya intense with a rippling thani.Nithyashree&#8217;s vocal recital featured in this series, was impressive.  She made use of her vocal resources on the alapanas and the songs that she had judiciously selected. Clarity of diction and intensity of expression were evident throughout the cutcheri. Her flying start with ata taala &#8216;Chalamela&#8217; varnam in Sankarabharanam in both vilamba and durita kaalams set the tone for a lively music session. &#8216;Neethulaghu&#8217; in Mayamalavagowlai with swaras and &#8216;Bhajanaseyaradha&#8217; (Ataana) were fluid presentations. The structure of Dhanyasi built with madhyamakala passages and with akara in predominance were punctuated by sangatis and interlocked prayogas. Her Kalyani raga vinyasam was marked by softness in enunciation, brighas and delicate sangatis for the kriti, &#8216;Enthuko Nee.&#8217; The highlight of the concert in which she showcased her artistry was the RTP in &#8216;Varamupanchamukhi Nadaithe Pallavi,&#8217; chatusra triputa taalam, total 35 aksharams, 5,4,4,4,5,4,5,4. Krishnasami&#8217;s supportive role on the violin gave a fillip to the artist&#8217;s impulses and his own solo versions of the ragas and swara forays shone with his deft bowing. Arun Prakash (mridangam) and Sridhar (ghatam) garnished the compositions and swaras with apt touches of exuberance.The thematic concert of Sikkil Gurucharan on Jayamaruthi in praise of Lord Anjaneya,  was musically presentable. His judicious selection of songs after good homework received heart-warming treatment. The Kalyanavasantham varnam was a bright start followed by Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Paahirama&#8217;  with niraval and swaras. The inherent beauty of Vasantha was portrayed with effortless ease. His alapanas of Kanada and Saveri registered well. The composition, &#8216;Anjaneya Raghu Ramaduta&#8217; was a neat execution. The main raga of the kutcheri was Malayamarutham for RTP (misra triputa). Vittal Ramamurthi provided a soothing violin accompaniment. He presented Saveri and Malayamarutham with telling phrases. Prasad (mridangam) and Purushothaman (ganjira) provided valuable support in the laya wing.
