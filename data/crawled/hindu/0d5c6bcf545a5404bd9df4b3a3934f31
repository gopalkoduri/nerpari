VThe Mahadevu Radhakrishna Raju Memorial Trust and the monthlysabha,Swarajhari jointly organised thevardhanthisof Mahadevu Radhakrishna Raju and his guru Potluri Veeraraghaviah Chowdary who rendered great service to the field ofmridangamby producing scores of disciples in the traditionalgurukulasystem.After theguru poojathere was a sumptuous vocal  concert by the popular Malladi brothers, Sriram Prasad and Ravikumar. The duo was accompanied by R.K. Sriramkumar on the violin, Thiruvarur Bhakthavatsalam on themridangamand V. Suresh on theghatam. The concert, which threatened to be a noisy one initially, gradually settled down to be a soothing and melodious  one. However, the obsession of the percussionists constantly demanding more and more volume marred the effect of the concert to some extent in the initial stage.Prasad and Ravi crisply started the concert with theThodi varnamand followed it withSankari samkuruinSaveriandNanubrovamani cheppave, Ramadas's famouskeertanainKalyaniwith the elder of the two,  Prasad presenting the raga delineation pregnant with soulful phrases. For the main piece,O RangasayiinKambhojiRavikumar gave an excellent version of the raga with  richbhavaand clarity. Sriramkumar's violin support was of average quality. Bhakthavatsalam was brilliant but too loud on hismridangam. Thetanipresented by him and Suresh (ghatam) was an intricate and pleasinglaya vinyasam,which came to a close with a thundering climax.P.S.RBottom Template Starts
