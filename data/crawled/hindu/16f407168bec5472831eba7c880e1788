VCelebrating Srirama Navami, Visakha Music and Dance Academy featured a harmonium recital by retired professor of music of Banaras Hindu University, M. Veerabhadra Rao, in Kalabharathi, in Visakhapatnam.Accompanied excellently on violin by K.V.S. Prasad and mridangam by G. Venkata Rao (Principal, D.V.N. Kalakshetra), Rao started his recital with the `Atataalavarnam' in `Bhairavi' as if to prove that the instrument, if handled adroitly, could produce almost all the `gamakas' that make the exposition of Carnatic music a wholesome feast.He got himself set well playing "Vataapiganapathimbhaje" (Hamsadhwani) suffixed with elaborate `swaram' in intricate `gathi' patterns, "Nadatanumanisam" (`Chittaranjani') and "Sarasa Sama Dana" (`Kapinarayani') before he took up Mysore Vasudevachar's "Mamavathu Sri Saraswathi" (`Hindolam').Surfacing the `Raga', `Sahitya' and `laya bhavams' with heartening impact, he delighted all alike, the connoisseurs in particular. Then after  "Evarani Nirnayinchiri" (`Nagachintamani') followed by "Jnanamosagarada" (`Poorvikalyani'), he expatiated "Endukudayaradu" (`Todi') and "Chakkanirajamargamu" (`Kharaharapriya') in succession.That Veerabhadra Rao is able to surface vocal (`Gayaka Dharma') along with the `gamaka' fervour ever remains not only a laudable attribute but also an example worth emulating to keep the tradition alive . Venkata Rao's `thani' was an added attraction.A. RAMALINGA SASTRYBottom Template Starts
