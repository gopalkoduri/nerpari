VThe R.K. Bijapure Harmonium Foundation is bringing together two instrumentalists in a sort of duet or jugalbandi this Sunday, by Ravindra Katoti on the harmonium and Faiyaz Khan on the sarangi. The concert is on October 15 at Canara Union, 8th Main, Malleswaram, 6 p.m. The first part of the concert will feature Krishnendra Wadikar in a vocal concert while the second part, called "Samaras", will be a rare duet between sarangi and harmonium, often regarded as secondary instruments in a concert.Wadikar is a disciple of the late Pandit Arjunsa Nakod of Gwalior, of the Kirana Gharana. At present he is learning from Pandit Shripati Padigar, Hubli who himself is a disciple of Pandit Bhimsen Joshi of the Kirana Gharana.Ravindra Katoti started learning Hindustani classical harmonium at the age of eight. Since then he has been the disciple of Pandit Rambhau Bijapure. Ravindra's solo playing is marked by presentation in gayaki anga along with elaborate exploration of the theme in lucid alap, brilliant layakari, and clear tanakari. Achieving volume control by manipulating bellows is prominently noticeable in his rendition. He is equally proficient in rendering khayal, thumri, dhun, and natyageet.Born in a family of great musicians, Faiyaz Khan inherits music, particularly sarangi, from his forefathers, who were court musicians in the earstwhile Mysore Samsthana. His father, Ustad Abdul Khadar Khan was staff artiste on All India Radio Dharwad.Faiyaz took to tabla in his childhood. He learnt from the late Pandit Basavaraj Bendigeri. He also took lessons from Ustad Nizamddin Khan, Ustad Mammulal Sangaokarand, and the late Pandit Samta Prasad. After the demise of his father, he took to the sarangi to carry forward the family tradition. He studied under Padmabhushan Pandit Ram Narayanji for five years. He is the sole sarangi player in South India.Bottom Template Starts
