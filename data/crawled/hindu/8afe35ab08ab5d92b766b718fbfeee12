VThere was more of sound and fury than music in the first day&#8217;s vocal recital of Unnikrishnan at the music festival organised by Manoranjitham at the Sree Ayyappan Puja Sangham Hall, Coimbatore. His opening Pantuvarali varnam &#8216;Saami Nee Thodi&#8217; in slow and fast tempo after a brief alapana set the tone for the concert and he quickly followed it up with &#8216;Deva Deva&#8217; in Mayamalavagowla with a niraval and juggle of swaras.After this, every composition was preceded by an elaborate alapana, but, the audience seemed to be impatient.  The alapanas of Chandrajyoti for &#8216;Bagayanayya&#8217; and Gowrimanohari for &#8216;Garudagamana&#8217; built on brighas were in rapid strides.The Kalyani raga vinyasam was fabulous revealing his interpretative passion and control in managing the sangatis. Though his vocal movements never plummeted, clarity of diction was at a discount. At the end of it all, the rasikas could revel in the impressive and competent accompaniment of Ajit Kumar on the violin and the laya support extended by Harikumar on the mridangam.Rajhesh Vaidya&#8217;s veena recital, held at the same venue,  though masterly was lacking in finesse and poise in the presentation of compositions and ragas. Though the artist&#8217;s nimble fingers moved dexterously on the frets, the melodic beauty of music was missing in the ragas and the sukha bhava in the kritis handled.Beginning the kutcheri with a Balamuralikrishna composition in Gambhiranattai, the following &#8216;Vathapi Ganapathim&#8217; was punctuated by deep raga lakshana. But as the recital progressed, the rasika could feel that it was becoming an orchestral symphony sans emphasis on melody. The raga structure of Hamsanandi for &#8216;Paavanaguru&#8217; was built with a solid foundation of majestic prayogas. Though &#8216;Sarasasamadhana&#8217; (Kapinarayani), &#8216;Raghuvamsasudha&#8217; (Kadhana Kuthuhalam) and &#8216;Niravdhi&#8217; (Ravichandrika) were rendered in routine fashion, there was dominance of western harmony with an avalanche of ascent and descent of notes. The team&#8217;s own composition rendered in Desh raga and followed by a rhythm set up by the percussionists was a full-fledged western orchestra. The RTP in Pantuvarali the Pallavi being, &#8216;Arul Tharum Jagadguru Chandrasekhara,&#8217; accompanied by kalpanaswaras and thani was a thunderous climax. Mohankumar (mridangam), Subramanian (ghatam) and Chandrajit (tabla) were the accompanists. In sum, the recital was a thriftless m&#233;lange and the lyrical beauty of music of a classical concert was absent.
