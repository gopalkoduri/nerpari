VA. SANGAMESWARANIndian classical music has been characterised by the presence of differentbanisor gharanaas, each with its own identity that is preserved by faithful disciples. The two concerts organised by Nadopasana, Irinjalakuda, in connection with its anniversary celebrations recently, were representative of two different styles of singing in Carnatic music.Madurai T.N.S. Krishna, son of T.N. Seshagopalan, began the concert with a splendid Khamas padavarnam of Muthiah Bhagavathar, `Mathe malayadwaje,' and followed it with `Vathapi' (Hamasadwani), `Aparama' (Panthuvarali), `O Jagadamba' (Anandabhairavi) and `Gaanamoorthe' (Gaanamoorthy).The concert of V.R. Dileep Kumar on the second day was a sumptuous treat for music buffs.  The selection of ragas and kritis and its presentation  were exemplary.  The Malahari (`Panchamaathanga') that followed the pleasing Begada varnam (`Inthachalamu') set the mood of the concert.Dhenuka (`Teliyaledu Rama') and Devagandhari (`Vinarada na') had glimpses of the Semmangudi bani.  A Ghanam Krishna Iyer krithi in Rathipathipriya (`Jagadcharane') provided the impetus for the main raga Dhanyasi, which was elaborated in detail. His supple voice brought out the essence of the raga. Next, he sang `Meenalochani' of Syamasasthri and decorated it withkalpanaswarams.Bottom Template Starts
