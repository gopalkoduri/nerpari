VOothukkadu Venkatasubbier BhajansOothukkadu Muthukrishnan Devotionals (Price not indicated).The poet Oothukadu Venkatasubbaier, has carved a special niche for himself in the genre of devotional hymns. His songs have a unique, lilting quality as they are woven with beautiful lyrics, swaras and also often with `jatis.' The devotional substance, the vibrant kalapramanam and the sweet melodies place these songs in an exclusive zone. It is believed that Lord Krishna himself kept the rhythmic beats, when his bhaktha was totally immersed in the composing and singing of the compositions.Oothukkadu Muthukrishnan, who perhaps belongs to the Oothukkadu lineage, has sung 10 songs in the namasankirtanam mode, with other male and female voices in the chorus.The agenda comprises rare songs like `Jaya Radha' in Kapi, `Govinda Govinda' in Chenchurutti, `Ennamellam' in the Kolatta mettu and `Ananda Sagara' in Surutti, among others. Though the vocal presentation is modest, the album brings to light many not frequently heard songs of the great saint.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
