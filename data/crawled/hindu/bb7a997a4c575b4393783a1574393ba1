VT. K. GANAPATHYHis meettus emanating from the sonorous strings of the veena filled the entire  auditorium with melody. Rajhesh Vaidya's veena recital under the auspices of Alapana, Coimbatore, was a veritable feast to the rasikas.The vainika's kutcheri demonstrated his concern for sangita and concert technique. His presentation of kritis provided a complete image of Carnatic purity optimising professional expertise at every stage where needed.Well-aligned to sruti, Rajhesh's invocatory number, "Gajaananam" in Chakravaham was rich with bhava. After the familiar songs, "Bantureethi" (Hamsanadham) and "Thelisirama" (Poornachandrika), his Kalyanavasantham alapana developed with facile gamakas, punctuated with intense raga bhava. His own composition in Bahaar raga was full of  harmony and creativity.The delineation of Sivaranjani for another kriti   composed by him was an unimpeded flow of originality though the decibel level could have been controlled. Yet, his use of the different strings was sunaadham.His superb play of the song, Wedding Bells,  was reminiscent of the style of his guru, Chittibabu. His final number, "Chandrasekhara" was a sample of how fidelity and feeling could give a special feel when played on the veena.The tani was packed with erudite  challenges from the threesome percussion support of Mohanram (mridangam), Chandrajeeth (tabla) and Subramaniam (ghatam).Bottom Template Starts
