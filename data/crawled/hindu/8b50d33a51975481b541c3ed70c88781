Now it has taken a new dimension in the form of a telefilm in Cinemascope for the first time. Shot in locations to suit the period, the telefilm has enough entertainment and educative values for the present generation.The play is about a successful cinema actor. Fame and adulation go to his head. Circumstances force the arrogant actor to play Swami Vivekananda. He approaches a scholar to learn about the great saint. The play goes on to show how the man, inspired by Vivekananda&#8217;s life and teachings, turns over a new leaf .The telefilm &#8216;Narendra&#8217; was released in VCD format by Moser Baer under the auspices of Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha on June 21, at the Narada Gana Sabha Hall.
