VBalachandra Nakod's Hindustani concert under the auspices of Shri Ramaseva Mandali was of high order presented considering every nuance an ideal concert was supposed to embody. Veerabhadraiah Hiremath (harmonium) and Raghavendra Nakod (tabla) accompanied the singer.Contrary to the usual notion that a khyal exposes the personality of the raga than the imports of its lyrical contents, this singer of remarkable imagination and refinement, melodically enlivened every word creating a unique musical atmosphere.An aesthetic build is in fact a paradigm of musical decorum, wherein the form of the raga, its essence, the subject matter of the lyrics, and the manner of blending different elements of the particular genre under interpretation, constitutes one musical whole. Nakod's first khyal &#8220;Karima Nama&#8221; in Miya Malhar served as a comprehensive illustration of such an ideology.Meends of different amplitudes, likewise the andolans and gamaks, combined with his resilient javaridar (rich in overtones) voice capable or traversing the desired octaves, beautified the composition.He would not hastily arrive at redundant sam-s or tihayi-s until he is intuitively assured of a thorough exploration of the moods, different melodic passages he would build up, are able to yield. With every linear increase in the tempo, the emotional fervour would rise to sentimental ecstasies reaching pleasant and welcome emphatic climaxes (of course, at times dramatic), followed by the accompanists with astounding sagacity and perseverance. There was not a moment of laxity on the part of the melody accompanist, Veerabhadraiah Hiremath, whatever may be the moment of intricacy the singer was materialising to suit his extempore. In addition, he would lend his own imagination liberally and judiciously to complement those of the lead artiste.On such a fertile ground, lyrical sections of the khyaal &#8220;Ve Athi Dhoom Dhoom Ath Aave Badariya&#8221;, replete with expressions and embellishments flourished leading to and merging with another of Sadarang, &#8220;Bolere Papee Hara&#8221;. In these passages, observe how the skilled and imaginative percussionist framed the rhythm-passages to suit the lyrical import and the singer's lyric-oriented vocalisations.When Nakod sang &#8220;Pagava Brij Dekhneko Chalori&#8221; in Basant, the experience found its completion and the numbers that followed, &#8220;Rama Rama&#8221; (Parameshwari-Purandaradasa), &#8220;Jambudweepa&#8221; (vachana of Basavanna) and &#8220;Bolna&#8221; (Bhairavi) crowned that experience.
