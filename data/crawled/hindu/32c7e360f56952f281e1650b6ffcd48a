VV.R. Dileep Kumar is blessed with the ability to express the ragabhava of lyrics. In a concert at Vaidyanadhaswami Temple, Palakkad, Dileep's chaste alapana of Sahana, Gourimanohari and Varali brought out the rakthi of the ragas beautifully. The vocalist's strict adherence to sruthi and laya also helped make the concert a memorable one. R. Swaminadhan on the violin, Cherthala Dinesan on the mridangam and Kovai Suresh on the ghatam complemented the artiste beautifully.The concert began with a majestic and rhythmic Nattakkurinchi Ata tala varnam of Subramanyayyar, &#8216;Samininne.' Tyagaraja's &#8216;Guruleka iduvandi guniki,' set to Khadhachappu tala, was followed by a Tamil composition of Papanasam Sivan on Lord Siva, &#8216;Padamethunai Paramasiva' in Valachi.Tyagaraja's philosophical composition &#8216;Ee Vasudha Neevandi Daivamu' had a soulful bhava-laden exposition of Sahana. Muthayya Bhagavathar's &#8216;Sarasamukhi sakalabhagyathe' in Goudamallar was followed by Varali, which was embellished with subtle gamakas that brought out the various facets of this raga.Dileep's ability to render slow-paced renditions was evident in his pristine rendition of a Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Seshachananadham bhajami,' which was set to Roopaka tala. An improvisation at the lyrical sequence &#8216;Aravindapathra nayanam&#8230;' was marked with deft diction. It was garnished with a cascading swarakalpana.Graceful elaborationA fast paced &#8216;Kanjadalayadakshi' in Kamalamanohari was followed by the highlight of the evening, a graceful execution of the pentatonic raga Madhyamavathy.Tyagaraja's &#8216;Ramakadhasudha' in Choukkakala kriti had an embellished niraval and swara strings of arithmetic acumen at &#8216;Bhamamani Janaki&#8230;' that showcased his mastery.A lively tani was followed by devotionals. The concert was organised in connection with the Mahakumbhabhishekam of Vaidyanadhaswami Temple.
