VThe annual Kalpathy music festival in Palakkad began with Mangala Vadhyam (nagaswaram) by Raghunath. Each day of the six-day fete was dedicated to great musicians.The inaugural concert by the Hyderabad sisters, Lalitha and Haripriya, created the ideal concert mood with &#8216;Jalajaksha,' the opening Hamsadhwani varnam of Manambuchavadi Venkatasubbiah, followed by &#8216;Sri Jalandharamasrayamyaham' in Gambhiranatta, a kriti of Mysore Maharaja, and Dikshitar's &#8216;Annapurne visalakshi' in Saama. Initially, the sisters had some trouble with their voices. However, they warmed up soon enough and came up with a moving rendition of &#8216;Teliyaleru Rama,' a Tyagaraja kriti in raga Thenuka.The duo chose Keeravani as the main raga of the evening. Haripriya's comprehensive exposition of the raga was excellent. The raga swaroopa was further embellished by a classical thaanam, rendered by both. The kriti was Tyagaraja's &#8216;Kalikiyunte gadha.'Accompanists Trivandrum Sampath (violin), Palakkad Jayakrishnan (mridangam), Manjoor Unnikrishnan (ghatam) and Nerkunam Sankar (ganjira) excelled. The second day, which was dedicated to Dikshitar, featured Trichy Ganesan. His keen analytic intellect was evident throughout the recital. He made an impressive start with a spirited rendering of &#8216;Viribhoni,' Pachimiriyam Aadhiyappayya's Bhairavi varnam in Ada tala. His rendition of Dikshitar's &#8216;Vaatapi Ganapathim' in Hamsadwani saw Ganesan exploring new vistas in swaraprastharas.Rare ragasGanesan has a liking for rare ragas. His in-depth analysis of the ragas, &#8216;Kokilapriya,' the 11th mela and &#8216;Rishabhapriya,' the 62nd mela, clearly brought out their distinct features. The kritis chosen were Dikshitar's &#8216;Kothandaramam anisam bhajaami' and Koteeswara Iyer's &#8216;Gananaya desika gaana rasika.'While Ganesan's deep erudition and manodharma are undisputable, his over indulgence in kalpana swaras, bordered on monotony at times, which rather marred the beauty of an otherwise pleasing recital. Violinist C.S. Anurup, Kodunthirappully Parameswaran (mridangam), Kottayam Unnikrishnan (ghatam) and Thiruppur Sridhar Kumar (ganjira) came good in the concert.Abishek Raghuram, grandson of the late mridangam maestro Palghat Raghu, sang on the third day, which was dedicated to Syama Sastri. Judicious selection, strict adherence to sruti and a clear diction made his concert a memorable one.&#8216;Chalamela jesevura,' the Sankarabharanam varnam of Swati Tirunal in Ada tala, followed by Syama Sastri's &#8216;Neelaayadakshi neeve' in raga Paras and Tygaraja's &#8216;Enthunti vetalithivo' in Darbar, imparted a majestic beginning to the evening's proceedings.Wide repertoireAs a proof of his wide repertoire, he rendered &#8216;Sathaleni,' a kriti of Tyagaraja in the rare raga &#8216;Naaganandhini,' before taking up Madhyamavathi for an in-depth elaboration and his manodharma knew no bounds as he started his exploration. It had subtle &#8216;brigas' and graceful &#8216;gamakas.' Syama Sastri's &#8216;Paalimsu kaamakshi' was an apt choice.Violinist Akkarai Subbalakshmi followed the vocalist with perfection. Anand, another grandson of Palghat Raghu, provided excellent support on the mridangam. Udipi Srikanth (ganjira) also impressed.The fourth day, earmarked for the royal composer Swati Tirunal, featured Vijayalakshmi Subramanian. Opening with the Kanada raga varnam &#8216;Nera Nammithinayya' of Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar, she proceeded to render &#8216;Gajaananayutham,' a Diksitar kriti in Chakravaaham and &#8216;Nee paadhame gathi,' a GNB composition in Nalinakanthi.She took up Thodi thereafter and gave only a brief sketch of the raga. It was rather surprising that she chose this major raga in the early stage of the concert and failed to do full justice to the delineation. Even the neraval in the Tyagaraja krithi &#8216;Aemi Chesithemi' was brief. The kalpana swaras, especially those centered around the &#8216;panchamam,' were pleasing.Vijayalakshmi's elaboration of Simmendramadhyamam, the main raga of the concert, was noted for its graceful gamaka oscillations. Swati's immortal piece &#8216;Rama Rama guna seema' was an ideal selection but the neraval did not find a place in her depiction of the kriti. Her improvisations in the swaraprastharas were impressive.Trivandrum S.R. Rajasree (violin), Kallekulagara Unnikrishnan (mridangam), C.S. Venkataramanan (ganjira) and Mysore Gururaj (morsing) were her accompanists.Mysore M. Nagaraj and M. Manjunath excelled in their violin duet on the fifth day, which celebrated Purandaradasa.Instant rapportThe brothers established an instant rapport with the listeners, right from the opening pieces, which were Purandaradasa's &#8216;Gajavadana beduve' in Natta and Dikshitar's &#8216;Annapurne visalakshi' in Saama. Manjunath's detailed elaboration of Sri Ranjani was superb. The kriti was &#8216;Kodubega divyamathi' of Purandaradasa.Swati Tirunal's &#8216;Maamava sada janani' in Kanada and Tyagaraja's &#8216;Entha muddho entha sogaso' in Bindumaalini &#8211; a hot favourite among contemporary musicians &#8211; were played gracefully. Nagaraj's stage by stage development of the main raga Kalyani, adorned by classical gamakas, showcased the multifaceted hues of this majestic raga. Subtle improvisations in the neraval in the Purandaradasa kriti &#8216;Nambikkettavarill' and the imaginative manipulations in the swara patterns revealed the duo's skilful techniques in fingering and bowing and their command over the instrument.Kovai Prakash (mridangam), Perukav P. L. Sudheer (ghatam) and Payyanur Govinda Prasad (morsing) revelled in their roles.On the concluding day, set aside for Annamacharya, the Carnatica brothers, Sasikiran and Ganesh, gave a pleasing vocal recital.After beginning the concert with Swati Tirunal's Ada tala varnam &#8216;Sarasijanabha ninnu' in Kambodhi, the brothers rendered &#8216;Sriman narayana,' an Annamacharya composition in Bowli and the Swati kriti in Reethigowla, &#8216;Paripaalayamam,' in quick succession.Sasikiran's aalapana of Amritavarshini was commendable. Dandapani Desigar's &#8216;Ennai nee maravadhe,' not often heard on the concert platform, was a welcome choice.Moving portrayalAfter a moving portrayal of &#8216;Maayamma,' a Syama Sastri kriti in Aahiri, the duo took up the not-so-popular raga &#8216;Sumanesaranjani' for extensive treatment. The fact that both the brothers could delineate this rare raga with ease, bore testimony to their prowess.After the taniavartanam, the brothers rendered the Sampradaya bhajan song &#8216;Narayanathe namo namo' in Behag. They concluded the concert with Purandaradasa's mangalam.Kovai Balasubramanian's essay of &#8216;Sumanesaranjani' on the violin was brilliant. Kuzhalmannam Ramakrishnan (mridangam), Trichy Murali (ghatam) and A.S.Krishnan(moorsing) displayed their skills in abundant measure.In the junior slot, Punnayurkulam V. Ramesan, N.J. Nandini, K.Muralidharan Unni, and M.R. Prasobh also gave pleasing vocal recitals.The festival was organised by The District Tourism Promotion Council, Palakkad.
