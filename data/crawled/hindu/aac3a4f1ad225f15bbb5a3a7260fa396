VKasturi Rangan's forceful and deep voice with waves of rolling akara conferred classical weight on his exposition in Sri Thyagaraja Seva Samiti's Bahula Panchami concert. Raga alapanas provided solid experience occasionally with excess vocalisation. Sancharas, deeply reflective, focussed on highlighting the radiance of the ragas, Sankarabharanam and earlier Pantuvarali.He freely let his voice unfold his manodharma and formulated its progress in vidwat idiom. With spells of inspiration, his talent combined smoothness of music's flow with the chaste characteristics of classicism. This lofty approach and relevant technique indicated the lines of his grooming.Melodic majesty was his prized performing base. This could be sensed in the many variations in negotiating the tara sthayi segment. This to a great extent explained the pulsating pleasantness.Impressive and creativeSankarabharanam (&#8216;Yaduta Nilachite') provided the core of the recital. Kasturi Rangan's creativity couched in elegant twists and turns counted for its impressiveness. Vocal immensity exerted its influence on providing Sankarabharanam's panoramic edifice. A major part of development explored many levels of the raga's reach. The phrasings documented the moorchana boundaries and the akara-packed raga complex was gradually presented.The interpretative method well communicated the loveliness of the kirtana. The flow of the sangatis was set against the grandeur of the piece. It hit the right aesthetic areas, a method imbibed from his guru Seshagopalan's style. It would do him much good to convert imitation to emulation and observe restraint for artistic effect. The first taste of the concert at the start, the Aarabhi Pancharatnam &#8216;Saadinchane' whetted the appetite for the rest of the songs &#8212; &#8216;Sangita Gnanamu' (Dhanyasi), &#8216;Evarikai' (Devamanohari) and &#8216;Dunmarga' (Ranjani). The rendering of the kirtanas in general drew strength from exuberance packed in them.While overall the singing represented Carnatic flavour, Kasturi Rangan's Pantuvarali alapana was in the ustad mode. The kirtana was &#8216;Appa Rama Bhakti.' It was not a single factor that ensured the brilliance of the programme. Voice, talent, guru's influence and steadfastness combined to project Carnatic solidarity.As against the thrustful approach of the vocalist, V.V. Srinivasa Rao, on the violin, softly textured the ragas Sankarabharanam and Pantuvarali in his solo sessions. His play incorporated gentle touches to the sancharas and the economy in building Sankarabharanam was noteworthy, stressing the essence concerted more than elaboration. It was a very respectable face of Sankarabharanam that he delineated.Mannarkoil Balaji's mridangam revealed a style of play wedded to laya substance. There was, good balance between expertise and efficiency, in his thani.
