VAnjana RajanHis eyes twinkle with good humour and his one-liners bring the house down. Be it at a rehearsal, on a journey, or backstage, R.S. Krishnan is the life of the party. The septuagenarian violinist, who hails from Tiruvarur in Tamil Nadu, is a disciple of Rajamanikkam Pillai and Thiruvarur Sethuraman."Lots of people claim to have learnt from Rajamakikkam Pillai, but in Delhi I am the only one," says Krishnan with zest. "Everyone in my family is involved with music for the last three generations.  I came to Delhi in 1971 to teach music under the Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha. Then I joined the University of Delhi as an instrumentalist till I retired in 1996."Making recordsAll these years Krishnan has been an accompanist to eminent vocalists and instrumentalists of the Carnatic tradition, besides Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi and Mohiniattam dancers. He also teaches the violin. So many in fact, that he cheerfully talks of the possibility of being included in the Guinness' Book of World Records for the largest number of students. Though verification has yet to be completed, there are other pointers to his undimmed enthusiasm for life with its ups and downs."At present I have about 60 students. Around 20 come to my house. I take lessons in other areas too. Everywhere I go on my trusty scooter. But when my students can't attend class, I give them lessons over the phone!"As for playing, he says, "In music, I prefer to play for vocal. In dance, I prefer Bharatanatyam, because the purity of Carnatic music is to be found in it. You don't find dilution of ragas."Krishnan affectionately recalls special programmes, such as when he composed songs on Mahatma Gandhi's martyrdom day and presented them before R. Venkataraman, then Vice President of India. There was also the National Programme of Music presented by Doordarshan back in 1988. "It was a magnificent programme. It was an orchestra of 50. They were all my violin students along with a few percussionists. I also played with them. It was one of the best experiences of my life."Age and experience don't stop Krishnan from accompanying youngsters. "I have played for Yamini Krishnamurti, Sonal Mansingh, Swapnasundari, Radha and Raja Reddy, Deepti Omcherry and others, right down to the young artistes," he says. As if in proof, there is a Bharatanatyam arangetram he plays for this week. Coming up too is a concert in honour of Devi at the inauguration of the Kamakshi temple in Gurgaon on October 12.Bottom Template Starts
