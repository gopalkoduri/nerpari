VHamsadhwani organised a Harikatha on &#8220;Meenakshi Kalyanam&#8221; by B. Suchithra on September 19, as a tribute to M.S. Subbulakshmi, whose 92nd birth anniversary was on September 16. Suchithra, who had her early music training under T.N. Seshago\u000apalan, now trains under Padma Sandilyan. She learnt the art of Harikatha from her grandmother Thanjavur Kamala Murthy, a disciple of Annasamy Bhagavatar.Suchithra began the Harikatha with a song &#8220;Bhajamanuja&#8221; in Purvikalyani. Suchithra had this explanation for why most of the names of God are in two syllables, like Rama, Hari, Siva and so on. They are easy to chant. Also they will not be shrunk and mutilated.She then explained the benevolence of God. It was here that  Suchithra tended to be repetitive.  She could have used stories to avoid this. Back to the hero of the story &#8211; Siva. Unlike His brother-in-law Narayana, who is always nattily dressed, Siva has only snakes for adornment. Could Siva have anticipated the increase in the price of gold, and therefore decided to settle for snakes instead, Suchithra wondered.But Siva becomes rich when He marries Meenakshi. What does Meenakshi bring him? The answer is in a Peria Puranam verse &#8212; &#8220;Sezhiyarpiraan Tirumagalai.&#8221; Meenakshi is described as &#8220;thozhu kanavanukku than magudam sootti... arasu alitha pennarasi.&#8221; She made her husband the ruler of Madurai.But how did Meenakshi  become the Queen of Madurai? King Malayadwaja Pandian and his wife Kanchanamalai have no children. Isn&#8217;t it a grievance that usually sets history in motion, Suchithra asked. Except that in this case, the turn of events is propitious. As the king laments that a life without children is like music without sruti, a three-year old girl comes out of the sacrificial fire and addresses Kanchanamalai as &#8216;amma.&#8217;The child is named Meenakshi, and is taught all the 64 arts, and at the appropriate time, crowned Queen of Madurai. But Kanchanamalai cries&#8217; &#8220;Yaadu seiguvaen, maadu nin yauvanam kandu&#8221; (Atana).&#8221;Meenakshi is of marriageable age, but has found no suitor. So Meenakshi decides to go in search of the groom  and  reaches Kailasam, the abode of Siva, and realises that her quest has ended.Meenakshi&#8217;s wedding takes place in Madurai. There is an interesting story about how River Vaigai got its name. Siva summons the Ganges to quench the thirst of a bhootaganam, who drinks the water with cupped hands. What is left after he has had his fill, flows around Madurai as the river Vaigai. Since he touched the water with his hands, it became Vaigai.Almost all our wedding rituals are patterned after Meenakshi Kalayanam, said Suchithra, as is seen in the oonjal song, where we sing &#8216;Kanchanamalai Manamagizhndal,&#8217; a reference to Meenakshi&#8217;s mother. Suchithra could have elaborated on what other rituals owe their inspiration to Meenakshi Kalyanam. Maybe next time, she could cut short the introductory part, and focus on the topic chosen.Suchithra struck a neat balance between narrative and song, without one overwhelming the other. Her singing showed her excellent grounding in music. Suchithra&#8217;s rendering of Bhooparipaalanam seidaal (Paras), Bhuvaniyil (Mukhari), Kuvalayatilaka (Maandu), and Maindarilla vaazhvum (Ananda Bhairavi) was particularly good. Villivakkam Raghuraman on the violin and Tillaisthanam Suryanarayanan on the mridangam lent her support.As a tribute to M.S., Suchithra sang &#8220;Kaatrinile&#8221; and &#8220;Kurai ondrum illai,&#8221; at the conclusion of the Harikatha.
