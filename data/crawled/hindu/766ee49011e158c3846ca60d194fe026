VN.Ramamurty, a disciple of Late B.R.C. Iyengar, a noted musicologist was in Hyderabad last week and presented a concert under the Nada Bharathi banner. He is a Chartered Accountant and has been in Zambia for the last five years and was on a short visit to India.He has a rich voice and also adequate manodharma which is his strength. He excels in raga rendition and his keerthana pathantaram reflects good sangathis.He began with a tough ragam Nayaki and sang a varnam in Khanda triputa which is a rare piece. Mundu Venukala iruprakkala today a classical item in Darbaru was rendered with good sangathis of the ragam in tact.The main attraction of the day was the mighty ragam Khambhoji. Any concert containing Ghana ragams like Thodi, Bhairavi and Khambhoji and if they are sung in right proportion will be a real treat to the rasikas. Ramamurty did very well in bringing the flair of the ragam and sung the noted Thyagaraja's composition O Ranga Sayee in a relaxed manner.Neraval at Bhuloka Vaikunta shows the sound knowledge of the artiste with catchy swaram in it. This was followed by Guruvai Panindhu a Tamil composition in Ranjani, and finally with a Sai Bhajan in Sama and concluded with Badalika theera in Reethigowla. Komanduri Rajan on the violin gave an improvised performance and did neat accompaniment.
