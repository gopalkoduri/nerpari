VSpencer Plaza &#8212; a narrow passage in a shop flanked by rows of cases stacked with CDs is converted into a makeshift room. The awesome sight of huge golden harp standing on a red platform at the far end of the passage cheers me. The chattering of Sunday shoppers milling around&#8230; curious onlookers pausing to look at the harp&#8230; the loud, insistent demand of a child&#8230; my heart sinks &#8212; hardly an ambience for a concert. But the proceedings of the next hour hallow that little corner at Landmark on the evening of November 23.Gwyneth Wentink, tall &#8212; taller than her six-foot harp &#8212; walks towards me with a cheery grin, hand outstretched. A half-hour telephonic interview graciously given the previous day leads now to a warm handshake.She talks to the disappointingly small audience for a few minutes, explaining how the harp works; asks for questions, answers them.She then dips her hands in a bowl of water, dries them, sits on a small stool, pulls the harp over to her shoulder and starts waving her magic wand with her hands &#8211; and feet!Wentink&#8217;s youthful exuberance was reflected in the brilliantly played lively allegro from the Sonata in three movements by the Czech composer J. L Dussek (1760-1812), that she chose to start with. It sounded very much like a piano but with a different timbre.The slower andantino was executed with caressing movements of her hands. The rondo with the recurring theme was beautifully and at times tenderly played.Wentink confessed that she fell in love with the piece at a concert. The English composer J. Thomas (1626-1913) had titled her next piece, &#8216;The Minstrel&#8217;s Adieu to his Native Land.&#8217;A sombre theme; played slowly in the lower registers, with great empathy evoked nostalgia and sadness.The sonorous tone of the sustained notes spoke for the choice of the kind of wood used in the soundboard, usually pine or mahogany.Carlos Salzedo (1886-1961) was an American harpist; his six &#8220;Variations on a Theme in the Ancient Style&#8221; exemplified the different characteristics of harp music. The glissandos were tantalisingly smooth; the evenly executed trills using both hands showed Wentink&#8217;s phenomenal technique. Each variation did indeed give a glimpse of what a master player on the harp could get out of the instrument. Wentink said she played it first when she was six &#8212; more of this later.The next piece was also a Salzedo, &#8216;Chanson Dance la Nuit.&#8217; It sounded more modern at times. Wentink&#8217;s superb command of the instrument brought out vastly different timbres from the harp, including the percussive tones she produced directly on the soundboard. Next she played her favourite pieces from the English composer. William Croft (1678-1727) titled &#8216;Saraband and Ground&#8217; delightfully exquisite playing. She signed off her performance with a flourish playing in a much lighter mood and with sharp crisp bursts, &#8220;Carneval de Venise&#8221; by the Belgian composer F. Godefroid  (1818-1897; a prolific composer, his method for the harp is still in use).If Wentink&#8217;s musicality is astounding (she barely glanced at the score &#8212; and she has a huge repertoire of just concertos alone), her perfect coordination of hands and feet is amazing; if the dexterity of her fingers is unbelievable, her control of the muscles of her hands and fingers dictated by the demands of a vast range of dynamics, is unimaginable. And that Wentink, now 27, was gifted with all this while in her teens is nothing short of a miracle. She left us spellbound.The most notable feature of the harp is that the soundboard is perpendicular to the plane of the strings, unlike the piano, violin and guitar, where it is parallel. A highly complicated system involving about 2,000 handcrafted and machine &#8211;tooled parts in the curved neck and vertical column changes the pitch of a string when one of the seven pedals is pressed.The harp demands precise, complex coordination of hands and feet. The instrument used at the concert was flown from Italy by its makers, Salvi, who are currently sponsoring Wentink. The 47 strings made of gut (sheep), metal and nylon span six and a half octaves.How the prodigy blossomedSo, how did Wentink come to play Salzedo when she was just six? Thereby hangs an incredible tale. When she was barely four years old, Gwyneth Wentink saw the harp at concerts she had gone to with her pianist-mother and conductor-father and decided the harp would be her instrument for life. Starting with private lessons on a Celtic harp (smaller, simpler version of the regular harp) at home, she gave her first concert at six, and at eight she with the Netherlands National Youth Orchestra in Rotterdam. At 10 she performed for the Dutch Queen Beatrix.From age eleven she has been capturing the first prize at competitions all over the world, in particular, the prestigious International Nippon Harp Competition at Tokyo. When she won the first prize at the Young Concert Artists International Auditions in New York at17, she became the first solo harpist ever, to be awarded the distinction in its 40-year history.Again, when she won the prestigious International Harp Competition in Israel at 17, she became the youngest contestant ever, to win the prize. Wentink has visited India as a tourist several times but this is the first time she has performed as a harpist; she gave concerts at Bangalore and Pune before her first concert in Chennai at the Fisherman&#8217;s cove on November 22. She will have performed in Hyderabad and Delhi before the end of this month.An ardent admirer of the Indian flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia, she learnt to play Indian music on the harp. She hopes to come here again. Chennai salutes and thanks the harp prodigy and a lovely human being in Gwyneth Wentink.
