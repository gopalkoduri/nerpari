VNeelothpala nayikeSa re ga maClassical CarnaticM. Balamurali KrishnaCD (Price Rs.145)M. Balamurali Krishna is a `never say die' vidwan whose concentrated unswerving commitment to music emphasises the dictum that age is just a mere number. "Neelothpala Nayike" of Muthuswami Dikshitar in Reetigowla is sung with the artiste's customary clarity of diction that facilitates percentage appreciation of the beauty of the lyrical substance.The exposition of Kalyani in various Kalapramanams covering an amazing expanse in the different octaves, showcases a thinking mind with depth and originality. Annavarapu Ramaswami, a senior violinist, replies in suitable fashion. Syama Sastri's "Birana Varalichi," with the singer's captivating vocal timbre at its best, is a melodic, graphic interpretation.Imaginative processIt is unusual for the raga Amritavahini to be delineated in detail. Only a venturesome, imaginative mental process would activate the effort and create an absorbing impact.Amritavahini is the derivative of the 20th Mela Natabhairavi, and not many composers have attempted songs in this scale. Perhaps `Sri Rama Padhama,' the only kriti of Tyagaraja in this melody is the best-known composition. Tyagaraja's choice of this raga is most appropriate to suit the emotional content in the kriti.The swara passages in both Kalyani and Amritavahini have innovative swara poruthams in the final solfa sequences. Amritavahini appears as Amritavarshini in the programme details. The tani avartanam by Guruvayoor Durai on the mridangam and T.H. Subaschandran on the Ghatam, albeit brief, is sensitively etched with laya variations with a stately deportment.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
