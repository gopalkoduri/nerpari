VA. RAMALINGA SASTRYSagara Mekhala, a noted literary and cultural association founded and managed by  women, organised a show ofashtaavadhaanam(accomplishing eight literary feats at the same time) by renowned Mahasahasravadhani Dr. Garikipati Narasimha Rao of Kakinada in Kalabharathi last week. The function got off to an auspicious start with the benedictory address of the chief guest of the evening, Saduguru Sriman K. Sivananda Murthy of Bhimili Anandasramam. Theavadhanamcomprised the simultaneous fulfilment of eight jobs likesamasyapooranam(supplementing the lines haphazardly given by thepruchhakato get them into the form of a poem of meaningful substance conforming to the rules of prosody),nishiddhakshari(composing a similar poem avoiding the letters specified phrase after phrase),dattapadhi(weaving a similar poem with the given four words),aasuvu(similar poetic exercise that has to be impressionistic),puranapathanam(explaining the given poem with its reference and context),varnana(poetic description of a given theme),vyasthakshari(listing out the randomly given letters in proper order to get them into a statement) andaprastutha prasangam(instant retort to some impertinent talk interposed in between).An exercise that fairly fulfilled all the technical requirements with gay abandon, it turned out to be a rich entertainer to the common audience all right. Sans the expected aesthetically artistic finish and finesse for which Garikipati is well known, it proved to be an exercise that disappointed many a learned including the critique among the audience.Bottom Template Starts
