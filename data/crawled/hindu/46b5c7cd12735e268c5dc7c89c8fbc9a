VPrabha Atre&#8217;s Hindustani vocal recital was a class apart &#8212;  a treasury of many salient nuances of the art form, where the singing created an arousal of innate, tender and sublime sentiments lying dormant in the deep recesses of the intell\u000aect.One of the distinguishing features was her ideal stage presence as envisaged in the scriptures &#8212; an embodiment of dignity and exceptional poise. She instils into her presentations a majesty and grandeur, transporting the audience to a state of ineffable musical silence.Her well-groomed mature voice has carefully preserved its bewitching vibrancy and disarming gentle timbre; the style being shaped on sound discretion and aesthetics. It reveals a tone of authority and assertion.Even in the midst of spontaneity, an undercurrent of definite method and scholarship made their presence clearly felt. A fine blend of riyaz and sadhana has evolved itself, in her, into a consummated artistry.Consider the bandish, &#8220;Mangala Nama Shri Ganesh&#8221; (Shyam Kalyan) which commenced with a truly slow cadence; this barabar-ki-lay in fact ensured a majestic progression to the whole khayal in addition to imparting clarity to all its vital components. A priority for diction, expressions and mood cleared the barrier of language, paving the way for a hearty appreciation. Meends, kans and other rag-alankars were delicately employed imparting lalithya to the bandhish.Badhat went on incessantly in progressive increments passing through different levels of the required sthayis.Cyclical reversions to the mukhdas (first few words of the composition) to end in harmonic closes were not just treated as mere formal sams; she would invariably charge them with that captivating mood which is enshrined in the related swara phrases and lyrics.After having completed the exposition of the raga satisfactorily, the process of exploring other dynamics of music commenced: sargams were no exception to her creativity. Improvisations were carried on with additions of gamaks and kans. She would thus finely merge the intrinsic lilt of rhythm with the melodic lull she creates.Taans ranging from gentle to heavy arpeggios were now introduced. Vidyuth taans made their appearance in the druth-tarana with a difference &#8212; their amplitude, depth, speed and impact, created a world of wizardry, yet in tune with the basic mood of tranquility.Her rendition of &#8220;Tann Mann Dhan&#8221; in Kalavathi retained all the merits enunciated above, reinforced by an array of sargams, taans, taranas and so on.After &#8220;Ban Ban Doond&#8221; in Bageshri and a light classical tune &#8220;Jamuna Kinare&#8221;, the learned veteran sang the path of realisation. The forlorn being, having wasted precious life in mundane muddles under the spell of delusion and ignorance, realises and repents in &#8220;Mori Meine Khogoyare&#8221; (Bhairavi).The accompanists were Chetana Banavat (supporting voice) Rajendra Nakod (tabala) and Veerabhadrayya Hiremath (harmonium).Vasundhara Performing Arts Centre, Ragamilan and Swaramayee (Mumbai) jointly organised the concert marking the 75th birthday of Prabha Atre.V.
