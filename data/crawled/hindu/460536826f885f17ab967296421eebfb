VHARISH BALKalikotta Palace, Thripunithura, was the venue for Maruti Sangeetolsavam, the 32nd anniversary celebrations of Poornathrayeesa Sangeeta sabha. The first day drew huge crowds who flocked to listen to a  violin duet featuring Balabhaskar and his guru and uncle, B. Sasikumar.Vocal concertThe second day featured a Carnatic vocal concert by Rudrapatanam brothers R.N. Thyagarajan and R.N. Tharanathan. `Chalamela,' a varnam in Nattakurinji, and `Jaya jaya Ramakanta' in Nattai were the commencing pieces. Thyagarajan's expansion of Yadukula kamboji was marked with modulations and vigour.`Divakarathanujam,' one of the navagraha kritis of Dikshithar, was delectable owning to the purity of the patanthara.  Thyagarajan's Kharaharapriya rendition had a structured progression and compactness. Muttara Raveendran's violin  gave it that added touch of finesse.`Chakkaniraja'  shone with its remarkable niraval, which retained the sahitya bhava despite travelling through myriad phrases.  A detailed complex mukthaippu gave that additional rhythmic fervour.Thiruvizha Jayasankar's nadaswaram concert on the final day began with  `Jalandhara' in the melodious Valaji raga.In a short sketch of Kedaragowla, Jayasankar was able to bring out the character of the raga. Jayasankar's raga essays never follow a step-by-step approach and are rather wholesome. This was evident in Sudhasaveri and Kamboji ragas that followed. `Manavyalakim' in Nalinakanti was attractive with its connecting swara phrases in between the lines of the pallavi.`Samodam chintayami,' composed by Swati Tirunal, displayed Jayasankar's dexterity in the mathematics of swaras as he wove compact phrases and korvais precisely into the rhythmic framework. Prior to the concert,  actor Balachandra Menon felicitated Thiruvizha Jayasankar and Sankara Namboothiri with the `Sangeeta Sampoorna' and `Yuva Sangeeta Prathibha' titles respectively.Bottom Template Starts
