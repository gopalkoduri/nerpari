VApart from music recitals, a play was also staged at the 38th  anniversary celebrations of Pollachi Tamizhisai Sangham, held at Mahatma Gandhi Mandapam, Pollachi.Chennai Goodwill Stage presented , &#8216;Thaayum aanavan&#8217;, a play in which Gemini Mahalingam, Gajendra Kumar, Anandhi, Balaji, Maheshwari, Kovai Padhu and Srinivasan took part. And the    members of the audience could relate to the realistic and emotional scenes.Later, flute legend N. Ramani shared the stage with his son and disciple, Thiyagarajan. Thiyagarajan is a well-known flautist in his own right.&#8216;Age cannot wither her,  nor custom stale her infinite variety&#8217;, said Shakespeare about Cleopatra. One is obliged to borrow his lines to describe the performance of N. Ramani. Imagination poured out like a cascade and the fingers were  equally quick to translate them into music.The duo began with Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s varnam in Valaji. &#8216;Entharo Mahanubhavulu&#8217; by Tyagaraja followed the offering of respect to all the great people.Strangely, Bahudari featured in all the three concerts. Earlier, Vasundhara had sung  Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Brova baaramaa&#8217;, while the violin and flute concerts had included &#8216;Sadhaanandha thaandavam&#8217; by Achyutha Dasar.The delineation of Karaharapriya was like laying the &#8216;raaja maargam&#8217; (the highway) through which the kriti &#8216;Chakkani raja maargamu&#8217; travelled majestically. The tail-end comprised the usual favourites, &#8216;Nagumomu&#8217;, &#8216;Ninnu vinaa naamadhendhu&#8217;, &#8216;Kaliyuga varadhan&#8217; and &#8216;Theeraadha vilayaattuppillai&#8217;.Thiruvalluvar had claimed that the flute and the veena were  the most melodious instruments. Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi, who accompanied them on the violin that day, strongly advocated the inclusion of violin in that list. She made one wonder, &#8216;Kuzhal inidhaa, violin inidhaa?&#8217;Ramani and Thiyagarajan had made a conquest that day as the crowd stayed on till the end enjoying every bit of the concert. The accompanying artistes (Neyveli B.Venkatesh on the mridangam and Kovai V.Mohanram on the ghatam)  were   different avatars,  to suit the mood of the concert.
