VMusic concerts, a pattimandram and a play featured in the 38th  anniversary celebrations of Pollachi Tamizhisai Sangham, held at Mahatma Gandhi Mandapam, Pollachi. On the first day, Dr. Sahthiyaseelan acted as the mediator for the pattimandram and th\u000ae topic was &#8216;Should art just provide pleasure or uplift humanity?&#8217;R. Shannmugavadivelu and R.Madhu emphasised that art is meant only to entertain while A. Arivoli and Jothi Ramakrishna insisted that it has a duty towards society and humanity.The thought-provoking arguments were generously interspersed with humorous observations and anecdotes evoking  guffaws and the final verdict was that the purpose of art is to uplift humanity.Vasundhara Rajagopal&#8217;s voice increased in melody as the concert progressed and when she concluded with the mangalam, one wished she would go on for some more time. She had absolute control over the voice as it soared without any strain at the higher octaves. Most of her songs were in Tamil and there were some rarely heard kritis such as &#8216;Ennaiyum vara sonnaaro raghunaayakar&#8217; in Manirangu.Vibhishana is ecstatic when he hears that Sri Rama has agreed to see him. But he feels he does not deserve this honour and pours out his gratefulness to Rama in this song.Arunachalakkavirayar&#8217;s lyrical genius came alive in Vasundhara&#8217;s honeyed voice.After singing &#8216;Aaraadha arulamudham&#8217;, a viruttam in Brindavana saranga, she presented the eagerly expected &#8216;Ranga puravihaara&#8217; by Diksitar in all its glory. One got to hear &#8216;Kaaranam kettu vaadi&#8217;,  a popular number of the past  after many years. &#8216;Tha thai endraaduvaar&#8217; by Gopalakrishna Bharati was delightful. S.P. Anantha Padmanabha wielded his bow with sensitive understanding.Thiruvananthapuram Vaidhyanathan gave rhythmic support and presented an impressive tani.Lalgudi G.J.R. Krishnan and Lalgudi S.Vijayalakshmi, the torch bearers of the Lalgudi tradition, mesmerised the listeners with their melodious, laya-perfect music. They commenced and concluded their concert with the compositions of their guru and father Lalgudi Jayaraman.The varnam, &#8216;Innam en manam ariyaadhavar pola&#8217; in Charukesi, was a  continuous flow of melody that was pleasant but not torrential. The ragas Bahudari, (&#8216;Sadhaanandha thaandavam&#8217; by Achyutha Dasar), Saveri (&#8216;Muruga Muruga endraal&#8217; by Periyasamy Thooran), Shanmukhapriya (&#8216;Aandavane unai nambinen&#8217; by Papanasam Sivan) and Saramathi (&#8216;Mokhamu galadha&#8217; by Tyagaraja) were depicted with  depth and skill. But the crown  was Mohanam.While they presented &#8216;Kapaali&#8217; by Papanasam Sivan, melody reigned supreme, and the complicated swara phrases glided through their deft fingers. &#8216;Chinnanjiru kiliye Kannamma&#8217; is one of the eternal favourites of instrumentalists and Krishnan created a sort of record by playing &#8216;Kannamma&#8217; in innumerable ways, each more endearing than the other. Neyveli B.Venkatesh on the mridangam and Kovai V. Mohanram on the ghatam, who enjoyed playing,  contributed significantly to the success of the concert.
