VB. RAMADEVIDeepika Reddy, trained by guru Vempatti Chinna Sathyam, mesmerised the gathering at Mahatma Gandhi Mandapam, Pollachi. The  episodes from the life of Sri Krishna &#151;  `Vastrapaharanam' and `Govardhana Giri Dharanam' &#151;  gained graceful sophistication when Deepika presented them for the tarangam, `Govardhana Giridhara' by Narayana Tirtha.  She performed this piece involving intricate jathis on the rim of a brass plate.The padam by Kshetragna,  `Etuvanti Vade Vadu' and `Pravesha Dharuvu,' in typical Kuchipudi style revealed what a consummate dancer she is. She concluded her dance recital with a mangalam on the pancha bhutas (five elements) and a prayer for world peace.The efficient orchestra comprised Renuka Prasad (nattuvangam), Suryanarayana (vocal support), Sridharacharya (mridangam) and Saikumar (violin).Lively jathi patternsPurnima Ashok Kumar, a disciple of Ananda Shankar Jayant, began with `Aananda Narthana Ganapathim' in Gambhira Nattai by Oothukkaadu Venkatasubbaiyer.  In the course of the varnam by Lalgudi Jayaraman, she presented the episodes describing Draupadi's travails at the Kaurava court, Krishna's protecting her honour and Vishnu's incarnation as Vamana. The padam in Kapi entreating Krishna to come dancing on his little feet was a thing of beauty. Her tillana in Mohana Kalyani contained lively jathi patterns and graceful statuesque poses.Apsara Ramkumar and Supriya Rajan, (disciples of Gopika Varma), gave a perfect sample of Mohinyattom.  For the varnam, `Saarasa Sundara' in Neelambari they depicted `Gajendra Moksham'. The song, `Kaanthaa, Thava Pizha Naan Endhu Cheythu' was a masterpiece in feminine charm. Preethi Ramachandran's nattuvangam was graceful and K.S. Balakrishnan's vocal support was quite impressive. M. Ramanan on the mridangam, Nataraj on the flute and Nandakumar on edakka  created the right ambience for the dancers.Imaginative choreographyDivya Kasthuri from London,  a multi-faceted artiste, presented her Bharatanatyam recital as an offering to the goddess of Tamil. `Eduththa Kariyam Yavinum Vetri' was inspiring while the varnam in ragamalika, `Maatha Paraasakthi,' gave her a chance to display her mastery over nritta and nritya. The sanchari for the line `Vaiyamellaam Nee Nirainthaay' bore witness to meticulous and imaginative choreography.  For the mangalam, she chose the Thirukkural, `Vaiyaththul Vaazhvaangu Vaazhbavan' and concluded it with `Vaazhiya Senthamizh'.Madhumathi (nattuvangam),  Sai Sankar (vocal),  Nagai Narayanan (mridangam),  Sivakumar (flute) and Divya's mother (compere) gave excellent accompaniment. The festival organised by Pollachi Tamizhisai Sangam under the  presidentship of M. Manikkam and the  guidance of secretary Rm. V. Vellayappan, came to a close with this item.Bottom Template Starts
