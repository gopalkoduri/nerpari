VGanabharathi had arranged concerts\u000aby young artistes to mark\u000aShri Purandara Thyagaraja Sangithotsava\u000a- Tharunabharathi, at\u000aVeene Sheshanna Bhavana in Mysore.\u000aArtistes of unflinching dedication\u000adid their best in bringing the audience\u000aunder their sway.Sangitha Tharanathan's voice is\u000apleasing and expressive. It moves easily\u000ain the higher octaves. Yet, it muffled\u000anoticeably in the mandra, with a tinge\u000aof instability. As a result, the articulations\u000ain the madhya sthayi were an\u000aadmixture of both lively and arid\u000astrains."Paramathmudu Velige" (Vaagadhishwari\u000a- Thyagaraja) and "Raagarathnamaalika\u000aChe" (Rithigaula-\u000aThyagaraja) exposed her merits progressing\u000ainto maturity. Diction and\u000aright tempo contributed to enhance\u000athe mood. She sang an elaborate alapana\u000aof Rithigaula before introducing the\u000acomposition and later expanded the\u000alyrics at "Bhagavathothamulu".Sangitha (violin) and Keshava Sundar\u000a(mridanga) accompanied her, and\u000atheir endeavours remained consistently\u000aappreciable.***Chinmayi sang under the patronage\u000aof Bhramara Trust of Y.T. and\u000aMadhuri Thathachari Trust. It was a\u000amemorable occasion to the young vocalist\u000afrom Mumbai, to receive the\u000aBharatha Rathna Smt. M. S. Subbulakshmi\u000aAward instituted by the Trust\u000ain memory of the musical legend.Chinmayi, in the midst of scholarly\u000awitnesses, proved her mettle and\u000aworth. In spite of all these irrefragable\u000amerits, there remained some areas,\u000awarranting meticulous attention. Ragamalika\u000aPallavi, (unique with artistically\u000aembedded ragamudras),\u000a"Shankarabharanana karethodi baare\u000akalyani darbarige", (Kannada version\u000aof the famous Tamil Pallavi by Kunrakkudi\u000aKrishna Iyer) evinced a remarkable\u000aalapana. Thana too\u000aconformed to the required depth and\u000amajesty. The intricacies of the pallavi\u000adid not pose any hindrance. The\u000asmoothness and the subtleness with\u000awhich she negotiated the difficult\u000acurves while she traversed over different\u000aragas unequivocally won unreserved\u000aapplauses.Similarly, the moods also emerged\u000aspontaneously harmonising with both\u000athe ragas and the lyrics constituting\u000athe pallavi. In all these areas, violinist's\u000a(Veena Suresh) seasoned approach\u000aspoke of her professional depth.Nevertheless, the artiste could have\u000aplanned her concert to bring about a\u000abetter balance in fervour and impact,\u000aon the following grounds. She elaborated\u000aVasantha before presenting\u000aDikshitar's "Hariharaputram". However,\u000aa few passages of kalpanaswaras\u000awould have consummated the experience.\u000aIn this respect, instead of flooding\u000athe Varna ("Sami Ninne Kori" -\u000aShri - Karur Devudu Iyer) with kalpanaswaras,\u000ashe could have advantageously\u000aembellished Dikshitar's\u000acomposition, striking a better balance.Moreover, a pallavi of such a magnitude,\u000aas the one in the present instance\u000aenjoyed, expected detailed exposition,\u000awhich a short concert as this one could\u000anot accommodate. This naturally\u000aposed limitations restricting her extempore.Radhesh's mridanga resonated with\u000athe singer's timbre and synchronised\u000aadmirably with the musical ambience,\u000aall the artistes collectively created.
