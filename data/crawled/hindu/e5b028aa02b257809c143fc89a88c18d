VG. SWAMINATHANMusic indeed comes as a whiff of fresh air in today's hectic pace of life. Fully appreciating this fact, Gayathri Venkataraghavan presented a  comforting concert  comprising some of the rare kritis of Syama Sastri. The programme was arranged by Narada Gana Sabha and Saraswathi Vaggeyakkara Trust to mark Syama Sastri Day.The concert, which opened on a conspicuously slow tempo with `Parvathi Ninnu' in Kalgada, picked up some speed  with `Nannu Brova Rada' in Janaranjani, thanks to the fast rounds of swaras.It was the alapana of Begada   that flooded the rendition with  emotion as speed was completely eschewed.  With reposeful phrases, ornamented occasionally with exquisite brigas, Gayathri negotiated passages of beauty and brilliance.Charumathi Raghuraman (violin)  rose to the occasion with a finely etched Begada.The choice was `Sami Ninne Nammithira Ra Ra Muddukumara.'Gayathri presented the peerless swarajati `Kamakshi' in Yadukulakhambodi with fine touches and breathtaking pauses. The right speed, the appropriate punctuation, free articulation and restrained sangatis gave a mystic feel.Emphasis on majestyThe Thodi exposition was an energetic projection with emphasis mainly on its majesty. All the three regions were covered with powerful phrases knit in the right combination. The singer sprang a surprise here too through a composition on Dharmasamvardhani `Ema Ni Migula' with a venerable niraval and variety of swara combinations at `Pancha Nada Kaveri Theeramuna.'`Tarunam Eedamma' in Gowlibandu, `Pahi Sree Giriraja Sudhe' in Anandabhairavi and `Kanaka Saila Viharini' in Punnagavarali were also included in Gayathri's selections.On the whole, it was not just a recital but a sharing of musical wisdom with Gayathri steering clear of pedantic demonstrations.  Charumathi matched the mood with her responses on the violin, be it raga alapana, niraval or swaras.  Manoj Siva on the mridangam created the right rhythmic ambience for this perfect concert.Bottom Template Starts
