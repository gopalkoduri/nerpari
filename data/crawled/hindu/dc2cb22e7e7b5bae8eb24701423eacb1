VO.S.Thyagarajan was in his element when he sang at a concert in Palakkad recently.  With a full-throated robust voice, he treated the audience to a veritable feast of music, spanning the three octaves with uncanny ease. His fidelity to the accepted norms of Carnatic music tradition was visible throughout the concert.The opening varnam, &#8216;Sarasuda Ninne&#8217; of Kottavaasal Venkatrama Iyer in Saveri, followed by &#8216;Seethapathe,&#8217; a kriti of Tyagaraja in Kamas, formed a grand beginning. The swift tempo continued, as the artiste rendered &#8216;Birana Varalichi&#8217; in Kalyani, a composition of Shyama Sastri. The neraval and swaras at &#8216;Shyamakrishna Sodhari&#8217; were crisp and precise.The delineation of Poorvikalyani was classical to the core. The sancharas, centering on Gandhara in the upper octave, were a real treat. Oothukkadu Venkatasubba Iyer&#8217;s beautiful creation &#8216;Padmavathi Ramanam,&#8217; in praise of Jayadeva, the author of &#8216;Geetha Govindham,&#8217; was a good selection.The piece de resistance of the concert was a brilliant portrayal of Shanmugapriya and a poignant interpretation of Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Ekaambresa Naayakim.&#8217; The elongated kaarvais and gliding sangathis in the aalapana, with due accent on the jeeva swaras, brought out the raga bhava effectively. OST&#8217;s treatment of this enchanting raga was a  lesson for all aspiring students of music.OST paid, as it were, his homage to Tyagaraja, by rendering three of his Utsava Sampradaya krithis, &#8211; &#8216;Hecharikagaarara&#8217; in Yadhukukakambodhi, &#8216;Uyyala lugavayya&#8217; in Neelamabari and &#8216;Challare Ramachandrunipai&#8217; in Aahiri.The accompanists did a wonderful job, by extending excellent support. T.H.Subramanian on the violin distinguished himself creditably. His melodious raga and swara essays won accolades from the audience. The percussionists S.Thyagarajan (mridangam) and Udipi Sridhar (ghatam) performed exceedingly well. The concert was organised by The Palghat Fine Arts Society, Tharekkad.
