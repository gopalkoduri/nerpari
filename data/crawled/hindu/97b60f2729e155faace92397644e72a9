VBanyan Tree Events is back with its monsoon festival of music, Barkha Ritu: Celebrate Rains... Celebrate Life.... The one-day event takes place this coming Saturday, July 26, at the India Habitat Centre&#8217;s Stein auditorium. The artistes are Moha\u000an veena exponents Pandit Vishwamohan Bhatt and his son Salil Bhatt.The Mumbai-based Banyan Tree Events, in the field for more than a decade, prides itself on presenting rare, traditional Indian performing art forms and artistes from across the country. The Barkha Ritu festival was conceived and presented by Banyan Tree for the first time in 2003 at Mumbai. The underlying thought behind the festival is to suggest that we take a few moments to revel and experience the beauty of the monsoons through the rich bounty of Indian classical music. Having received tremendous success over the years for half a decade now, the Barkha Ritu festival has evolved into a major national monsoon music festival and is held across five cities: Mumbai, New Delhi, Pune, Hyderabad and Bengaluru.The Sixth Barkha Ritu festival is being presented to Delhi&#8217;s music lovers in association withThe Hinduand other corporate partners. Passes are available at the venue.Commenting on the Barkha Ritu festival, Mahesh Babu, Director, Banyan Tree Events, says, &#8220;Creating and organising festivals like Barkha Ritu is one of the ways by which we are making Indian classical music popular and very appealing to the common man, which is what our organisation stands for. What makes this festival special is that you can listen to monsoon raagas based on the theme of the monsoon that are not performed during the rest of the year.&#8221;Featuring:Pandit Vishwamohan Bhatt with Salil Bhatt Mohan VeenaDate:Saturday July 26 2008Time:7.30 p.m.Venue:Stein auditorium, India Habitat Centre
