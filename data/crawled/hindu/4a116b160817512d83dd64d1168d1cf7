VThe vocal concert of the Serugudi Sisters at Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanam was creditable because they included some compositions which are not often heard on concert platforms. A Tamil varnam in Atana provided a zestful start to the proceedings. Tyagaraja's &#8216;Ninne Bhajana' in Nattai and &#8216;Graha Balamemi' in Revagupti were pointers to the siblings' interest in projecting the raga images with emphasis on specific sangatis. A few strands of tepid swaras were affixed to the Revagupti kriti.Rema ventured on the elaboration of Rishabhapriya with motifs strong enough to distinguish it from Charukesi. &#8216;Mahathmule Teliyaleruni' by Mysore Vasudevachar augured well with the dynamism of the kriti adding swara sallies on &#8216;Mahi Sudha', the anupallavi line. The niraval surfaced only in the Ritigowla kriti of Tyagaraja &#8216;Chera Ravathe', on &#8216;Talli Tandri Leni Bala Tana Nathu' with swaras; but here, notwithstanding a melodic raga like Ritigowla, the niraval fell short of emotional aspect.Well-rehearsedThe core piece was Madhyamavati, which was taken up by Geetha as preface to the Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Venkatesa Ninnu'. Here the swaras were on the pallavi and moved to the extended kuraippu swara sorties with &#8216;sadhjam' as the landing note. All swara exchanges in this concert were concluded by both the sisters, with well rehearsed and impressive korvais. On the positive side, the sisters articulate well with full throated expressions. Rationally speaking, they recite well but the missing part is the internalisation of any raga or song which would add charm to the raga, kriti or swara. Well, spontaneity is different from a forced synthetic approach.The fast paced phrases in raga alapana and swara surges can temporarily impress the audience; but it is the evenness in the alapana and how the raga is spread out that will help the performers in the long run. Both Rishabapriya and Madhyamavati were good treatises but offered nothing special or specific to muse or ruminate over later either by the rasika or the singers. This statement holds good for the theoretically correct interpretations of songs sans soul too.With the voices almost identical, sweet and in their control, experience should impart the importance of searching for the spirit and sharing the same with the listener&#8230;this is musical wisdom. Hope Rema and Geetha learn this. A few more pleasing kritis were in their kitty; &#8216;Srihari Vallabhe' in Suddha Dhanyasi by Mysore Vasudevachar, &#8216;Ranganayakam' in Nayaki by Dikshitar, &#8216;Manavyala' in Nalinakanti by Tyagaraja and &#8216;Smarajanaka' in Behag by Swati Thirunal were worth recording.Kovai Chandran more or less presented the raga images in the same style as that of the sisters, offering sound without much soul. Kalakkad R. Srinivasan and Rajaraman on the mridangam and the ghatam provided able support and a tad aggressively framed &#8216;thani'.
