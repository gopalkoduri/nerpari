VThe inaugural concert by the ensemble H.K.Venkatraman (violin) G. Ravikiran (flute) and Aswin Anand (veena) in the Sri Krishna Gana Sabha Gokulakshtami series was classic in content and exhilarating for the listeners. There was exquisite harmony  and\u000a not a note was out of place in their joint interpretative presentation. It was the uniform gracefulness linked to high standard that compelled rapt attention. There was no assertiveness or over-indulgence in their exposition but an elegant persuasive amiability.The kutcheri was one of substance by the judicious selection of songs. Discarding the present day ritual of a first kala varnam that spells instant dullness to the start of a concert the Bangalore artistes chose the Sriraga varnam in brisk pace in the second kala which was maintained throughout the recital. The performance was not sheer energetic profusion, but served to  evoke instrumental aesthetics. It was a cohesive exposition of violin maturity, flute fluidity and veena delicacy.The programme started on a strong note with two kirtanas, &#8216;Pranamaamyaham&#8217; (Gowri) and &#8216;Ganamurte&#8217; (Ganamurthi). The way the trio played these songs was the reward for their spartan discipline. It created an impression of sincerity and experience which helped them scale greater heights in the song-session that followed.The first raga essay was Purvikalyani (&#8216;Gnanamosagarada&#8217;) taken up mainly by the veena artiste Ashwin Anand. His sensitive development deep in tone and rakti-ridden was in fact a precursor to a Thodi that came later.Though Thodi was shared among the three, the initial phase handled by Ashwin Anand laid great emphasis on clipped phrasings and the tranquil emotion they evoked.  It was an approximation to vocal style. Ashwin made sure that each sanchara served to unfold the raga&#8217;s graces and shades through compulsive tenderness. The madhyama sthayi and tara sthayi segments taken up by flute and violin saw to it that they kept up the classy mood set by the veena.The kirtana was &#8216;Sri Krishnam Bhaja Maanasa.&#8217;  &#8216;Annapoorne,&#8217; (Sama) was supremely poiseful, rendered with melodic restraint. If good music is one that lingers in the hearts of listeners, the kutcheri by Venkatraman and his team mates had to be saluted as exceptionally brilliant.Venkatraman (violin) the leader was extremely subdued to enable the flute and veena artistes to showcase their equipment. His contribution now and then was uplifting to the others. The confidence and surety with which flute Ravikiran played was enough to proclaim his well-shaped ability.Srimushnam Raja Rao was the mridangist. Raja Rao is synonymous with percussive exuberance which overflowed even while the veena player was presenting the swaraprastara in solo. The gentle tone of the veena was almost drowned in the mridangam beats. Rao&#8217;s robust padding while accompanying veena and flute was, however, remarkable. He was associated with the ghatam player H. Sivaramrishnan, most of the time really in the backstage.
