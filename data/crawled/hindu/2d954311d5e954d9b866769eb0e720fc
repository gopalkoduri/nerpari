VEvery style of music generally gets confined to a particular group in the matter of appreciation. It is in this respect that Sanjay Subramanian kept up his combative flamboyance to titillate his flock. The air of familiarity was to be seen in his kutcheri during the Bharat Sangeet Utsav of Carnatica held in association with Parthasarathy Swami Sabha.The idea behind this objective was understandable because the way he constructed alapanas and rendered songs was to make them appear heavier. Mellowness, the vital quality of music, had never been his preference. The beauty of his bhani was not so much in exposition as in his struggle to bring out his ideas.Even though he tried to introduce new performing techniques in the selection of songs and alapanas, the format continued to be conservative. With no full-stop to aggressiveness, audacious sancharas studded the vinyasa of Kangeyabhushini (&#8216;Evvare Ramayya&#8217;) which gave the extra dimension to his deliberate display of vidwat. Sometimes, his assertiveness stings but has the potency to excel.Similarly criss-crossing sancharas in the main item Thodi served to stamp enormity. A large part of the tara sthayi excursions was by way of uncoiling bravura passages with a very thin coating of sensitivity. The Thodi suite, raga, kirtana &#8216;Enduku Dayaradura&#8217;, niraval and swaras formed the ebullient part of the concert which got specifically outlined in every note. This flair and fervour provided the driving force which he relished with abandon; though it suggested a state of tension between his manodharma and vocal disability to meet it.Earlier, he sang Sahana. There was vigour in his alapana with very little essential grace that such a raga as Sahana called for. The concept and development with expressional aplomb were in keeping with his musical make-up. The kirtana was &#8216;Kamalaambikaayaam.&#8217;A violin accompanist enjoys a general advantage. However much he tries, he cannot raise the decibel level of the violin tone beyond its natural limit. So Varadarajan&#8217;s solo exercises were pleasantly soothing though he reflected Sanjay&#8217;s verve fully. Also, he could have imparted his own excellence in his play.B. Harikumar (mridangam) and Sanjay seemed to be made for each other in exuberance and exaltation of punching impressiveness. As is the case in all kutcheris, the upa-pakkavadhyam ghatam by Guru Prasad was an &#8216;also ran.&#8217;
