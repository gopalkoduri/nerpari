VCarnatic music is an art form that has a good degree of spirituality built in; the compositions of the Trinity and other great composers are outpourings of their steadfast devotion to the Almighty.Many past masters who gave brilliant performances, had reverence for their art and every concert of theirs was an acid test. Deviation from accepted standards of sampradaya was taboo, though they did not curtail their manodharma. Entertaining the audiences was secondary. Classicism was at the forefront and dilution of music for the sake of entertainment was a rarity.The past and present centuries have witnessed Carnatic music being offered by select musicians with the aim of reaching out to those uninitiated in the niceties of classical music.Violin entertainsKunnakudi Vaidyanathan succeeds in his aim to entertain in this album. The medley of sounds emanating from his bow and the fingers are reflective of the sadhakam he has put in.The album begins with the soulful &#8216;Sidhivinayakam' (Chamaram-Muthuswamy Dikshitar). This is quickly followed by an outline of Kharaharapriya extending on to Tyagaraja's &#8216;Pakkala Nilabadi.' The brief swaraprastaras are generally precise without being overdone.The opening of Purandaradasa's &#8216; Venkatachalanilayam' (Sindhubhairavi) is a trifle different from the popular version. The succeeding compositions are &#8216;Kaividamattan' (Valaji-Gopalakrishna Bharati) and &#8216;Ninne Namminanu' (Thodi-Syama Sastri), which are played with exaggerated bhava. There is an aura of lighter raga touches in a heavy Carnatic raga like Thodi.Mohanam (&#8216;Ramanai Kannara'-Arunachala Kavi) has a chain of solfa passages mounted on the pallavi. The bow is given a rest and the violin is played with both hands. Vaidyanathan's mission of entertaining his listeners is fulfilled in this segment.Oothukkadu Venkatasubbaier's &#8216;Adathu Asangadu' (Madyamavathi) and the violinist's tillana in Mishra Revathi bring this disc to a close. There are strong hints of Vedic chants interwoven with the jatis in the tillana. The accompanists are M. Ganapathy (mridangam), R. Kalyanaraman (ghatam), T.K. Dakshinamurthy (ganjira), Pudukottai Mahadevan (morsing) and S.M.S. Rajamani (tambura).
