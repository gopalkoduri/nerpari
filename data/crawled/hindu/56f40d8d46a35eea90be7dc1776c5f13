VThe annual Tyaga Brahma Aradhana celebration of Tyaga Brahma Gananjali was inaugurated in the precincts of Sree Venugopalaswami temple by G.Lakshmipathi, eminent Cardiologist of Coimbatore. The distinguished speaker spoke of Tyagaraja&#8217;s humour \u000apresent in his compositions while pointing out that the bard of Thiruvaiyaru was basically a human being like the rest of humanity.The vocal recital of Bombay sisters, C.Saroja and C. Lalitha, following the event was characterised by their adherence to tradition. The songs of Tyagaraja are both fascinating and beautiful for their lyricism and the siblings demonstrated their honed patanthara and kutcheri skills.The opening kriti, &#8216;Raghunayaka&#8217; (Hamsadhwani) garnished with swaras rendered in the right proportion set the tempo and the following &#8216;Mokshamugalada&#8217; in Saramathi was rendered with bhava.Lalitha&#8217;s alapana of Simhendramadhyamam for the song &#8216;Natajanaparipalaka&#8217; was an effortless essay doing justice to tara sthayi. The kriti was fortified by a competent niraval and swaras on the line, &#8216;Sruthimoralita.&#8217; Saroja&#8217;s delineation of raga Madhyamavathi for the kriti, &#8216;Vinayakuni&#8217; included melodic phrases to bring out its charming splendour and imposing grandeur. &#8216;Orjoo Jupu&#8217; in kannadagowlai was rendered with solemnity.Balasubramaniam&#8217;s violin accompaniment stressed mellifluousness. His portrayal of Madhyamavathi was enthralling. Percussion support from Prakash (mridangam) and Suresh (ghatam) brought delights of laya exuberance with their euphonious beats.
