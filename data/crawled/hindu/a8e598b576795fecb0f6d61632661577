VT. K. GANAPATHYThe delightful and spellbinding violin duet of Akkarai Subbulakshmi and Swarnalatha featured by Rajalakshmi Fine Arts was a remarkable testament to their commitment.  Their play was full of expressions of warmth and every number they played had a unique charm. Their Nadopasana demonstrated their deep understanding of the classicism of Carnatic music.The young duo's interpretation of "Endaro Mahanubhavulu" in Sree Ragam as invocatory song was sheathed in elegance and grace and it sparkled with ascetic flavour. "Swaminatha Paripalayamaam" in Naattai with swaras was exalted in appeal.Subbalakshmi's joy and passion for the art was evident in the Bhairavi alapana for the swarajati, "Kamakshi" engulfed with a flood of mellifluous phrasings and the rendition was full of bhava, lyrical excellence and devotional fervour.The essence of Charukesi was offered by Swarnalatha in all majesty for the kriti, "Aadamodi Galade."The melodic strains of "Raghuvamsasudha" created a tranquillising ambience.AestheticThe highlight of the programme was RTP in the Pratimadhyama raga, Dharmavathi, in Kanda triputa tala steeped in aesthetics.The raga sancharas in Varamu, Bahudari, Hamsanadham and Kaapi with honeyed phrases drew wide applause.The tani by Satishkumar (mridangam) and Guru Prasad (ghatam) was poetry in rhythm.Bottom Template Starts
