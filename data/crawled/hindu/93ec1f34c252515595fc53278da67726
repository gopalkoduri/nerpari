VB.R.C. IYENGARIt is too well known that the quality and presentation of classical Carnatic music is undergoing an alarming change in the recent past. Whether it is for the good or not so good is a subject of big debate.  If the older generation feels sore about it and the contemporary sense the metamorphism as a way of thinking and expression, they are matters of opinion. In the process however, the aesthetics, spirituality, grammar and even melodic content are taking a severe beating. The very term "tradition" is being hotly questioned. That the trend (pantha) and format of a concert as conceived by past masters  like Ariyakudi, and accepted, need not necessarily be the only correct concept.To discuss these and many more related issues Nada Sudha Tharangini (Hyderabad), under the leadership of Nedunuri Krishnamurthy,  , has started an ambitious programme of reviving the traditional values of Carnatic music.Nada Sudha Tharangini started with a bang the `Music Awareness Programme' in the name Saampradaaya Sangitha Vaibhavam on May 13 This  programme of music awareness and appreciation  was inaugurated by Malladi Chandrasekhara  Sastry with a religious discourse, bringing out the importance of classical music and thevaggeyakaara baaniwhich was losing its identity in today's entertainment media.He insisted that every youth should come forward in this Yagya and elevate the value of our culture and tradition through music and devotion. This was followed by a vocal recital by  K. Seshulatha. The Tharangini intends to have regular meetings followed by concerts based on tradition and discuss related matters. Nedunuri has taken particular interest in the programmes to come.Bottom Template Starts
