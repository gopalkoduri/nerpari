VKanyakumari opened with an invocation, the traditional Deekshitar composition in Nata -Mahaganapathim&#8217; . The next numberRamabhakti Samrajyamof Thygaraja in Suddha Bangala sounded highly expressive. Kanyakumari has the knack of projecting the sahitya bhava too on her violin . The first raga effort by Kanyakumari was &#8216;Lalitha&#8217; forHiranmayimof Dikshitar with neraval and swaram at the line&#8217;Sangeetha Vadya Vinodini&#8217;. This was well laid-out presentation in every part of its lyrical and technical possibilities. The raga oozed out melody . After a briskNiravadhi Sukhadain Ravichandrika of Thyagaraja, she opened the major showpiece of the concert that too as an experimental offering &#8211; ragam, tanam, pallavi in &#8216;Valaji&#8217;. The violinist added another raga &#8216;Nagaswaravali&#8217; and intertwined them alternately. It was a brilliant exercise, resulting in a thrillingly melodic novelty.  The pallavi wasJayarama Rama Sitarama Ramain &#8216;Adi&#8217; talam. The swaraprasthara was done as a &#8216;Ragamalika&#8217;, a real garland of nine ragas , viz. &#8216;Abhogi, Kalyani, Sahana, Subhapantuvarali, Kapi, Anandabhairavi, Priyadarshini, Niroshtham and Hindolam&#8217;.Kanyakumari made the latter part of her recital also interesting for she played popular numbers that the audience could easily identify like Annamacharya composition.tandanana hurein &#8216;Bowli&#8217;.,Venkatachalain &#8216;Bhairavi&#8217;,Om namo Narayanayain &#8216;Karnaranjani&#8217;, a Tamil composition in &#8216;Madhuvanti&#8217; and an Ayyappa bhajan and a Western tune.
