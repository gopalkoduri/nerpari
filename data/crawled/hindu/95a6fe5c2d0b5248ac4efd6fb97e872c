VA. SANGAMESWARANCreative innovations in perfect harmony with aesthetical sense can elevate an artiste to peaks of excellence  and thereby enthuse an audience also. Sita Rajan of Chennai belongs to that particular genre of musicians; as a performer and teacher she has succeeded in both areas.Absorbing the lessons she learnt from the masters  -   Semmangudi, Musiri, D.K. Jayaraman, Mukhtha and Bheemsankar Rao  -   of both Carnatic and Hindustani streams, she has evolved a style to become an accomplished artiste in her own right. Her concert at Nadopasana, Irinjalakuda, was a treat torasikas,right from the starting varnam (`Eranapai' in Thodi) to the final bhajan (`Visweswara' in Sindhu Bhairavi).Rapport with the audiencePerhaps, among other plus points, Sita's virtuosity and ability to feel the pulse of an audience may  have played a role in her being chosen for the Sangeetha Kala Acharya award of Music Academy, Chennai.Varnam was followed by `Saraseeruhasana priye' (Natta) and `Ennaganu Rama Bhajana (Panthuvarali). A comprehensivealapanaof Mukhari, soaked in the  essence of the rakthi raga, was followed by the number `Pahimam Rathnachala nayaka.' The way  she delineated the two kritis, both in rendering thesahithyaand the pace, was a testimony of her passion for  Dikshitar kritis.The stateliness of her rendition was evident  as in between these two slow tempo kritis, she  sang three medium tempo kritis  -   `Marukelara' (Jayanthasree), `Kaa vaa vaa' (Varali) and `Padavini sadbhakthi' (Saalaga Bhairavi). A finealaapanaof Saveri  blossomed next and it was tagged on to the  rare Syama Sastri kriti `Sreepathimukha.'R. Swaminathan, who accompanied on the violin, played  a neat essay of Saveri and Mukhari.  Mahesh Kumar, on the mridangam, played delicately in perfect unison with the flow and pace of the concert.The fag end of the concert consisted of `Kandaranubhoothi' (Bihak), `Chaliye kunjane' (Brindavana Saranga), `Visweswara' (Sindhubairavi) and a Thillana in Vasantha by Poochi Sreenivasa Iyengar.Bottom Template Starts
