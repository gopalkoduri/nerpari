VVada Arangam Padaippagam has released CDs under the series, "Nalam Tharum Nadhaswaram."Alangudi A.V.P.Packrisamy and Alangudi A.V.P.Gopalakrishnan on the nagaswaram take the credits in one such CD titled `Sri Lakshmi Varaham'.They are accompanied on the thavil by Senthamangalam A. Manigandan and Perambalur N. Manigandan. Etching Malayamarutham's splendour, Packrisamy plays Tyagaraja's `Manasa' with grace. His foray into its phrases here, add lustre. It is the same again with Kedaram (`Sakalakala'-Adi-Sudhananda Bharati).His delineation of Mayamalavagowla, full of subtleties and aesthetics is pleasing, followed by a melodious `Deva Deva' (Rupakam-Swati Tirunal). Packrisamy signs off with an imaginative detailing of Abhogi (`Sri Lakshmi Varaham'-Adi-Dikshitar). The swaraprasthara explores the raga's colours, sans any arithmetics.Thani has the Manigandans weaving interesting patterns and sollukattu.In praise of Rama`Laavanya Raama'  has Nachiarkoil N.R.P.Ravichandran on the nagaswaram with J. Manigandan. Tirunaraiyur T.V.Dhaskhinamurthy and Kudavasal K.S.Arulkumar play the tavil. They offer a total Tyagaraja fare in praise of Lord Rama. Starting with `Varanaradha' (Vijayasri-Adi), Ravichandran presents a neat sketch of Sahana (`Vandanamu,' Adi) Kalyana Vasantham essayed briefly is followed by a sincere rendition of `Nadhaloludai' (Rupakam). Jayanthasri (`Marugelara,' Adi) that comes next could have been placed later due to its closeness to the scale of Kalyana Vasantham.The other items include  `Bhavanutha' (Mohanam, Adi), `Nagumomu' (Abheri, Adi) and `Laavanya Raama' (Poornashadjam, Rupakam).A  striking aspect of both the albums is the pause between the phrases given by the vidwans while essaying a raga. Such pauses are needed to create a meditative mood.Credit must be given to Ganesh Ramanna of Digi Tracks Studio, who has used the reverb cleverly to give the rasika a feeling of listening to a nagaswaram recital in a late night temple procession.V.
