VShantala Subramanyam&#8217;s flute recital exhibited  her as an artist of self-expression whose playing style had the desirable impact of the vocal bhani.It was learnt that she had her vocal lessons under  Vairamangalam Laksminarayanan (now under  OST) and that proved many a point. She seemed to have realised that there exists a distinction between dynamic and inspirational influence and an imitative path that curbs and shuts originality.The &#8216;home-traits&#8217; (She is the sister of flautist Shashank) were minimal and never copied on to her performance. She was able to maintain a remarkable uniformity in the intensity of her blowing.She began with the Ata tala varnam in Khambodi negotiating with clarity of swaras the two speeds. &#8216;Pahi Pahi Bala Ganapathe&#8217; (Mazhavai Chidambara Bharathi-Hamsadhwani) which has a graceful lullaby-like orientation had swaras at the pallavi. &#8216;Anupama Gunambudhi&#8217; (Tyagaraja-Atana) was played next with a small alapana and the sangatis rendered in copybook style were followed with vigour by the laya vidwans.The raga alapana for Malayamarutham (&#8216;Dhanyudevvado,&#8217; Patnam Subramanya Iyer) had several points of excellence.  She even ventured to deploy the bass flute though this rasika records his mild disapproval about its use for Carnatic ragas. Hindustani melodies rivet one&#8217;s attention when rendered on the Bansuri with its quiet nadham and low pitch.&#8216;Ninne Nammithinayya&#8217; (Mysore Vasudevachar-Simhendramadhyamam) had an elaborate alapana and the kalpanaswara session had many fine korvais of breathtaking complexity given her propensity towards this segment and her specially developed skills in  that direction. At times, there tended to emerge a rehearsed atmosphere that lacked spontaneity.Shantala signed off with a Jhavali in Khamas (&#8216;Marubaari&#8217;-Dharmapuri Subbarayar) and &#8216;Nadhupai Palikeru&#8217; (Tyagaraja-Madhyamavathi).Ganesh Prasad who accompanied her on the violin showed analytical alertness during the alapanas and swarprastharams. He  possesses the special art and tact that is much needed for an accompanying artist.Satish Kumar on the mridangam and Guruprasad on the ghatam followed delectably, with precise stops at karvais, during the swaraprastharams. Their thani had many experimental usages where sollus were elongated, reversed in order of presentation and ended with an edge-of the-seat korvai of exemplary quality. But still a small hall needed more attention on the aesthetic control of decibel levels. The concert dedicated to Mali - the flautist nonpareil &#8211; was held under the banner of The International Foundation for Carnatic Music, at Sastri Hall.
