VThe flute concert by Dr. Vijayagopal marked the F. G. Natesa Iyer Memorial Day, organised by the Rasika Ranjana Sabha in Tiruchi recently.The late Natesa Iyer was the founder of the R. R. Sabha.Dr. Vijayagopal, was accompanied by AIR artist, Ramanujacharyalu on the violin, &#8216;Palladam' Ravi on the mridangam and Rajaganesh on the ganjira.Starting briskly in Nalinakanti (&#8216;Manaviyalu'), the flautist presented &#8216;Varana' in Vijayashri with grace.He travelled extensively in Mohanam (Ra Ra Rasiva) with silky swara sallies and ended the concert with a Behag kriti (&#8216;Muruganin Marupeyar').Ramanujacharyalu rendered good support on the violin and the youthful thani by &#8216;Palladam' Ravi and Rajaganesh was classic.
