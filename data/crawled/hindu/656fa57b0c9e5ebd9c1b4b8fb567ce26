VThe inimitable Kanyakumari opened her &#8216;Violin Panchakam' an innovative concert with five violinists, with the ragam Hamsadhwani ( Vatapi Ganapatim&#8230;). What followed was a brief (going by her regular recital standards!) one hour plus instrumental bonanza tuned to the occasion.The repertoire was full of popular classical numbers as she was playing to the staff, students and guests of Vignana Jyoti Institutions Fest.The Pancharatna kriti in Sri ragam Endaro Mahanubhavulu&#8230; struck the right chord in as much as it sounded the welcome note as well as launched into one of the most famous and revered Thyagaraja kritis. With four of her pupils (M. Rajeev, Anand, Dinesh Kumar and Vithal Rangan) providing her with ample support and testifying to her prowess at teaching through their own virtuosity, Kanyakumari went on to regale her audience with Brochevarevaru raa ninu vina (a Mysore Vasudevachariar kriti) in Kamas. Her violin provided the emotive nuances of this wonderful lyric especially in the second stanza which is replete with plea and pathos. The five violins synchronized to a T.Annamacharya's Tandanana&#8230;' in Bowli found immediate response in the listeners whose joy was visible in the nodding and tapping the fingers in tune with the song.Wafts of melody began flowing in a series with the Navaratna kanada ( Ninnu vina&#8230;), Kuntalavarali (Swati Tirunal's Bhogeendara Sayana&#8230; ), and Abheri ( Nagumomu&#8230;). The violinists' deft bowing contributed to embellishing these beautiful ragas with fine improvisation.The laya vinyasam with drums (Shankar) to beat, was the highlight of the evening. K.V. Prasad on the mridangam and Amrut on the kanjira gave a compelling response in solo and in unison to the thundering drums. It was a three-way contest between the trio and had the audience hooked on to their chairs.The Raghupati Raghava Rajaram in Kapi was a fitting finale to this shower of instrumental melody.
