VPattabhirama Pandit (SPVGMC Trust) mesmerised the Mysore audience treating them with music, ideally classical, and exemplarily traditional. It was not just his voice or the scholarship, but a charming artistry and an unassuming simplicity chiselled to taste, which appealed to the senses.What was special in him? In the first instance, it was his understanding of the gravity and the dignity of the numbers he had chosen for interpretation, both in their abstract and concrete senses. In the second instance, the manner in which he materialised such a concept &#8212; methodical and emotive elaborations of the ragas laid down a firm foundation on which the specificities of the numbers emanated grandly.Further, factors like appropriate tempo, clear diction and proportionate embellishments made a significant difference in setting apart his musical personality as unique and exemplary, meeting the requirements of both the laity and the leaned.Take for example either Dikshitar's &#8220;Siddhi Vinayakam Anisham&#8221; (Chamara/Shanmukhapriya) or Thyagaraja's &#8220;Dasharathe&#8221; (Thodi), both vouching for all the observations made above. In the alapana sections the articulations assumed varied dimensions, matching with the level of the octaves the artiste was traversing.The ideas would not repeat; an admirable phenomenon that sustained interest and curiosity throughout the progressions.Nilugades and the pauses served as extensions either of the meanings of the lyrics or of the moods of the ragas under interpretation. And with this as a rule, continuity in fervour and experience incessantly prevailed in the presentations, rendering each as one comprehensive unit. Absorbingly drawn neravals at the anupallavi of &#8220;Siddhi Vinayakam&#8221; (Siddha Yaksha) and charana of &#8220;Dasharathe&#8221; (Bhaktileni) worked almost like full-fledged pallavis, in core and content, allowing sufficient scope for the listeners to enjoy and muse over those accomplishments.One never felt saturated with the extensively woven swarakalpana at any time. The indispensable element of swara bhaava (a rarity) he infused into the swaras individually and the swara-phrases collectively, played an immense role in such spontaneous tuneful activities. Saralevarase, jantivarase or the alankaras in their different combinations and permutations evolved into mature musical expressions, and mathematics transformed into mature artistry by the fluently unfurling extempore.The melody accompanist's (violin-Mysore M. Nagaraj) prompt reciprocations and the percussionists' (mridanga by B. Ravishankar and khanjira by Vyasavithala) special effects were always in readiness to bring the numbers in general, and movements in particular, to their intended climaxes.The audience also enjoyed compositions like Viriboni (Bhairavi-&#8220;Pachimiriam Adi Appayya&#8221;), &#8220;Annapurne&#8221; (Saama-Dikshithar), and &#8220;Vidajaladura&#8221; (Janaranjani-Thyagaraja) and so on.Nevertheless, moments of striving to reach very high octaves, under the spell of surging extempore and imagination appeared awkward and unnecessary, though not disturbing.
