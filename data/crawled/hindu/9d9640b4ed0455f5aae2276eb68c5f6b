VThe distinctive features of the concert of O.S. Thyagarajan for Hamsadhwani   were sustained energy, restrained flourish, perfect sruti and swara, stimulation of stage and audience alike, appealing formatting, in-depth development, and excellent time management &#8212; evidence of experience and maturity born of years of professionalism.Supported by Delhi Sunderrajan and J. Vaidyanathan, OST carried the concert from its inceptive phase, with three madhyamakala krtis with glittering manodharma revealed in well-contained niraval and kalpanaswara &#8211; &#8216;Brochevarevare&#8217; (Sriranjini, Adi, Vasudevachar); &#8216;Sujana Jeevana&#8217; (Khamas, Rupakam, Tyagaraja) and &#8216;Ninne Nammi Nanura&#8217; (Pantuvarali, Rupakam, Tyagaraja, preceded by alapana) through a transitory phase in &#8216;Enraikku Sivakripai varumo?&#8217; (Mukhari, Adi, Nilakanta Sivan, taken from the Anupallavi &#8216;Kanrin Kuralai Kettu&#8217;), which paved the way for the deliberate development of Mohanam.OST chose to elaborate the raga at the higher notes despite his booming voice lending itself admirably to mantrasthayi sancharas.Beginning his sketch with the stroke &#8216;ga pa dha pa/ga-ri, sa...,&#8217; he quickly moved up, to cover the madhya and tara sthayis before descending to the lower notes at which he concluded his bit. One could imagine that the rationale of this scheme was perhaps that the composition which he settled for would have a take-off at bass notes. This appeared to be the case as he took up Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Nanu Palimpa,&#8217; whose range sweeps the scale from the gandhara to the lower panchama.Sunderrajan delivered an enjoyable alapana after this, although one felt his sancharas were lacking in direction, with some sangatis sounding disjointed (though rendered well). After completing the song, OST returned to the anucharanam lines &#8216;Karamuna Kodandakantito&#8230;&#8217; for niraval; one of the subtleties in this niraval was that the transition from its slow phase to duritham was hardly detectable.It was great pleasure  listening to OST&#8217;s simple karvais extending the note of the concluding swaras in any passage, alapana or kriti, through at least half of an avartanam, which makes for musical continuity, and used to be a common practice with musicians of earlier times.Combined with Sunderrajan playing the lower octave of whatever note OST was singing, and JV going on with simple sollus, the music was  elevated.  JV&#8217;s tani avartanam was a short sketch of Adi talam, commencing with tisram and going on to chatusram.The artist concluded his recital with two short melodies, &#8216;Naale Nalla Naal&#8217; in Kapi and &#8216;Uyyala Looga Vaiya, Sri Rama&#8217; in Neelambari, aptly in the words of Tyagaraja, who entreats Rama to condescend to sway to his music.
