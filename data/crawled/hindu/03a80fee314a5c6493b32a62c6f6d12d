VR. Vedavalli began the series with her dignified recital, accompanied by Charulatha Ramanujam (violin), Kovai G. Prakash (mridangam) and Kovai G. Suresh (ghatam).Neyveli Santhanagopalan presented the kirtanas set to  Melakarta ragas on the second day. V.V.Ravi (violin), Salem Srinivasan (mridangam) and Kovai S.V.Subramaniam (kanjira) provided him support.When Seetha Rajan began her concert on the third day, with &#8216;Nadha Thanum Anisham&#8217; (Chittaranjani), clearly splitting the phrase bringing out the meaning that Sankara has nadha as His body, the audience sat up with interest. After eulogising on the efficacy of Ramabhakthi in &#8216;Appa Rama Bhakti&#8217; (Panthuvarali) she sang &#8216;Elaa Nee Daya Radhu&#8217; (Atana), in which Tyagaraja demands to know why He can&#8217;t show him mercy. But that mood was totally changed when Seetha Rajan began her lovely alapana of Thodi and let Tyagaraja plead with Rama to drink some milk (&#8216;Aaragimpave&#8217;). Her delineation of Subhapanthuvarali made many eyes moist and she followed it up with &#8216;Ennallu Oorage&#8217; in which the saint decides to wait and see for how long Rama would keep quiet ignoring him.She presented a few rare songs, &#8216;Ethuda Nilichithe&#8217; (Sankarabharanam), &#8216;Paluku Kanda Sakkare&#8217; (Navarasa Kannada) and &#8216;Nama Kusumamula&#8217; (Sriragam).Even though many of Tyagaraja&#8217;s kritis have more than one charanam, musicians usually sing only one. Seetha Rajan sang an additional charanam beginning with &#8216;Yaga Rakshana&#8217; for &#8216;Ela Nee Daya Radhu&#8217;. There were also the usual favourites such as &#8216;Bantureeti Koluvuviyavayya&#8217; (Hamsanadham), and &#8216;Vandanamu Raghunandana&#8217; (Sahana). During the alapanas and swarakalpanas, she established her Semmangudi bani. She never drew attention to her skill but projected the beauty of the raga instead. B.U. Ganesh Prasad on the violin (His raga delineations were extremely melodious) and Neyveli Skanda Subramaniam on the mridangam gave excellent support.On the day of Sri Thyaga Brahma aradhana, unchavrithi bhajan, abhishekam and singing of pancharatna kritis brought the feeling of Tiruvaiyaru to  Coimbatore.In the evening,  Saketaraman began with &#8216;Dudukugala&#8217; (Gowla), the second Pancharatnam. Blessed with a clear voice and faultless diction, Saketaraman won  the hearts of  listeners instantly.  His swarakalpanas were interesting and intricate but presented in an unhurried manner, as if he was savouring each phrase before letting them out for others to enjoy.&#8216;Neevanti Deivamu&#8217; (Bhairavi) and &#8216;Etavunara&#8217; (Kalyani) were quite elaborate, while &#8216;Nannuvidichi Kadhalakura&#8217; (Ritigowla) was perfect. Tyagaraja cries out to the Lord in this kriti not to leave his side and never to let him down. Saketaraman gave a mood-setting delineation of the raga, but did not go in for niraval or swarakalpanas. He stopped at the right place, crystallising the melting mood provided by the kriti. He would have spoilt the effect if he had not done so. He sang &#8216;Ganamurthe&#8217; in praise of Krishna, the deity of Srivenugopalaswamy temple, which was the venue.&#8216;Challare Ramachandrunipai&#8217; (Ahiri) and &#8216;Shobane&#8217; brought the concert to an appropriate end. The ears had feasted on good music and the hearts were brimming with emotion. Kovai K.Balasubramaniam on the violin gave an excellent sample of his skill and experience. Palghat Harinarayan and H.Prasanna (on the mridangam and ghatam respectively) brought out fireworks with their youthful energy.Rudrapatnam Brothers R.N. Thyagarajan and R.N. Taranathan presented strictly traditional music. They began with &#8216;Telisi Rama Chinthanato&#8217; in Purnachandrika. After a detailed alapana of Panthuvarali, they presented &#8216;Apparama Bhakti&#8217;. &#8216;Shanthamuleka&#8217; in Sama and &#8216;Chetulara Shringaramu&#8217; in Bhairavi were beautiful. R.K.Sriram Kumar&#8217;s Bhairavi delineation was delectable, though interrupted by power cuts. Towards the end, the brothers sang &#8216;Uyalaloogavayya&#8217; (Nilambari), &#8216;Lavanya Rama&#8217; (Poornashadjam) and &#8216;Pathiki Harathee Re&#8217; (Surutti). The genius of R.K.Sriram Kumar and J.Vaidhyanathan (mridangam) along with the skill of other accompanists (A.S.Murali on the ghatam and A.S. Krishnan on the morsing) took the concert to great heights.On the final day, the organisers honoured  dedicated teacher C.H. Raghoothama Rao at a solemn function that was presided over by N.V. Nagasubramanian, advocate. The concluding concert was by A.S. Murali who was accompanied by Tiruchi R. Govindarajan (violin), Konerirajapuram V. Varadarajan (mridangam) and A.S. Krishnan (morsing).
