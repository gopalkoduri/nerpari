VA warm welcome was accorded to Vishwapriya, a new Sabha in Hyderabad, which hosted its first kutcheri featuring O.S. Thyagarajan. It was a joyous occasion, attended by the veterans of all other leading sabhas of the twin cities like &#8211; SICA, Kalasagaram, Sarada Cultural Trust  and Chandrasekarendra Sangeeta Society along with the rasikas that are regulars to the local kutcheries.One always gets the feeling that OST continues from where he left off the last time &#8211; last Saturday was no exception. He began the concert withVandehamin Hamsadwani in a brisk fashion.Seethamma Maayammain Vasantha came next with a satisfyingneravalat Dharanijabhagavatha. The rare krithi of Thyagaraja,Kamalapthakulain Brindavanasaranga was sung mellifluously. OST&#8217;s fine and absolute blending with Sruthi enhanced the listening pleasure.Poorvikalyani was the first raga chosen for elaboration by OST. He gave a complete picture of the raga while theakara pidisstood out. Vittal Ramamurthy exposition was immediate and crisp.Gnamosagarada, the grand piece of Thyagaraja took the centre stage and the neraval atParamathmudu Jeevathmuducame out very well. OST concluded  it with excellent single-avarthana kalpanaswarams.The acoustics of the TTD hall left a lot to be desired as it dished out echoes to the audience and low feedback to the performers. The mike too, at times, added to the agony. Allowing children to noisily run around, especially during thealapanashowed the Hyderabadrasikain poor light. All this did not deter a seasoned performer like OST to focus on the job at hand &#8211; and how he did it!It was Karaharapriya again making one wonder, &#8216;OST and Karaharapriya &#8211; again?&#8217; But OST&#8217;salapanaexposed different yet beautiful facades of this majestic raga. It was indeed a very elaborate and distinguished effort. AChakkanirajaorNatachiwas sorely missed when he picked up a toned-downOkkapariafter such an impressivealapana. Thesarwalagu swaraswere quite enjoyable. S. Thiagarajan played a scholarlythani.Varijanayanain Kedaragowla and a wee-bit fastSompainain Ahiri brought up the rear of the Kutcheri. OST gently ended the concert withOyyalaloogavayyain Neelambari.
