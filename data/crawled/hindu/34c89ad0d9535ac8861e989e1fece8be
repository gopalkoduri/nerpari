VThe group mainly rendered lyrics of legendary Amir Khusru. Occasionally, Bande Nawaz who sang and played the harmonium, involved the audience that enthusiastically clapped along with the troupe synchronising well with the rhythm on stage.The programme was organised by the South Central Railway - Vijayawada Division in connection with propagation of Rashtra Bhasha &#8211; Hindi.Nawaz&#8217;s troupe consisted of Amjad, Md. Asif, Md. Maqbool, and Mehmood. Zahid and Md.Liaquat supported superbly on tabla and dholak. It was thrilling to watch the team maintain perfect rhythm throughout with their clapping &#8211; a charming feature in qawwali &#8211; in perfect unison with the rhythm provided by the percussionists.Another attractive feature was the occasional and extemporesaki(solo) singing by the lead singer with traditional gestures. Janab Bande Nawaz sported a rich and appealing voice and led the group superbly.
