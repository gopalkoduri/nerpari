VA compact disc (CD) on the `Raamaayanam' in Tamil was released at Tiruchi  recently. The  VCD has  animated characters, numbering about 50, and centres around the main and popular events of the great epic.There is no Kaandam-wise compartmentalisation in the two CDs, as all the important events have been selectively chosen for projecting the entire epic."Animated characters kindle the interest of the viewers, especially the youth and children. We have ensured audio-visual effect by appending a specific music track effect for each character. Thus,  every time Lord Rama appears, it is preceded by a specific musical note," says N. Anandan, Managing Director, Dove Multimedia Pvt. Limited, Chennai,  which has brought out the  VCD.N. Nithyanandam has scripted the dialogue based on  Kamba Raamayanam. Kanmani Raja has directed the music, with special effects for the battle sequences.The duration of each VCD in the twin pack is 60 minutes.
