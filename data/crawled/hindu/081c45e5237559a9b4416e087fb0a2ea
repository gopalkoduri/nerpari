VSVKVoice manipulation skills alone do not constitute good music.  Depth holds the key. The present day music pattern is getting clearly defined  -   soft voice, softer interpretation.Classical songs in major ragas play a vital role in the success of a concert.  A good concert should leave the listener with the impressions of the singer's interpretation.Vijayalakshmi Subramaniam, in her inaugural concert in the winter music festival of Nadopasana, brought to bear on her performing technique a pleasant voice.It was an elegant style of presentation, but still there was something missing to make it impressive. Partly the selection for the first session of ragas and songs was responsible.Though "Siva Siva Enaradha" (Pantuvarali) and "Nee Dayaradha" (Vasantabhairavi) raised hopes of a good fare, the Kalyanavasantam (Nada Loludai), Vasanta (Sri Kamakshi) Yadukulakhambodi (Lalite Mam Pahi  -   a Chengalvaraya Sastri composition) pulled down the tempo of the concert.  The alapanas of Vasanta and Yadukulakhambhodi were more perceptive with traditional pidis at the hands of the violinist Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi.A. S. Ranganathan (mridangam) and K. V. Gopalakrishnan (ghatam) lent good percussive support.PotentialHow good kirtanas come to the help of a musician could be noticed in the recital of the junior artiste, Gayatri Devi. ``Rama Nannu Brovara" (Hari Khambodi) "Enta Ninne" (Mukhari) "Etavunara" (Kalyani) lifted her programme.The alapanas of Mukhari and Kalyani revealed potential. Ananta Padmanabhan (violin) looked more strident in his bowing while presenting his solo versions of the ragas. Manikantan (mridangam) gave enough indications of laya expertise both during accompanying the songs and in his brief tani.Bottom Template Starts
