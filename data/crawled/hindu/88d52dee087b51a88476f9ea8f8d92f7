VYoung and seasoned vocalist H.S. Nagaraj from Shimoga rose to the occasion by combining an impressive array of musical devices with his remarkable skill. His vocal recital accompanied enterprisingly by B. Raghuram (violin), C. Cheluvaraju (mridanga) \u000aand Sukanya Ramgopal (ghata) was held in connection with the 10th anniversary celebration and music conference under the aegis of Aradhana at the Shastri auditorium in Mahalakshmi layout. He made his expositions as forceful as possible without making it detrimental to the aesthetics of Carnatic music. Nagaraj rendered the songs with a force authentic to the composition.   The  vocalist began with the demanding Shahana varna. His manodharma was evident throughout the concert. The selection and presentation of &#8220;Pancha Matangamukha Ganapathe&#8221; (Malahari) with swaras and Vachaspathi for &#8220;Sahasra kara mandithe&#8221; (with chittai swaras) spoke of his musical capabilities.Raga Vasantha glittered in its detailed exposition of the krithi &#8220;Bhihadaambikayai&#8221; with sahitya and swaravinyasas. The raga Devagandhari meandered at a leisurely pace in the singing of Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Vinarada naa manavi&#8221;. Nagaraj&#8217;s seasoned artistry glowed forth in the expansion of raga Jyothiswaroopini for a Walajapet Venkataramana Bhagavatar&#8217;s krithi &#8220;Anandamaya&#8221;. The president of the music conference Padma Gurudutt was conferred upon with the title of &#8220;Kalaradhana Sri&#8221;.The great saint-composers and the Trinity of Carnatic music Thyagaraja, Muthuswamy Dikshitar and Shyama Sastry were remembered at the Geervana Bhavana, Banashankari, at the celebration of Vaggeyakara Day under the auspices of the Mulakanadu Mahasabha led by Sathyanarayana and N.V. Ramachandran.A good number of leading and upcoming musicians led by veteran flute-maestro B. Shankara Rao, merited vocalist D.V. Nagarajan and vibrant violinist Basavanagudi G. Nataraj rendered a krithi each by the trinity and Haridasas. A short saxophone recital by Sridhar Sagar was followed by Goshti Gayana (group singing). Pillari Geethas  were presented in group. It was a sight to behold.M. SURYA PRASADBottom Template Starts
