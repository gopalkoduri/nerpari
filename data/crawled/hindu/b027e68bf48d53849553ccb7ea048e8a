VThe annual violin concert at the Mylapore Fine Arts Club on Janaury 1 has an unbroken tradition of 30 years &#8212; Lalgudi Jayaraman, GJR Krishnan and Viji have thrilled the packed auditorium for so long, that new year morning at MFAC has become a melodious tradition with the rasikas.The brother-sister duo has carried on the tradition, with the maestro now recovering from a stroke. This year&#8217;s concert was extremely special, with Lalgudi Jayaraman sitting in the stage wings, witnessing the whole concert. Tiruchi Sankaran added his deft percussion strokes, along with Ghatam Suresh, making it all the more special. Kosalam, Khambodi, an intelligent pallavi in three ragas &#8212; Mohanam, Sahana and Dhanyasi formed the main part of the concert.The lighter section brought the delectably played &#8216;Baro Krishnayya&#8217; and &#8216;Srinivasa&#8217; in Hamsanandi, followed by a surprise announcement by GJR &#8212; a new thillana composed by Lalgudi Jayaraman in the raga Hindola Vasantham, in praise of Kamalamba of the Tiruvarur temple, referred to as &#8216;Shive, Sangita Rasike&#8217; in the composition by the violin legend.Music lovers may recall a varnam set by Ramaswami Dikshitar, father of Muthuswami Dikshitar, in the same raga. Taken up on the request of an ardent admirer, this new offering was a challenge to the maestro, in the face of his indifferent health, indomitable in his reverence for Carnatic music. Yet another string to his bow, the thillana received thunderous applause from the much moved audience. A double treat followed, with the Behag tillana, in praise of Muruga, a deity close to Lalgudi&#8217;s heart. A fitting conclusion, to a very special morning, indeed!
