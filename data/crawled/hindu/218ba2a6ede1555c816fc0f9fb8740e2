VVenumadhav is rarely heard in Carnatic concert circles. He also sings for classical dances. He is a diploma holder in music and had the privilege of learning under the tutelage of  guru Vasa Padmanabharao. He is also the student of Haripriya of Hyder\u000aabad sisters.What impresses when one listens to his music is his pleasing and rich voice culture with good range and expression. And one feels he needs to sing in more concerts. Sujanaranjani, an active music sabha functioning from Sanathanagar Hanuman Devasthanam complex, invited him to give a concert on Sunday. He was accompanied by Kolanka Saikumar on violin and B. Janardan on mridangam.Venumadhav opened withSaveri varnamand did in two speeds.
