VTyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Gnanamosagaradha&#8217; never fails to move and it certainly did,  the way Lakshmi Rangarajan presented it. &#8216;Nannubrova Radha Amba&#8217; in Janaranjani by Syama Sastri followed.Taygaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Paramathmudu&#8217; in Vagadeswari  was good, but  the vocalist had to strain herself to reach the higher octaves. The lively &#8216;Bhogendra Shayinam&#8217; in Kunthalavarali was  appropriate and it brought liveliness to the concert. Her Thodi was exquisite and when V.L.Kumar presented it on his violin, it was equally beautiful. She sang &#8216;Sree Krishnam Bhaja Manasa Sathatham&#8217; by Muthuswami Dikshitar.The niraval for &#8216;Shanka Chakra Gadha&#8217; gave the expected satisfaction, but the charming chittaswara  she sang was unheard of before, and an unexpected treat. Her RTP was in Kiravani with the pallavi, &#8216;Sri Raghavendram Bhajeham, Krupakaram, Dayakaram&#8217; set to kanda triputa tala. The raga delineation and thanam,  equally shared by both the vocalist and the violinist, came as a treat for the audience as both are veterans in their chosen fields.She decorated the pallavi with kalpanaswaras in Ritigowla, Hamsanadham and Sahana. &#8216;En Thayum Enakkarul Thanthaiyum&#8217;  culminated in &#8216;Muruganin Marupeyar Azhagu&#8217; in Behag by Surajananda. She concluded her concert with Periyazhvar&#8217;s pasuram, &#8216;Vanna Madangal Soozh&#8217; as ragamalika in  Mohanam, Kanada, Hamsanandhi and Surutti.It appeared as if the concert was meant for the elite and the initiated. Some rasikas felt she could have taken at least a Tamil song for elaborate treatment. Manoj Siva on the mridangam and Udupi Srikanth on the ganjira gave an enjoyable percussive treat. Manoj Siva was obviously giving his best and enjoying himself. But Udupi Srikanth concealed all his excitement and his fingers expressed what his face did not. He accepted all the challenges of Siva and exhibited skill, speed and imagination.
