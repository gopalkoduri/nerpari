VPurists may balk and connoisseurs may grimace but the fact remains that the electronic keyboard has quietly edged its way into the Carnatic music milieu and seems set for a long innings.Over the years, it has gradually gained acceptance among organisers and rasikas to the extent that it is now featured as a solo instrument during the iconic December music festival.Mahathi's keyboard solo was a case in point. Dubbed a child prodigy, this young artist has the requisite grit and determination to establish herself on the kutcheri circuit before the prodigy tag loses its shine.Saavy approachHer recital for the Rama Navami series at the Asthika Samajam, Alwarpet, was characterised by clean lines and a performance-savvy approach. Scintillating kalpanaswaras took off from the Abhogi varnam &#8216;Evari Bodha.' A proliferation of kanakkus ruled the swarakalpana affixed to &#8216;Pahi Pahi Balaganapathy' (Mazhuvoor Chidambara Bharathy) in Hamsadhwani. Tyagaraja's Gowla ratna &#8216;Dudukugala' evoked reverence and reverie. The charm of Amritavarshini, replete with graceful overtones, shone through in a sprightly &#8216;Sudhamayi' (Harikesanallur Muthaiah Bhagavatar) and in the final impassioned round of kalpanaswara. The upbeat vibes of &#8216;Raghuvamsa Sudhaambudhi' (Kathanakuthuhalam, Patnam Subramania Iyer) offered fair contrast to the Hindolam that followed. The artist chose to present her alapana in a heart-warming version that spelt instant appeal. Weaving warp and weft into zigzag motifs, Mahathi achieved leisurely exploration of octaves and variegated hues with commendable restraint, yet fluid ease, without resorting to gimmicks.The concluding kalpanaswara sortie in Tyagaraja's &#8216;Samaja Vara Gamana' sped towards a grand finale with an effective korvai. Thanjavur Sankara Iyer's &#8216;Ranjani Mala,' a composition seldom aired, was presented with dexterity, stringing together Ranjani, Sriranjani, Megharanjani and Janaranjani. Sri Pakkala Jayaprakash (violin) was in sync with Mahathi's ideas. Thillaisthanam Suryanarayanan (mridangam) pepped up proceedings by wrapping up compositions with a flourish and Gurubharadwaj (ganjira) followed suit.
