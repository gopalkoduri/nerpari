VClassicism of a high order characterised the inaugural concert of Vijay Siva at the September 2007 music festival under the aegis of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts. A prime disciple of D.K.Jayaraman, the disciplined artiste&#8217;s patanthara suddham and vidw\u000aat backed by tonal depth gave the concert a solid base without frills or gimmicks. &#8216;Jagadaanandakaraka&#8217; in Naattai with the chittaswaras provided a promising start. &#8216;Deva Deva Kalayamahe&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla) with niraval and swaras heightened his musical perception. His pleasant alapana of Anandabhairavi was highly imaginative and full of depth for the kriti, &#8216;O! Jagadamba.&#8217;&#8216;Chetasree Balakrishnam&#8217; in Dwijavanti was a in a tone of entreaty and compassion. His methodical progress in the Thodi alapana for the song, &#8216;Daasukovalane&#8217; with frequent use of akaara lent substance and lucidity to passages in the higher octaves. The RTP exercise in Khamas dwelt upon the inherent raga bhava with precise essays of thanam for the pallavi, &#8216;Narada Guruswami.&#8217;Varadarajan breathed charm into his raga development with sancharas equalising the vocalist that shone with brilliance. His mastery of bowing was evident in the solo versions of Anandabhairavi, Thodi and Khamas. Easwaran&#8217;s accompaniment on the mridangam for percussive support was an apogee of rhythm.In the junior slot held in the afternoon,  Ashwin Krishnamurthy and Anujan Krishnamurthy (Bombay Brothers) gave an impressive vocal recital as part of the sabha&#8217;s scheme to encourage budding talents in Carnatic music.The siblings with a penchant for virtuosity impressed the listeners with the oscillations of their voice in alapanas and sangatis. Their taste for neatness and clarity of diction came in for praise in &#8216;Neeve Nannu&#8217; (Ranjani), &#8216;Vandanamu&#8217; in Sahana and &#8216;Subrahmanyena Rakshithoham&#8217; (Suddhadhanyasi).The niraval and swaras following the latter drew wide acclaim.There was  grace in Sandhya&#8217;s violin accompaniment and her solo versions of the ragas merited plaudits. Babu on the mridangam filled the bill ably.The second day&#8217;s recital was marked by Bombay Jayashree&#8217;s perfect sruti alignment, judicious choice of compositions and evocative exposition of raga bhava in the alapanas.She wove  an inspiring magic casement around the madhyama and tara sthayis, harnessing her fabulous musical sentiments.Her thematic Saagara Sayanam concert eulogising Lord Mahavishnu had a sedate start with the item, &#8216;Vande Vaasudevam&#8217; in Sree ragam without the usual verve. But it gained tempo as the ragas she had chosen unfolded in resplendent hues in the subsequent numbers.&#8216;Sri Ranganathayasree&#8217; in Dhanyasi was a sober version. Her raga delineation of Hamirkalyani for the kriti, &#8216;Parimala Ranganatham Bhajeham&#8217; raised her musical consciousness to dignified heights.If the raga alapana of Saveri for the song, &#8216;Chalu Chalu&#8217; came with depth, the niraval and pleasing swaras had attractive patterns.Thepiece-de-resistanceof the kutcheri, the Charukesi raga vinyasam, khanda triputa for the RTP had a mesmerising purport and the raga sancharas in Vasanti, Nalinakanti and Sunadhavinodhini were alluring.The kirtanas included &#8216;Ksheerasagarasayana&#8217; (Devagandhari), &#8216;Sagara Sayana Vibho&#8217; (Baghesri) and Ksheera Sagara Taranga&#8217; (Sindhubhairavi). A vibrant tillana in Brindavana Saranga closed her agenda.Embar Kannan played sweet notes on the violin, bringing out the felicitous flavour of Charukesi, Saveri and Khamas. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) paired brilliantly with Sridhar (ghatam) in the percussion wing and their performance included a thani.The vocal recital of Unnikrishnan on the third day began with &#8216;Viribhoni&#8217; Ata tala varnam, and the artiste followed it up with &#8216;Guruvayurappa&#8217; (Chakravaaham) and &#8216;Sogasujuta Tharama&#8217; (Kannadagowlai) with swaras setting the mood for him and the rasikas.His Chandrajothi alapana had an extensive sweep and the prayogas were softened by jarus with no sagging of the fluidity of his vocal movements for the composition, &#8216;Baagaayanayya.&#8217;After a brisk presentation of &#8216;Sabesan Sevadi&#8217; in Saveri, the majestic gait of Khambodi  alapana offering scope for numerous shades and colour followed by niraval and swaras showcased his vidwat and exquisite manodharma for the kriti, &#8216;Thiruvadi Charanam.&#8217; Akkarai Subbulakshmi translated every note of the vocalist with more sheen and glow on the violin. She showed maturity in her bowing in delineating Charukesi and Kapi competently.Percussive support by Arun Prakash (mridangam) and Karthick (ghatam) was energetic.
