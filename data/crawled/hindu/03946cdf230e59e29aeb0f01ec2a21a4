VIt was another day of a signature scintillating concert for U. Shrinivas at the Gayana Samaja recently for Sri Rama Lalitha Kala Mandira's Founders Day celebration. In his typical calm and easy going attitude he was cheerfully striding along with accompanists on stage. The solidarity and participation that he fetches is infectious and the dais &#8212; with C.N. Chandrashekhar (violin), Bangalore V. Praveen (mridanga), Giridhar Udupa (ghata) and Sripada Rao (tanpura) &#8212; was an energetic flow of some two-and-a-half-hours of wholesome melody.Shrinivas had wonderful packaging &#8212; soft-flowing kritis, fast-paced movements, succinct raga-chaya preceeding kritis, long swara-prasthara, a moving and elaborate Shuba Pantuvarali for an RTP and of course all the tail-end tukdas that included the audience swing and clap in unison for a bhajan. What gave the concert a Shrinivas-stamp was his masterly manoeuvre of his instrument, his often perceptible pauses leading to some enjoyable rendering. He is able to talk to his mandolin and bring about wide-ranging sangatis, Papanasam Sivan's &#8220;Mooladhara&#8221; in Hamsadhwani for example, offered an assortment distinctly rich to the raga and the powerful lyrics. &#8220;I have researched the instrument and have been able to use the &#8216;plucks and glides' that the melody-mechanism throws about in a more sophisticated manner now,&#8221; Shrinivas told this reporter. &#8220;The instrument can be flexibly used to showcase the lyrical beauty where each pronunciation gets the required punch and stroke, while my touches on the bass strings are to get the maximum benefits of the instrument's character.&#8221;Shrinivas also tried to bring in the spirit and temperament of the instrument with the slow-paced &#8220;Ganamurthe&#8221; of Tyagaraja in the same raga that gives ample scope to accompanists too to make use of the in-between inherent stopovers that the kriti provides. If Shrinivas was happy seeing Chandrashekhar follow his versions like a shadow, Praveen and Udupa were making use of the intermittent quieter spaces with resonanting laya patterns.Shrinivas' concert gave Praveen and Udupa more room for manodharma as the master slipped into a tana in the Shubhapantuvarali raga-tana-pallavi. His enthusiasm slipped into a different gear when he asked for pakkavadhya to follow for the tana in aditala. Rhythmic verses wonderfully packed with laya followed and the entire samvada slipped into a ragamalika after the pallavi, throwing up deeper dimensions. After yet another evenly paced &#8220;Ksheerasagara&#8221; of Tyagaraja's in Devagandhari, the gripping numbers were Purandaradasa'a &#8220;Rama Rama&#8221; in Vasantha and Tyagaraja's &#8220;Sreepathe&#8221; in Nagaswarali providing more robust aural treats. The audience wouldn't move till they had their share of the routine hummers, &#8220;Nanati Baduku&#8221; in Revathi, &#8220;Kaliyuga Varadan&#8221; in Brindavani and &#8220;Krishna Nee Begane Baro&#8221; and the bhajan in Darbari Kaanada, from the master.
