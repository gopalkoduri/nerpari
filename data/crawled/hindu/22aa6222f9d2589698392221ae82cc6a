VIt is no mean task for accompanying violinists to hold a concert together as the main artists, and keep the audience's interest alive through raga treatise, kriti, niraval or swarakalpana. That's what they did at Shanmukhapriya's Madhuradwani Isai Vizha held recently at Swamy's Hall.The young violinist B.U. Ganesh Prasad played a significant solo. His tutelage under violin maestro V.V. Subramaniam gave him the wisdom of including strength and delicacy to his offerings. The sensitive strokes of Shanmukhapriya showed the artist's grasp of Carnatic nuances with clarity. &#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam' with several swara cycles set the tone for the concert.Ganesh Prasad elaborated Saraswathi (&#8216;Saraswathi Namosthuthe'), Begada (&#8216;Nadopasana') and the main Karaharapriya (&#8216;Pakkala Nilabadi'). Prasad's raga essays were careful but during the swarakalpana, he became an adventurer. His swaras in Saraswathi as well as Kharaharapriya after the niraval on &#8216;Manusuna' were built with intricacy and vision. For fast tracks, he chose &#8216;Ninnu Joochi' in Sowrashtram, &#8216;Anupama Gunambuthi' in Atana and &#8216;Seethamma Maayamma' in Vasantha in between.B. Ganapathyraman extended robust support on the mridangam with Anirudh Athreya on the ganjira who neutralised it with subtlety.Detailed essaysHis long experience in music was reflective in the solo concert of M.A. Sundareswaran. Every kriti he played had the stamp of the school he belongs to and the inseparable swirls, swings and staccato phrases, touch of high notes with least effort were integrated in an unobtrusive way in Sundareswaran's bowing and fingering.A varnam in Desiya Thodi was a surprising start of his concert. He included some unusual kritis in his repertoire. He presented a detailed essay of Brindavansaranga for Dikshitar's &#8216;Soundrarajam' and Syama Sastri's Paras kriti &#8216;Neelayadakshi' both in praise of the presiding deities of Nagapattinam. He played a sketch of the fifth mela, Manavati, a raga with vivadhi swaras and the Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Evarito.'These apart, there were &#8216;Pranamamyaham' in Gowla with swara streams, a sedate Devagandhari number &#8216;Enneramum Un' and fairly elaborate Kalyani with &#8216;Nidhi Chala' with niraval-swara package on &#8216;Mamata Bandana', and the regal Kharaharapriya kriti &#8216;Chakkani Raja' with swaras on &#8216;Kantiki Sundara.'Sundareswaran shared fine camaraderie with his rhythmic partners K.V. Prasad and Vaikkom Gopalakrishnan on the mridangam and the ghatam, respectively.Prasad and Gopalakrishnan's percussion patterns were in complete sync with the main artist without overshadowing him.
