VPerforming at the YACM anniversary series, vocalist K. Bharat Sundar, a disciple of Leelavathi Gopalakrishnan, displayed a remarkable degree of assurance and confidence, the kind that comes from investing much time and effort in one&#8217;s music.The young enthusiastic team of accompanists consisting of Parur M.S. Ananthakrishnan (violin), Delhi Sairam (mridangam) and H. Prasanna (ghatam) was put through its paces in Pachimiriam Adiappa&#8217;s Bhairavi ata tala varnam &#8216;Viriboni&#8217; followed by Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s&#8216;Vatapi Ganapathim&#8217; (Hamsadhwani), both pieces were sung and played with enjoyment and gusto.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Gurulekha&#8217; (Gowrimanohari) had concise swaras with effective poruthams. While ease and familiarity were evident in the Varali alapana, the rapid-fire delivery of prayogas hurried through content instead of savouring it.The violinist, also caught up in the same restless energy, came up with his own take which was not in sync with the vocalist&#8217;s ideas.There was ample fluidity and fluency in the neraval at the line &#8216;Aravinda&#8217; in Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Seshachalanayakam&#8217;.A notable aspect of the vocalist&#8217;s presentation was his predilection for a focal idea in the neraval and kalpanaswara segments, which he proceeded to develop in logical sequence.These provided specific points of interest in the kuraippu in the kalpanaswaras in Varali and the swaraprasthara at &#8216;Thamasamu&#8217; in Subbaraya Shastri&#8217;s &#8216;Janani Ninnuvina&#8217; (Ritigowla).A racy &#8216;Bhogindra Saayinam&#8217; (Kunthalavarali) added pep before the main raga Saveri, which was structured with poise and capped with a spate of nagaswaram-style passages in the tara sthayi. The kriti was Shama Shastri&#8217;s elegant &#8216;Durusuga&#8217;.Although Bharat Sundar&#8217;s singing reflects the conscious assimilation of concepts derived from an easily recognisable contemporary vocal style, the fact that he has opted for emulation rather than imitation works in his favour. There is plenty of scope for this young singer to forge his own seal on his essays.However, one area to which he must pay attention is voice quality and projection.The vocalist must work on building strength and resonance of voice and must explore open-throated singing, particularly in the upper octave where the voice tends to sound thin and laboured.The violinist M.S. Ananthakrishnan rendered an expansive Saveri alapana.The percussionists Delhi Sairam and H. Prasanna, enthused the main artist with their vigorous support. The percussion tended to be too loud at certain points, drowning out the vocalist&#8217;s softer nuances.
