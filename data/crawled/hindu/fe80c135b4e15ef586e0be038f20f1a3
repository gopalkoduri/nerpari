VS. P.Dr. V. V. Srivatsa, eminent musicologist, presented an outstanding lecture demonstration on the nine bhakti rasas &#151;  shravanam, keertanam, smaranam, padasevanam, archanam, vandanam, dasyam, sakhyam and atmanivedanam &#151; embedded in the nine (nava vidha bhakti) kritis of Maharaja Swati Tirunal. Srivatsa's passion for musicology is constantly fuelled by an unquenchable thirst for perfection. His speech punctuated with erudition, music and humour, kept the discerning audience in thrall for more than two and a half hours.It is not for nothing that Srivatsa is known as a polyglot, his fluency in several Indian languages came to the fore when he chose apt quotations from the sayings of the Azhwars, references from the compositions of the Haridasas, Tyagaraja, Dikshitar, Bhadrachala Ramadas and other saint poets. Referring to Swati Tirunal as a Dharmishta, Srivatsa said that the king followed closely the royal path laid by Purandaradasa, Tyagaraja, Dikshitar and others.  Srivatsa sang the nine songs in Bhairavi, Kedaragowla, Nilambari, Todi, Bilahari, Begada, Ahiri, Mukhari and Nadanamakriya to the accompaniment of M.A. Krishnaswami on the violin, and K. R. Ganesh on the mridangam. Mohan Santhanam provided vocal support. The event was organised byNaadhabrahmamin celebration of its third anniversary on June 3.Bottom Template Starts
