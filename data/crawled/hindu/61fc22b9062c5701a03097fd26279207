VAmir Khusro Sangeet Academy in association with Bharat Kalachar presented Shantanu Bhattacharya, recipient of the President&#8217;s gold medal in Khayal and Thumri, in  two scintillating performances.  One was a lecture-demonstration at A.R. Rahman&#\u000a8217;s school of Music and Music Technology and a Hindustani classical concert at the Bharat Kalachar. Accompanied by his wife Durba, also a product of the ITC Research Academy, and daughter Mitra, who is being trained in the nuances of the Patiala Gharana, the trio excelled themselves setting high standards in classical rendition&#8220;In the North Indian classical music, ragas are Time bound. Like the monsoon ragas there are seasonal ragas like Hori and Basant.&#8217; The ragas are steeped in &#8216;bhava&#8217; or mood. At a documentary function hosted by the Russian Film Corporation in 1950, Pt. Ravi Shankar exclaimed, &#8220;Raga is neither a scale, nor a mood. It is both of them and more.&#8221;This is one of the key features that determines a raga; since raga has a psychic form, an occult body, it wishes to express itself and this emerges as we go deeper into it. Apart from the scale, this peep into the inner being of the raga is what the Guru teaches the Sishya. To demonstrate the raga bhava, it is important to look at the ragas from dawn to dusk.The morning ragas are steeped in moral tradition and spirituality, the evening ragas in philosophic and reflective thought. Bhimplas, Multani and Madhuwanti belong to this category. Dhrupad was the original form of expression.Under the Persian influence, the raga developed on broader dimensions, the Khayal developed on the concept of imaginary poetry through lyrics with maend, with taal in cyclic system, in gat bandish to make presentation disciplined. In a raga delineation with endless flow of improvisations, the &#8216;sam&#8217; never extends beyond &#8220;pa.&#8221;Raga Bairagi was taken from among the morning ragas, &#8220;Mere man mein baso ram&#8221; and the students were asked to count and tell the matra on which the bandish began. The same bandish was sung in Miyan ki malhar in ektaal and Multani in zhaptal. This was quite a feat of craftsmanship while the swaras floated covering different shrutis.Shantanu pointed out that through &#8216;Sur sadhna&#8217; the Guru should facilitate the visualisation of the swaras and the tala and once the visualisation process sets in there is no looking back.This visual aspect during the learning process is most important, he said. Swaras, devoid of laya, are nothing. The relative position of every swara with the other swara should be determined. Raga Yaman Kalyan in ektal showcased how a raga develops as a living being &#8211; and the musical phrases are a conversation which connect us to our great tradition.Six-year old Mitra sang a bandish in Khamaj laced with alaps and tans with such  throw  showing that the right taalim and instruction allow one to concentrate on cyclic images and patterns of beat. This was a composition of Pt. Gyan Prakash. She followed this with a taranna, &#8216;tana tana tom tadaare dani.&#8217;Shantanu demonstrated what differentiated Bilawal from Alahaya Bilawal and Khamaj. Durba took Bihag in her crystal clear cultured voice &#8216;Raen Mori &#8216;and brought out the difference between Yaman and Bihag executing different taan patterns, followed by an old traditional taranaa of Ustad Bahadur Singh Khan Sahib of 1850s. The trio concluded with a bhajan in Desmalhar, &#8220;Tere bina manmandir mera hai bada sunsan, tum aa jana bhagwan.&#8221; Rajesh Dhawale from the KMMC provided support on the tabla.Shantanu began in his deep resonant voice raga Shud kalyan in vilambit Ektaal, &#8220;Aaj ke ghar servo ho&#8221; followed by a madhya laya piece, &#8220;Ne karo gunan sukhe sunpuda para&#8221; and a piece in dhrut teen tal &#8220;Bandho re bandho mandarwa,&#8221; scaling the three octaves bearing the unmistakable stamp of his gurus the inimitable Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Sahib and Pt. Ajoy Chakravarti and of Pt. Bhim sen Joshi as pointed out by Dr. Mrs YGP in the true gharana tradition.Durba took Raga Ragashree in madhya laya teen taal, &#8220;Beguno ke gunvanto data&#8221; and in dhrut &#8220;Raag sang ragni mil mangala gaye,&#8221; a composition of Pt. Gyan prakash Ghosh.&#8220;Tune bisaru kynu jiue Hari, Tumhe bisaro ne jiyo,&#8221; a bhajan in Bhageshwari written by Indira Devi and tuned by Shantanu was sung. Mitra sang &#8216;Lagale guru charnan sang preet,&#8217; a bhajan in Kirwani, lyrics of Mira Bai, tuned by Durba.The  highlight of the evening was &#8216;Baat chalat nayee chunri rang daari re,&#8217; a bandish in Bhairavi, sung by all the three together, followed by a popular bandish of the Patiala gharana in dhrut, &#8216;Shyam sundar madan mohan jago mere lala.&#8217;The Tabalya Sree Debasish Dass, a product of Visva-Bharati Shantiniketan synchronised beautifully and played brilliantly. The Academy&#8217;s  Young Artist Award was presented to him by dancer Vyjayanthimala Bali.
