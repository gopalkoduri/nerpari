VHe presented a varied fare, a combination of heavy and light ragas, with  ease and beauty. Being a mridangist, he rendered his swaras with mathematical precision arousing interest in the audience for more. The graham beda in the main piece in  Madhyamavathi, &#8216;Palimsu Kamakshi&#8217;, was rendered with the effortlessness  and alacrity of a mature artist.The Dikshitar kriti in Mayamalavagowla was also very striking.The famous poem of Subramania Bharati&#8217;s &#8216;Kakai Siraginilae Nandalala&#8217;, in the raga Chandrakauns was mellifluous. His tillana in Desh, a composition of Lalgudi Jayaraman, had the rasikas in raptures. It was a fulfilling evening for the audience as there were compositions by different  composers.An up-and-coming artist, who is proficient in mridangam, keyboard and vocal, Ravi Shankar definitely has the capacity to entertain music lovers and keep them enthralled.He was ably accompanied by Kopu Nagarajan on the mridangam and T.H. Vasantha on the violin.Both accompanying artists played very supportively and it was a remarkable team job.
