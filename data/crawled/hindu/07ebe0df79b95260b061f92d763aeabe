VA talented artist hailing from the Lalgudi school of music, Jayanthi Radhakrishnan's (now Jayanthi Kumaresh) dedicated approach and hard work coupled with her manodharma have rightly earned her a slot amongst the top veena players of the day.Obeisance to Lord Ganesha with Koteeswara Iyer's &#8216;Varanamukha' (Hamsadhwani) is paid at the beginning of this compact disc and sets the right pace for the fare which follows.Delightful vinyasaThe vinyasa of Bahudari is totally delightful with the artist's manodharma in full flow. There is no half-hearted pulling of the strings and Jayanthi makes sure that the tara sthayi gandhara note is struck with precision when pulled from the shadjam. Tyagaraja's &#8216;Brovabharama,' a favourite piece of the Lalgudi school, is a delicate rendering with brilliant swaraprastharas.The Bhairavi swarajathi of Syama Sastri's &#8216;Kamakshi' is played with a good grip. The swara-sahitya passages are however played only once, probably since the swara and sahitya meetus are the same. The overall effect would have been enhanced if played twice.&#8216;Sankaram Abhirami Manoharam' (Kamalamanohari ) of Muthuswami Dikshitar, on Lord Siva, enshrined at the Thirukadaiyur temple, is a samashti charanam composition, played with the right raga bhava. The chittaswaram adds enjoyment to the kriti.Jayanthi's essay of Kalyani followed by Tyagaraja's &#8216;Ammaravamma' are reflective of her control over the instrument. The patanthara of the kriti sports additional sangathis not frequently heard. The fiery swara passages culminate in a very mathematical korvai.&#8216;Chandrasekara' (Sindhubhairavi-Papanasam Sivan), &#8216;Kannan Varugindra Neram' (Oothukadu Venkata Subba Iyer) and a Thiruppugazh tuned in Dwijavanti serve as excellent desserts and bring the album to a good finish.The percussive accompaniment by Tiruvarur Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and Vaikom Gopalakrishnan (ghatam) is professional and sensitive.
