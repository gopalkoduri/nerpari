VThe second day of the six-day VMDA festival had New Delhi-based Meeta Pandit rendering Hindustani vocal. Her presentation of  the Gwalior Gharana, which she had imbibed from her grandfather and father  was divine.  She made it a fruitful effort explicating and expatiating the attributes of divinity in music in general and the sangeetha sahitya bhavas in particular. She got off to an elated start with aBada Khayalin vilambhit tempo followed by aChota Khayalin doubled up tempo in teental in Surdasi Malhar.  After singing Taranas set to Jap and Teentals in Tilak Kamodh, she rendered a Tappa with a scintillating effect surfacing the typical Panjabi traditional gana fervour in Raag Kapi, a Meera Bhajan, a seasonal folk in Kajri , a Tumri in a tune based on Khamaj and concluded with another seasonal folk.She was accompanied on harmonium by Vyasmurty Katti and on tabla by Viswanadh Nakod both from Bangalore. While managing trustee of the academy G.R.K. Prasad alias Rambabu introduced the artistes. The chairman of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, P.K. Bishnoi presented mementos to them.The next evening witnessed a carnatic vocal by Gayatri Venkata Raghavan in the company of Padma Sankar on violin and Neveli Narayanan on mridangam, all from Chennai. All through the concert, the expression of manodharma was marked for its coherently fortifying effect on the emotional content embedded in the compositions she chose to sing.Elaboration ofNaradamunivedale(Pantuvarali),Abhimanamennadukalugunoof Patnam Subramany Iyer (Begada) andSariyevvarammaof Shyama Sastri which went reminiscent of the aesthetic tradition of exposition of her guru late A. Sundaresan, were the highlights.
