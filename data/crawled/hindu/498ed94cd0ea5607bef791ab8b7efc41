VT. V. Sankaranarayanan sings from the heart, and the music speaks to the soul. The veteran vocalist was at his very best for a concert organised by Manirang to commemorate the late Carnatic vocalist Neyyatinkara Vasudevan.The sloka &#8216;Gajananam' in Mohanam came from the heart, and it was tagged to &#8216;Gajananamam Palaya Pavana,' which gave listeners a hint of the musical feast that was to come later.The concluding &#8216;Gopala' of the second kriti in Nayaki lingered in the air for a while before the singer took up Sudhadhanyasi raga for the kriti &#8216;Sri Parthasarathy.' Violinist Sampath displayed a distinctive style during the raga and swara rendition. The kriti &#8216;Vasudevayani' in Kalyani elevated the spirits of the audience, during an impeccable niraval that was adorned with opulent sangatis and sleek swara structures.&#8216;Guruvayoorappa' in Chakravakam was full of feel and &#8216;Smarajanaka' in Behag raga was decorated with swara beadings.Subtle touchesKapi, chosen as the main raga for the day, was detailed with a lot of manodharma, showcasing the singer's erudition. Subtle touches of the raga caressed each and every listener; the audience were transported to another world by the singer's musical flourishes.The unconventional beginning of &#8216;Entha Soukhya,' which was begun with the charanam, was spontaneous and it went on to a delightful delivery of instantly improvised swarams of various lengths. It was followed by a a crisp and compact taniavartanam by Nanjil Arul on the mridangam and Tripunithara Radhakrishnan on the ghatam. &#8216;Kanna Karmukil Varna,' a slokam in Hamsanandi, was soft and soothing.The next two ragas &#8211; Manirang and Sindhu Bhairavi &#8211; were both favourites of Neyyatinkara Vasudevan. A soulful slokam in Manirang was an apt choice and so was the concluding &#8216;Venkitachala Hridayam' that tugged at the hearts of the rasikas. The concert was organised under the auspices of the Neyyatinkara Vasudevan Foundation, &#8216;Manirang.'
