VBhramara Trust of Y.T and Madhuri Thathachari bestowed Professor G.T. Narayana Rao Award on young flautist V. Vamshidhar at Shri Krishna Gana Sabha in Mysore recently. It was in memory of the noted science writer and art critic Professor GTN, who in the field of art always showed a fond preference for the potential of younger generations.On this occasion, graced by the pontiff of Suttur Mutt, Shri Shivarathri Deshikendra Swamiji, the Trust recognised C.V. Nagaraj, retired senior chemist (Government of India) by conferring on him the prestigious Bhramara Award for Lifetime Services to Society.The evening featured a katcheri by the awardee, Vamshidhar. Shankarabharana (&#8220;Pogadirelo Ranga&#8221;-Purandaradasa) and Thodi (&#8220;Shri Krishnam Bhaja&#8221;-Dikshithar) happening to be his choice for detailed renderings, it was the audience's privilege for having been introduced to the subtle nuances of these numbers.Whereas Shankarabharana developed in incremental progressions in a dignified pace, Thodi evolved gently, radiating soothing wafts. Observe the movements in the mandra sthayi while expatiating Thodi. The graces were gentle and deep, and the progressions smooth and delicate. The sahithya section and that of the neraval and swaraprastara having been instilled and enriched with the same mood that he created while portraying the respective raga, the listeners could enjoy uniformity in flow of experience, so that a meditative ambience prevailed undisturbed and unmitigated throughout any given presentation.Melody accompanist M.A. Sundareshwaran (violin) with his keen sense of perception, instantly recognising the lead artiste's gentle predisposition for tradition and delicacy, admirably abstained himself from any redundant technical manoeuvrings, and made his style fully compatible with that of the flautist &#8212; thus, gentle violin curves emanated in tune with tonal qualities emerging from the flute.H.S. Sudhindra (mridanga - exceptional control over his crisp beats) and B. Shashishankar (ghata - harmonising with the styles of both melody and rhythm quarters) constituted the rhythm ensemble.Considering the supplicating tone that runs deeply in Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer's &#8220;Aparadhamulanniyu&#8221; (Lathangi), relatively an overall slower pace seemed preferable and apt. Here, even the framing of kalpanaswaras warranted a better approach in this light.The concert also comprised &#8220;Mundhuvenaka&#8221; (Durbar-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Chinnanade&#8221; (Kalanidhi - Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Krishna Ni Begane&#8221; (Yamunakalyani - Vyasarayaru).
