VB. Vijayagopal is a talented flautist, who is able to articulate musical sense with intelligence. In his concert, what stood out were the strong laya base and an orientation to keep things simple. There were bright spots in the main song, &#8216;Ethavunara' (Kalyani, Tyagaraja) and &#8216;Muruga Muruga' (Saveri, Thooran).Opening briskly with the Hamsadhwani kriti, &#8216;Mooladhara Murthy' and the flute favourite, &#8216;Manavyalakinchara' (Nalinakanti), the concert, however, slipped into ordinariness during the Sarasangi alapana (&#8216;Neekela Dayaradu,' Mahavaidyanatha Sivan). The choice of Sarasangi after Nalinakanti is a moot question, with the congruence of most of the notes except the daivatam and the vakra-arohana structure of Nalinakanti, and Vijay struggled to portray Sarasangi's distinctiveness. The Kalyani alapana was attractive and the highlight of the concert. Vijayagopal's artistic use of the alto type flute in the lower octave conveyed his sensitivity. Niraval at &#8216;Sri Garudagu Thyagarajarchita' had classic phrases. V.V. Srinivasa Rao responded well on the violin. Skandasubramaniam (mridangam) sustained the sensitive mood. He and Guruprasad (ghatam) played a thani with interesting korvais. Smoother sound production and dynamic intonation on his instrument would lend better justice to Vijayagopal's musical ideas.
