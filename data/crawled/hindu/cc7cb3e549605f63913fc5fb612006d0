VYoung vocalist Amrutha Venkatesh presented a concert under the auspices of Hamsadhwani Creations at the Ananya Sabhangana on Saturday, accompanied by Charulatha Ramanujam (violin), Anoor Ananthakrishna Sharma (mridanga) and G. Guruprasanna (khanjari)\u000a.The recital was devoted exclusively to Sanskrit compositions on the Goddess Lakshmi, and an impressive start was made with &#8220;Kamalambike&#8221; in Nattai, a composition of Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar set to khandajathi jhampa tala. The krithi, incorporating interwoven swara and sahitya passages, and the ensuing brief kalpana swaras were rendered in a measured pace anchored in tradition, that set the tone for the evening. &#8220;Kalasha Vardhijam&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in Ratnangi set to aditala, a short alapana of Sree Raga, and the Dikshithar krithi &#8220;Sree Varalakshmi&#8221; followed.Kalyani was next taken up for a melodious alapana that was notable for the sancharas around the panchama, thara shadja and gandhara. &#8220;Mathim Dehi&#8221;, a composition of Vanamamalai Jeer in aditala, was embellished with a few avarthanas of kalpana swaras. &#8220;Sree Bhargavi&#8221; by Dikshithar in Mangalakaishiki, a janya of Mayamalavagoula, provided a striking contrast. The Swathi Thirunal composition &#8220;Sreekukamara Nagaralaye&#8221; in Athana and Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8220;Ma Padamboruham&#8221; in Kunthalavarali, both set to adi tala, led to the main raga of the evening, Todi.The elaboration of the raga was expansive, and the sancharas around the tara sthayi gandhara and madhyama in particular, displayed admirable voice control, modulation and depth. The myriad shades of the raga were showcased through a variety of phrases that bore testimony to considerable imaginative and improvisational powers. Mysore Vasudevacharya&#8217;s &#8220;Ksheerasagarathanaye&#8221; in adi tala, featured a contemplative neraval at &#8220;Dehi Me Mudam&#8221;, and kalpana swaras that ended with a stint around the panchama. The Swathi Thirunal krithi &#8220;Pahi Jagajjanani&#8221; in Hamsanandi and a shloka in Suruti provided a fitting finale to the concert, which was enriched by the whole-hearted support of an array of accomplished artistes providing melodic and percussive accompaniment.Endowed with a heavy voice tinged with huskiness, the vocalist negotiated heavy gamakas and fast brigas with equal ease. The emphasis was more on the raga bhava than on rhythmic complexities, and perfect sruthi alignment was one of the highlights of the performance.The concert comprised an eclectic mix of popular krithis and rare pieces, and a number of composers, ragas and talas. The sedate pace could, however, have been livened up with a couple of fast pieces without detriment to the thematic content of the concert. Also, more clarity and precision and greater emphasis on the khara, athikhara, mridu and ghosha aspects of the syllables, in the enunciation of the Sanskrit lyrics, which were replete with literary adornments, would have heightened the total impact in no uncertain measure.
