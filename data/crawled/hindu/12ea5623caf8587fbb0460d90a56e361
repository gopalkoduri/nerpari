VWhile Beatlemania has never really gone out of style, John Lennon's solo career has often been underrated. He had, by far, the most eclectic solo career among the four Beatles.His 1968 albumUnfinished Music, No. 1: Two Virginswas the beginning of the end for the Beatles. This experimental album recorded along with Yoko Ono was followed up byUnfinished Music, No. 2: Life with the Lions, the Wedding Albumand the immensely popular anti-war song, "Give Peace a Chance"."Cold Turkey", his next release with the Plastic Ono Band, about his battle with heroin addiction, failed to make the Top 10 in both the U.K. and the U.S.A. February 1970, two months before McCartney's announcement about the split of the Beatles, saw his next hit single "Instant Karma", followed byJohn Lennon/Plastic Ono Band,a raw album influenced by the primal therapy he had been undergoing.In 1971, he released another protest song "Power to the People" before moving to New York City. That fall saw the release of the album that still defines Lennon today,Imagine.Beginning withSometime in New York Cityin 1972, Lennon fell into a downward spiral before returning with another hitWalls and Bridgesin 1974. The success of this album is primarily credited to the song "Whatever Gets You Through The Night", which he co-wrote with Elton John. Lennon's appearance in the latter's concert that year was his last public performance.In 1975, Lennon releasedRock & Roll, a collection of oldies recorded during his famous "lost weekend". After this, Lennon disappeared from the music scene, resurfacing only in 1980 withDouble Fantasy, featuring the single "(Just Like) Starting Over". Even as the album and single were rising through the charts, Lennon was shot by Mark David Chapman, ending a career that has earned the love, respect and envy of millions around the world.RAKESH MEHARBottom Template Starts
