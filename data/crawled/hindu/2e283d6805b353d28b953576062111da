VSudheendra Bhoumik (Swarasankula Sangeetha Sabha) sang accompanied by Veerabhadrayya Hiremath (harmonium) and D.C. Venkatesh Iyer (tabla) in Mysore last week.The veteran of high repute presented the ragas in pristine purity in commensurate with the depth and dignity, keeping any ostentation at bay: the concert made lasting impressions at deeper levels of the intellect. One of the strong features in his approach was abundance of smooth glides over the octaves: the essences of the ragas now pleasantly striking the mind at once.Take for example Gouri (Bhairav Thaat) which  gave the evening a pleasant aura, indeed a traditional beginning. Observe how characteristically he rests on the mandra nishad, later to establish the relationship between pancham and rishab. Imaginatively he ascends to the nishad, once again to slide down to the lower ones giving an ineffable feel of Gouri.Such chalans explored both the mandra and taara saptak systematically, at times remarkably reaching the extremes of the lower octave. Invigorating nom-thoms transformed the overall mood into relishes of wonder and peace. Further, such inclusions simulated the effects characteristic of instrumental pattern of creating music (vaadya kaaku).After such a firm groundwork he sang &#8220;Ji Na Jayo Mathura&#8221;, embellishing the lyrics with sargams later adding taans. He spontaneously structured such embellishments providing ample allowances for their evolvement within aesthetic boundaries, so that the essence of the raga or import of the lyrics flourished undisturbed and undistorted.Fortified with all the above merits, another cheez, &#8220;Shyamasunder Nache&#8221; (Malkauns) thrived on short and long amplitude meends and similar scholarly beautifications.The melody accompanist enhanced the acceptability of the singer&#8217;s accomplishments, and his dexterity in evoking subtle graces so similar to the vocal style was amazing. The young percussionist too maintained the same grip over his instrument always complementing the main artiste&#8217;s visualisation and extempore.Two compositions in Hamir (&#8220;Karam Karthar&#8221; and &#8220;Kaise Ghar&#8221;) and &#8220;Dil Leke&#8221; (thumri - Mishra Tilak Kamod) were other absorbing numbers.*** Anagha and Megha of tender age presented a joint recital (Chiguru Sourabha) accompanied by Sangeetha (violin) and Eshwari (mridanga). Thyagaraja Sangeetha Sabha and Department of Kannada and Culture had jointly organised this programme to promote young artistes. Whatever may be the shortcomings, their singing simply mesmerised the audience by virtue of their innocence and commitment. Surprisingly, one could mark in their singing, clarity in lyrics better than what one could find in the concerts of seasoned artistes &#8211; the reason: here more of involved simplicity and less of pompous display.&#8220;Viriboni&#8221; (Atta tala-Bhairavi-Pachimiriam Adiappayya) lent warmth to Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Raghunayaka&#8221; (Hamsadhwani). They also framed a few strains of kalpanaswaras to the latter composition.Emotive diction characterised &#8220;Nammi Vachina&#8221; (Kalyani &#8211; Thyagaraja) which expected a tone of submission, which the artiste successfully conveyed.  The alapana that preceded also favoured the mood. Neraval at &#8220;Nadarupa&#8221; and kalpanaswaras complemented the composition.Other highlights were &#8220;Entha Dhanyalo&#8221; (Todi - Purandaradasa) and &#8220;Shri Ramana Vibho&#8221; (Arabhi - Swathi Thirunal)
