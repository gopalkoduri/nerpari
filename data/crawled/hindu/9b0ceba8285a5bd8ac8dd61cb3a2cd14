VWhether this was her own &#8216;wish list&#8217; or that of the organiser or a combination of both, one does not know. But the path with this wish list is a less travelled one. A full-fledged concert comprising compositions of Annamacharya, Badrachal\u000aa Ramadas, Patnam Subramanya Iyer and N.Ch. Krishnamacharyulu (all non-Trinity compositions), by this South India-based artiste was enthralling, the other day in the Capital. Pantula Rama who presented a vocal recital on the last day of Sree Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha&#8217;s recent music festival interwove her manodharma skills into the compositions of these composers and translated her recital of close to two-and-a-half hours into a memorable one.Pantula Rama began her recital very impressively with Patnam Subramanya Iyer&#8217;s popular varnam, &#8220;Era napai&#8221; in raga Todi, in two speeds. Presenting this varnam could have been a warming up piece. But it is often said that rigorous practice of varnams helps in gaining a thorough knowledge of ragas, swaras, talas and even attaining a controlled voice culture. This at the very outset, this opening piece was indicative of the depth of her musical skills encompassing the above.Krishnamacharyulu&#8217;s composition &#8220;Gajavadanamasraye&#8221; in raga Kedaram which  Rama presented subsequently contained lively kalpana swaras towards the end. Patnam Subramanya Iyer&#8217;s composition, &#8220;Rama Ikkanannu&#8221; in raga Sahana underwent fine treatment. She brought to the fore the essence of this raga while presenting a fine delineation of it. While presenting Annamacharya&#8217;s composition &#8220;Deva Devam bhaje&#8221; in raga Hindolam, she brought the emotive aspects of the raga to the fore.The vocalist took up the composition of Badrachala Ramadas, &#8220;Ennathanu Rama vadana&#8221; in the raga Pantuvarali,  for a somewhat detailed presentation, with improvisations in the form of a fine alap of the raga, niraval of the phrase &#8220;Rama Rama Rama ennusu ramanivokkane&#8221; and swaraprastaras rich in creativity. Same was the case with the main item of  Rama&#8217;s recital, which was &#8220;Sankalpame thrilo manasa&#8221;, a composition of Patnam Subramanya Iyer in the raga Kharaharapriya. Here, the delineation of the raga was excellent and she brought out the raga bhava  at various stages of her delineation. The niraval of a phrase from the charanam of the composition and the subsequent swaraprastaras flowed with rich creativity. However, she could have well avoided those touches of Hindustani music in the swaraprastaras of the Pantuvarali  presentation.Pantula Rama was ably assisted by M.S.N. Murthy on the violin, Neyveli Skandasubramanian on the mridangam and H. Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam. While Murthy&#8217;s delineation of the ragas Sahana, Pantuvarali and Kharaharapriya were delightful, the tani avartanam of Skandasubramanian and Sivaramakrishnan in Adi tala was captivating. In addition, their understanding percussion support, particularly when  the vocalist was presenting niraval and swaraprastaras, added value to the concert. On the whole, this concert was a fitting and memorable finale to the four-day music festival  &#8216;Entharo Mahanubhavulu&#8217;, held at the  Delhi Tamil Sangam.
