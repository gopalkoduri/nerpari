VMusic is above the divide of caste, creed and nationality. It integrates not only the musical notes but also human beings; hence it is perhaps the best means for national integration. With this view in mind, the Sumadhur Hansadhwani Trust, founded by Sumitra Guha, presented a two-day festival, &#8220;National Integration Through Music&#8221;, this past week at Stein auditorium, in New Delhi&#8217;s India Habitat Centre. The chief guest, Gursharan Kaur, wife of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who inaugurated the festival, said in her message: &#8220;It is amazing how the seven basic notes are fundamental to all forms of music and the base for all compositions from different regions in different languages.&#8221;The host artiste Sumitra Guha opened the festival with two lovely compositions of her own, in raga Jog. The slow tempo bada khayal &#8220;Shubh din aaj&#8221; with a leisurely gait and the chhota khayal &#8220;Sur nar muni&#8221; at a faster pace, were both set to vilambit and drut Ek tala respectively. She also sang a composition in raga Hamsadhwani, in haste, before concluding her recital with a Meera bhajan. Her being in a hurry was understandable because she had two guest artistes after her, but she could have sung just one raga at length instead of two in a hurry. Bharat Bhushan Goswami on the sarangi and Aniruddha Mukherjee on the tabla gave her commendable support.Shanno Khurana with her unique grooming under the choicest gurus of the Rampur, Gwalior and Agra gharanas like Ustad Mushtaq Hussain Khan, Musalgaonkar, Ratanjhankar and V.R. Athvale, and her vibrant voice with open abandon, stole the show. Opening her vocal recital with raga Chandrakauns, she presented two compositions in Ek tala exploring the raga in great detail. Next came the famous tappa &#8220;O miyaan jaanewale&#8221; in raga Kafi, a traditional composition of Shori Miyaan, the inventor of this intricate musical genre. Although it is a very challenging gayaki (style of singing), Shanno, with an exclusive album of just tappas to her credit, once again proved that Tappa is distinctly her forte. She concluded her performance with a melodious jangra in Goond-Malhar, a unique folk form of Rajasthan with its own grammar and distinctive ragas. Bharat Bhushan Goswami on the sarangi, Vinay Mishra on the harmonium and Akhtar Hasan on the tabla gave  inspired  accompaniment.Also, Pandit Debu Chaudhuri with Panchali Nandi assisting him on the sitar and Rashid Mustafa on the tabla, gave a scintillating sitar recital. The most appropriate raga of the hour Bageshri saw Chaudhuri in his element. Even Panchali followed her illustrious guru enthusiastically with a remarkable mandra vistaar during the alap-jod sequence.The next evening offered regional folk music by students of Sumadhur Hansadhwani, a vocal recital by Malobika Bhattacharya and Annamacharya Sankeertana by Sumitra Guha.The festival concluded with a memorable Miyan Malhar by Ustad Asad Ali Khan on the Rudra veena, who also spoke about his historical instrument and the raga he was going to perform. He was ably accompanied on the pakhawaj by Mohan Shyam Sharma. Keeping up its tradition of annually honouring eminent artistes, Sumadhur Hansadhwani honoured Ustad Sabri Khan and Pandit Bhajan Sopori this year.
