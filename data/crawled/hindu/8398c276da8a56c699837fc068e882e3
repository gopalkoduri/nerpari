VA lovelorn girl in Nagpur sends a letter to the one she wants to marry. Her brother is a baddie who opposes the match. The hero comes to Nagpur post haste, and carries her off. The brother gives chase. A fight ensues, and the hero defeats the brother, but spares his life. Sounds like a very contemporary story, doesn't it? It is in fact the story of Rukmini's love for Lord Krishna and their marriage. And where does Nagpur come in? &#8220;Nagpur,&#8221; said Dr. Prameela Gurumurthy, &#8220;is the present day name of Koundinyapuram, the capital of the Kingdom of Vidarbha. King Bheeshmaka, who ruled over Vidarbha, had five sons, none of whom endeared himself to the parent. But the sixth child was a girl- Rukmini, whose obsession with Krishna began even when she was a child.&#8221;Dr. Prameela's Harikatha on &#8216;Rukmini Kalyanam' on November 26, was part of the Embar Vijayaraghavachariar birth centenary celebrations, organised by Narada Gana Sabha Trust, at Asthika Samajam. Harikatha is not an easy art to master. It requires wide reading, a good voice and the ability to connect with the audience. The story of Rukmini's love for Krishna has all the elements that could make it a riveting narration, but Dr. Prameela's harikatha lacked zing.It was a sedate narration of events leading up to the final denouement, the boredom relieved only by the musical interludes. Cross references and a more analytical presentation could have taken the presentation to a higher intellectual plane.Dr. Prameela consulted her notes every now and then, and this impeded the flow of the narrative. She began with an introduction to what the art of harikatha is all about, and also spoke about Embar's contributions to the art.Considering that Kalyanapuram Aravamaudachariar and R. Krishnaswamy, Secretary, Narada Gana Sabha, had already spoken on these topics, a repetition by Dr.Prameela was unnecessary. A precious ten minutes was lost this way, leaving only 50 minutes for her Harikatha.Sense of humourThere were a couple of slips, when Dr. Prameela said Krishna was the son of Vasuki! But here her capacity to think on her feet and her sense of humour came to the rescue.After apologising to the audience, she said, &#8220;Now where on earth did I get Vasuki from? I suppose I must have somehow taken the first part of &#8216;Vasudeva' and the last letters of &#8216;Devaki' and arrived at this amalgam- Vasuki!&#8221;The choice of Tyagaraja's &#8216;Sri Narada' (Kaanada) to mark the entry of Sage Narada into the story was apt. In fact it was the choice of songs and Dr. Prameela's rendering of them that stood out in the Harikatha. Mention must be made of Tiruppazhanam Panchapakesa Sastri's composition &#8216;Enta Sogasugaadeyamma,' which had an enticing folksy lilt. Nitya, Vidya and Subhashree sang along with Prameela, who hopes to train them in Harikatha too. Guru Bharadwaj on the mridangam and Venkatasubramaniam on the ghatam provided support.On the whole it was a good musical evening. But what about the Harikatha? Well, maybe the next time all the other elements of a Harikatha will fall in place too.
