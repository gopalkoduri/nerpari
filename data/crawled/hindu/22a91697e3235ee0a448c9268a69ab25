VA rasika was struck by the consistency and evenness of Gayatri Girish&#8217;s style. Her clarity of articulation contributed to the clear stream of exposition. The play of her manodharma was marked by restraint and her expression by precision. The welcome feature was that even in the spontaneity of her presentation there was a method. Inspiration, sense of balance and suitable technique were intelligently handled. She draped ragas and kirtanas with  respectability.On hearing the string of songs rendered by Gayatri Girish, it became evident that Tyagaraja&#8217;s compositions are really the saving grace of to-day&#8217;s concerts. The rendering clearly revealed her veneration for the composer. It was an interpretative dip into their musical wealth. The grandeur of the kirtanas had the motivation of her high ideals.Of the three raga alapanas sung, Sahana took the pride of place. The exhilaration of raga bhava, stirring emotional intensity and the chiselled sancharas unfolding its beauteous facets spoke of a mind far away from clich&#233;s shifting images of Sahana&#8217;s nuances were both fascinating and felicitous. She has well understood that alapana has deeper import than merely running after scales.The kirtana was &#8216;Giripai Nelakonna.&#8217; Gayatri brought out the poetic pulse of the great song with a minimum of fuss. The ravishing sentiment, the life breath of the kirtana, and its profound depth swelled as the interpretation progressed.Getting a lift from the opening Pancharatna &#8216;Jagadananda Karaka,&#8217; (Nattai) and the piece, &#8216;Nee Bhakti&#8217; (Jayamanohari), two other songs, &#8216;O! Rajeevaksha&#8217; (Arabhi) and &#8216;Ennalu Oorake&#8217; (Subhapantuvarali) stabilised the quality of the concert.Purvikalyani (&#8216;Paraloka Sadaname&#8217;) and Madhyamavati (&#8216;Venkatesa Nannu&#8217;) were the other alapana ragas.Gamakas, karvais and limited brigas were well harmonised in the raga imagery.Mysore Srikanth (violin), in his solo versions of the ragas, synchronised fertile manodharma with disciplined sanchara framework. His quality consciousness was visible in his contribution to the success of the concert. Shertalai Anantakrishnan (mridangam) was a cut above some percussionists in that. His play spoke of the value of sensitive gentleness of the instrument. This aspect came to the fore when he played for the Sahana kirtana. He showed great concern for rhythmic classicism.
