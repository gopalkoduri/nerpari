VIn her concert for Fifty-fifty Club, Varalakshmi Anandkumar aimed at a genuine absorption of the capacity of Tyagaraja's kirtanas to contribute to the success of her effort. Her objective was not in pursuit of frills and thrills but to just make her recital pleasant. So she did not flirt with ragas and songs but conveyed her sincerity to professional needs.Varalakshmi's emphasis in rendering kirtanas was to present the quality of patanthara. It was not just her fervour that rasikas respected but her awareness of her limitations in her expository technique.Rich and subduedSimilarly her controlled alapana-pattern of Ritigowla (&#8216;Cherarava Demi Ra'), Varali (&#8216;Eti Jenma') and Khambodi (&#8216;Sri Raghuvara Aprameya') confined strictly to the traditional sancharas. There was a sense of calmness in such an approach. Towards this end, her creative motivation was reflected in her manodharma. At the same time her understanding to get an insight into nuances needed intensity. To some extent her choice of Tyagaraja's kirtanas mirrored the dynamism of true Carnatic music. The accuracy in rendering them was her main task conforming to defined guidelines built over decades. Of the three ragas which she took up for vinyasa, Khambodi topped the list because of its distinctive flavour. In the brief development she touched the salient pidis to capture the raga's radiant shades. The simplicity was endearing and capped by the not-often-sung item &#8216;Sri Raghuvara Aprameya.' She did justice to the swara-sahitya component of the song. The kirtana carried Khambodi fragrance, both rich and subdued.The other two pieces &#8212; &#8216;Eti Jenma' and &#8216;Chera Rava Demi Ra' were just prosaic. There was patanthara exactitude, but lacked aesthetic maturity. The other items were &#8216;Vallabha Nayakasya' (Begada), &#8216;Gunijanaadi Nuta' (Gurjari) and &#8216;Chinna Natena' (Kalanidhi). Varalakshmi had the right support in the accompanists &#8212; K.P. Nandini (violin) and Nellai Balaji (mridangam). The free flow of sancharas in raga alapanas in the violinist's solo version added a pleasant edge to the concert. There was not only clarity in her play, but equal merit in it. The percussion artist nourished the songs with great care and in the thani displayed well-matured laya delineation.
