V&#8216;Amazing&#8217; falls short in describing Shubhomita. No, she is not glamorous, glitzy or aggressive like most young aspirants.Appearance-wise  she looks like a simple, modest &#8216;girl next-door&#8217; who, during her stage concerts, consults Partho Banerjee, her tabla-player husband, at every given opportunity.But appearances are deceptive, no doubt. Because, whenever she faces the microphone, her total persona transforms into sheer melody with each microtone steeped in pristine purity. While her popular Bengali songs have taken her to the starry heights, her sporadic recitals from some prestigious classical platforms have mesmerised even the purists.Probably that is why Jagori, a classical musician-wives&#8217; association, under the stewardship of Chandana Chakrabarty (wife of Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty) invited Shubhomita to offer a musical homage to the late Badal Pradhan &#8212; a  fastidious and completely committed &#8216;servant&#8217; of music and Masters.As expected there were a lot of classical musicians in the audience. Nobody was in a mood to claim that expert handling of classical along with lighter idioms cannot be mastered by one.Their rapt attention was enough to show that the barrier between the genres was wiped out clean by this astounding vocalist.She did not seek the support of a harmonium with notated lyrics on a stand. Nothing, except a microphone, stood between her and her audience.The stream of songs along with some interesting anecdotes flowed down from her incredible memory and, supported by the warmth of her gentle stance and soft hand gestures, struck an instant rapport with the listeners.She stringed a multi-coloured garland of songs. Some stirred deep pathos. Some were immersed in the beauty of ragas while some exhibited complex chromatic notes intertwined with rhythmic patterns. The erudite were awed by the easy flow and superb clarity of intricate melodic phrases. Her jazzy songs thrilled a packed Uttam Mancha.Everything was arranged in a fashion to get the pulse of a debutante racing: Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty was there to release her &#8216;Puja&#8217; album; Pintu Bhattacharya, veteran singer belonging to the golden era of Bangla Gaan, arrived to inaugurate the event hosted by Sangeet Piyasi &#8212; an organization famous for its successful classical soirees &#8212; and almost all the musicians of Kolkata, both from classical and other genres, were among the listeners.To top it all, popular singing star Shrikanto Acharya was waiting to offer a grand finale.But despite all these and the fact that she had been playing  second fiddle to renowned tabla exponent Samar Saha, her husband, for more than a decade now, Madhumita Saha&#8217;s grit and passion for music saw her through.Her confident presentation of some hit Bengali songs along with some original ones came as a very pleasant surprise.Probably her solid foundation in classical under the able guidance of Pandit Arun Bhaduri and her post-marriage residence, along with her guru&#8217;s, within the four walls of ITC Sangeet Reasearch Academy kept the candle glowing despite her huge backstage commitments.
