VAditya Music India P Ltd.Namagiripettai KrishnanNagaswaram &#8212; Audio CDPrice Rs. 99Carnatic instrumental music attracts a larger audience, if the artists adopt a vocalist approach. Instrumental liberties may be taken but should be kept to a bare minimum.The rasikas will be able to appreciate the fare offered more, if they derive the same satisfaction of listening to a good vocal performance.Namagiripettai Krishnan, one of the leading nagaswaram players of his times, has presented a soulful and gamaka-oriented display of his talents in this recording brought out by Aditya Music (India) Pvt. Ltd.Krishnan&#8217;s selection of kritis, comprises of popular and familiar ones.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Thera Theeyagaradha&#8217; (Gowli Pantu ) is the opening number and is a sedate version.The Vasantha Bhairavi vinyasa is arresting with sancharas and prayogas, which can be vocalised well. &#8216;Nee Daya Radha&#8217; of the saint follows briskly.Nagaswaram players have found Mysore Vasudevachar&#8217;s Dharmavati composition &#8216;Bhajana Seya&#8217; suitable for the wind instrument and many exponents have included this song in their repertoire.The alapana and the kriti rendition come out well in Krishnan&#8217;s playing.A tellingly brief exposition of &#8216;Chaya Tarangini&#8217; precedes Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Krupa Juchutaku.&#8217;The alapana shines with strict adherence to the raga lakshana.Hindolam is the melody offered on a broad canvas. &#8216;Mamavathu Sri Saraswathi&#8217; (Mysore Vasudevachar) is a bhava rich rendition with a clear understanding of the lyrics.The solfa passages played by Krishnan and K. Murugan culminate in a simple but catchy korvai after the kuraippu.&#8216;Brochevarevarura&#8217; (Khamas) and the Annamacharya devotional &#8216;Kshirabdi Kanyakagu&#8217; (Kurinji) bring this recording to a good finish. The thavil accompaniment by K. Arumugam and A. Manikandan is of a good standard.
