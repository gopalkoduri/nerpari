VS hrilakshmi's veena recital under the auspices of Shri Thyagaraja Sangeetha Sabha, Mysore, demonstrated a dedicated approach to music. The artiste displayed appreciable fluency and imagination, irrespective of a few shortcomings.The compositions she had selected fully favoured her sober approach. As there were no tricky tags either while working on the fret or while plucking the strings, compositions like &#8220;Chakkani Rajamargamu&#8221; (Kharaharapriya-Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Bhajanaseyarada&#8221; (Dharmavati &#8212; Vasudevacharya) distinctly stood apart in convincing the listeners with appreciably infused moods of devotion.She drew the alapanas methodically in both the above ragas. A few strains of tribhinna gamakas added lustre to the taana sections while elaborating Kharaharapriya. Both the above presentations enjoyed lively passages of kalpanaswaras.Only deterring factor to her otherwise good concert was the tuning of her instrument, which caused uneasiness throughout.Some of the other inclusions were &#8220;Jaya Jaanaki Kaantha&#8221; (Naata-Purandaradasa), &#8220;Telisi Rama Chintanato&#8221; (Purnachandrika - Thyagaraja), &#8220;Sakalagrahabala&#8221; (Atana-Purandaradasa) and Thillana (Dhanashri-Swathi Thirunal).Both the percussionists, S. Jayaram (mridanga) and S. Manjunath (ghata) sensing the gentleness of the instrument and the mild predisposition of the artiste, provided able accompaniment, and shone in the thani avarthana.***V. Deshikachar's Academy of Music &#8211; Sushira &#8212; has conducted a three-day music festival in memory of the flute maestro Deshikachar. On the inaugural day, the audience witnessed a flute recital by the duo, B.K. Anantharam and Amith Nadig. Veena Suresh (violin), V.S. Rajagopal (mridanga) and S. Manjunath (ghata) accompanied the artistes.The concert prompted a mixed response in many respects. While on the one hand, it demonstrated the skill of the artistes who explored their instruments to the best of their ability, on the other, the concert lagged behind in creating the necessary emotive aspects, which the competent artistes could have created had they trod a direct and simple path.However, there were moments that offered the listener a consistency of experience. Take for example the first few presentations: &#8220;Mahaganapathim&#8221; (Naata - Dikshithar) and &#8220;Jnanamosagarada&#8221; (Purvikalyani-Thyagaraja).Particularly, alapana in Purvikalyani proved remarkably convincing. The narration of the text appeared slightly faster considering the general import of the lyrics. Yet, by the time the creative and enthusiastic flautist entered into the level of improvising the swaras, it appeared he had lost track of the sentimental aspect of those lyrics. Thus stress on virtuosity led to a noticeable digression from the main spirit.&#8220;Evarura Ninuvina&#8221; (Mohana) of Vasudevacharya thrived on imaginatively drawn alapana. Nevertheless, compared to the extent of elaboration, one desired a few passages of kalpanaswaras (and as a result, the number lost a necessary element of proportion).In spite of young Amith's exemplary imagination and extempore in the expatiation of Keeravani, ostentatious lighter touches marginally diminished the grandeur of that raga. Thyagaraja's &#8220;Kaligiyunte Gada&#8221; preceded elaborate swarakalpana finally leading to an interesting thani avarthana.
