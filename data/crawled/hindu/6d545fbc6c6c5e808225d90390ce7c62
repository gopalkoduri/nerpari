VHowever, it was difficult to guess the amount of hard work that has gone in when one saw the ease with which Kaleeshabi wielded the nagaswaram. Due to incessant practice the artistes have made an arduous task their second nature and they succeeded in coaxing the instrument to pour the brigas and karvais with their nimble, dancing fingers.The couple began with &#8216;Chalamela,&#8217; the varnam in Nattakurinji. By the time they finished &#8216;Gajavadhana&#8217; in Sriranjani, the continuously trickling crowd filled most of the hall. &#8216;Gana Murthe&#8217; in Ganamurthi and &#8216;Endharo Mahanubhavulu&#8217; in Sree ragam were received with hearty applause.The delineation of Karaharapriya was a masterpiece that lasted nearly 30 minutes with contributions from both artistes. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Rama Neeyeda&#8217;  was a beauty and it was followed by fireworks of swarakalpanas and an imposing thani avarthanam on the tavil by T.V.Muthukumar and P.M.Shankar.&#8216;Aananda Nadamaduvar&#8217; in Purvikalyani and Kamalabdhakula&#8217; in Brindavana Saranga were presented elaborately with alapana and kalpanaswaras. &#8216;Sharavanabhava Guhane&#8217; in Kannada and &#8216;Rara Maa Intidhaga&#8217; in Asaveri were fast and crisp.The audience, mainly comprising senior citizens, enjoyed the concert immensely.To give an opportunity to  up and coming artistes &#8212; R.M. Kausiga, a student of fashion designing and Aparna Karthikeyan, a class nine student, (disciples of Pandanallur Chandrasekar and Vijeya Jaya) &#8212; Nadham, Coimbatore, had organised a concert at Rathna Regent.Both of them  made a good beginning with the varnam, &#8216;Sami Ninne Kori&#8217; in Sree ragam and went on to present &#8216;Sri Vathapi Ganapathiye&#8217; by Papanasam Sivan in Sahana. They are still in the learning process and are not yet ready for alapana and niraval. Though most of the songs they presented were heavy with a lot of sangatis, the girls did justice to the dignity of the kritis by being faithful to their patantharam.&#8216;Marivere Dikkevvaru&#8217; (Lathangi - Patnam Subramania Iyer), &#8216;Sabhapathiku Veru Deivam&#8217; (Abhogi - Gopalakrishna Bharathiar), &#8216;Varanarada Narayana Smarana&#8217; (Vijayasri -Tyagaraja) and &#8216;Saroja Dhala Netri&#8217; (Sankarabharanam - Syama Sastri) were some of the kritis sung by the duo.After a brief attempt at raga delineation by Kaushiga, they sang &#8216;Unnaiyallal Vere Gathiyillai Amma&#8217; in Kalyani. Palghat V. Sivaramakrishnan on the violin was  at home and his raga delineation was  good. Erode K. Srinivasan&#8217;s thani on the mridangam   was well done, though it appeared a bit too long.The singers presented two rare kritis of Oothukkadu Venkatakavi, &#8216;Pazhamo Pazham&#8217; on the greatness of Bhagavatham and &#8216;Sri Ragavesan Thanakku Mithileshan Seithaan Janavasam,&#8217; describing the grandeur of Rama&#8217;s bridal procession at Mithila.Their performance can be passed off as satisfactory considering the fact that they sang on a platform for budding artistes. But if they are planning to take music seriously, they should give it a lot of time in order to gain a proper foothold and confidence.
