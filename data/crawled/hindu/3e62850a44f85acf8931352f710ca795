VAristotle once said, &#8220;The aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things, but their inward significance.&#8221; Bhagyalakshmi Chandrasekar, during her two-hour recital recently under the aegis of Gayathri Fine Arts, did not sim\u000aply play the  veena, but brought out the richness of Carnatic music.  She also brought to the fore the beauty of this instrument which is considered very close to the human voice, and often, when producing gamakas, even more than the human voice.The very opening piece, the Saveri raga Adi tala varnam,  was delightful.  In &#8220;Guruarul thiruarul&#8221; in  Aboghi, she brought out the raga bhava. The swara formats  emphasised her manodharma talents.  Bhagyalakshmi  is never tempted towards lighter music to popularise the veena, The hallmark of Bhagyalakshmi&#8217;s presentation of Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Diwakaratanujam saniswaram&#8221; in raga Yadukulakamboji was  the alap,  wherein the complete essence of this raga was brought out. Two more of Dikshitar&#8217;s  compositions, one the fast tempo &#8220;Puraharanandana&#8221; in the raga Hamir Kalyani and  the other the slow-paced &#8220;Akhilandeswari&#8221; in raga Dwijavanti, were emotive. As her main item, Bhagyalakshmi presented a ragam-taanam-pallavi in raga Shanmukhapriya set to Chatusra jati Jhampa tala.   After a fine sketch of the raga,  the taanam had a telling effect in the Delhi Tamil Sangam auditorium.  She also presented creative swaraprastaras,  following them up with ragamalika swaraprastaras in Mohanam and Subhapantuvarali. However, Bhagyalakshmi should reduce her simultaneous playing in two octaves, which she did often.  This produced a jarring sound because of the  contact mike. It  also somewhat dilutes the original sound of the veena.Mysore P.S. Sridhar on the mridangam and M. Yagnaraman on the morsing provided understanding support,  and their tani avartanam in Chatusra jati Jhampa tala was enjoyable. On the whole, this concert will linger long in the memories of Delhi rasikas.Before Bhagyalakshmi&#8217;s concert, Delhi&#8217;s young G. Sowmya, a disciple of S. Viswanathan, put up an impressive show.  The confident youngster excelled in the kalpita  (music as learnt) segment of concert presentation, as exemplified by Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Panchamatanga&#8221; in raga Malahari, Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Vidajaladura&#8221; in  Janaranjani, Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Rangapuravihara&#8221; in  Brindavana Saranga and even Purandaradasa&#8217;s &#8220;Harinarayana&#8221; in Revati.However, as for the manodharma  (creative aspects like raga alap, niraval, swaraprastaras) segment, she has to walk that extra mile.  Concert structuring should be looked into, too. R. Sridhar on the violin, B. Manohar on the mridangam and Harinarayanan on the ghatam provided Sowmya good support.  The tani avartanam led by young Manohar was particularly  impressive.
