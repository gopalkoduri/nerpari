VThe good old veena has great potential to produce sound close to the human voice. But only a handful veena recitals are organised in the Capital. India International Center&#8217;s gesture in organising one such concert  is laudable. The Hyderabad-based artiste Kaza Subhashini Sastry, who has learnt from notable gurus like Vasa Krishnamurthy, Manchala Jagannadha Rao and Emani Sankara Sastry, presented a one-and-half-an-hour long veena recital.Subhashini&#8217;s talent came to the fore in the brief recital. Whether it was while presenting the compositions or during the improvisation techniques &#8212; like playing alapana and  swaraprastharas, the sound that Subhashini produced in her instrument, was very pleasing and  of high quality. Sadly, she did not quite utilise this opportunity to bring out the complete potential of this instrument. She presented compositions which were all based on Janya ragas  like light and lilting Jayantasri, Hamsanadam and Kapi, etc. At some point of time, one expected her to  take up a song composed in a Melakarta raga or a Ghana raga which could have given a better  outcome.Her main item was Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Samaja vara gamana&#8217; in raga Hindolam. She presented this composition well. Traditionally, in a veena recital after playing alapana, taanam could be played followed by a composition , unlike in vocal concerts or other instruments&#8217; where the taanam is followed by presentation of a &#8216;pallavi&#8217; (an advanced stage in concert presentation based entirely on creativity). Subhashini seemed to follow this tradition. She presented a fine alaap of the raga Hindolam and pleasing tanams not only in this raga but also followed it in ragas Mohanam and Kalyani. Towards the end she also presented creative swaraprastaras in all these three ragas. However, Subhashini distorted the phrase &#8216;Samaja vara gamana&#8217;  &#8212; originally composed in raga Hindolam by switching over to raga Mohanam and then to raga Kalyani. One felt that Subhashini should not have done this. K. Sreeram provided good support on the mridangam.Earlier, India International Center had also organised a presentation titled &#8216;Raga Therapy: The Miracle of Microtones&#8217; by Dr. T. V. Sairam of Nada Center for Music Therapy, Chennai. During this presentation, Sairam&#8217;s lecture was informative, but his backup music demonstration and that of Padma on veena woefully fell short, making it difficult to fully appreciate the contents of his lecture.Elsewhere, at the Chinmaya Mission, Vijay Siva presented a memorable vocal recital on the last day of Sree Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha&#8217;s thematic music festival &#8216;Bhakthi Pravaham&#8217;. The theme for the evening was &#8216;Rama Rasam&#8217;.  It was a delightful experience to hear compositions of Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshidar, Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar, Patnam Subramanya Iyer, Mysore Vasudavachar, etc on the theme from the highly talented disciple of the late D. K. Jayaraman.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Sriraghuvara&#8217; in raga Kambhoji was the main item of Vijay Siva&#8217;s recital. Vijay Siva handled this composition well and brought out the bhava of the lyrics to the fore. Earlier, he presented an outstanding alapana of this raga and the swaraprastaras that he presented towards the end, spoke  highly of his calibre.  Vittal Ramamurthy on the violin, J. Vaidhyanathan on the mridangam and H. Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam made significant contributions in making this concert a memorable one.
