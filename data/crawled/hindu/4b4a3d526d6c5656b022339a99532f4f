VShe is almost a forgotten artiste and surfaced after nearly four decades. Nada Bharathi takes credit for literally forcing her to give a vocal concert and another programme later, even while making her sit on a chair.Jayamani literally shocked the audience on this occasion with her voice culture, style and knowledge. Her voice resonated like that of a young vocalist and her presentation was totally traditional. Her concert on the last day of the festival was a real climax with her scintillating performance. The versatile artiste belongs to a musical family, learnt vocal from her mother V.Lakshmi, who is 86-year-old and yet performs.Jayamani opened her recital with a GaneshaVandanam,aslokaand another composition on Lord Narasimha. She went for delineation of Ranjani with raresangathiesthat spoke of her knowledge.  Thyagaraja&#8217;sDurmargacharadhamuluwith complexswarakalpanafigured in thisraga. The otherragashe chose to present was Bilahari, forNarasimha Nanu Brovawith goodswaracombinations.Sarasijanabha Sodariof Deekshitar in Nagagandhari was a pleasant addition to her repertoire. Kalyani was the main attraction.Etavunaraof Thyagaraja was an apt choice with beautifulswaracombinations. Venkatakrishna on violin brought out the flavour of Bilahari and Kalyani.  Srinivasa Gopalan on mridangam lent an active and soothing support.  Jayamani concluded with Sadasiva Bhramendra&#8217;sbhajan,Nahirein Sindhubhairavi and a RamadasukirtanaRamabhadra Raara.
