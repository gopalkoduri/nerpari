VLord Rama has inspired some of the most exquisite lyrics in Indian classical music. And his festival Sri Rama Navami also occasions some of the biggest musical events of the year in Bangalore. Among these were the National Music Festival organised by\u000a Sri Rajarajeshwari Kala Niketan (run by Kuchipudi exponent Veena Murthy Vijay) in collaboration with Drishti Art Centre and Ananya-GML Cultural Academy.Opening the weeklong festival was celebrated vocalist M.S. Sheela accompanied by J.K. Sridhar on violin, Anoor Dattatreya Sharma on mridangam and Narayanamurthy on ghatam. After the customary opening varnam came &#8220;Raghunayaka Neepadayugamule&#8221; (Hamsadhwani) followed by an elegant &#8220;Sogasujooda Tharama&#8221; (Kannadagowla). A glowing alapana of Lathangi preceded Patnam Subramaniam Iyer&#8217;s &#8220;Marivere Dikkevaru&#8221; with neraval at &#8220;Dharaloni Neesaati&#8221; followed by swarakalpana.After Muthaih Bhagavathar&#8217;s &#8220;Sarasamukha Sakalabhagyane&#8221; in Gowdmalhar came the piece de resistance, &#8220;Kaddanuvariki&#8221;, Thygaraja&#8217;s majestic krithi in Todi. It was preceded by an alapana and then a taanam. From an artiste of Sheela&#8217;s calibre, an impromptu taanam can be as masterly as one which would have been a planned item of her concert. After that delectable taanam for which violinist Sridhar did a competent follow-up, Sheela proceeded to the lyric which she embellished with neraval and swarakalpana, predictably at &#8220;Niddura Nirakarinchi&#8221;. In her Kaddanuvariki sangathis and rendition style, Sheela reminded many of the doyen ML Vasanthakumari. She concluded with a devarnama.On the next day, renowned vocalist S. Shankar performed, accompanied by son S. Ramani. Competent support was provided by B.R. Srinvas&#8217; mridangam and Mysore Sateesh&#8217;s violin. The sedate and scholarly concert of Shankar had a preponderance of compositions on Sri Rama. Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Yentha Muddo&#8221; in the rare raga Bindumalini came up early in the concert. Muthuswami Dikshithar&#8217;s &#8220;Ramachandra Bhavayami&#8221; in Vasantha was crisp. The main piece was the immaculately rendered Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Pakkala Nilabadi&#8221; with neraval and swarakalpana at the usual Thanuvuche.Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Amma Ravamma&#8221; with swaraprasthara at &#8220;Thamarasadalanethru&#8221; showed emotional intensity even as it underlined the beauty of the raga Kalyani. Following it were &#8220;Bhavayami Raghuramam&#8221; (Ragamalika), Swathi Thirunal&#8217;s masterpiece, and the lively Purandaradasa devarnama &#8220;Thambura Meetidava&#8221;. A fitting finale was provided by Thyagaraja&#8217;s mangalam, &#8220;Pavamana Suthudu&#8221; (Sourashtram).Veena artiste Suma Sudhindra&#8217;s seemingly effortless artistry is always a delight to watch. An artiste whose veena-play can be sedate, dazzling, soft, and power-packed by turns as needed, she always impresses with her virtuosity and range. She started off with a varnam &#8220;Evari Bodhana&#8221; (Abhogi). Then came the Karahapriya gem &#8220;Rama Neesamana&#8221; of Thyagaraja after a brief, but highly satisfying alapana. A more leisurely alapana preceded &#8220;Samajavara Gamana&#8221; (Hindolam) which ended with scintillating swaraprasthara. Dikshitar&#8217;s Dwijawanthi raga &#8220;Akhilandeshwari&#8221; was presented with deep aesthetic sense and &#8220;Annapurne Visalakshi&#8221; (Sama) was soothing.Suma also treated the audience to the Kanakadasa composition &#8220;Baro Krishnayya&#8221;, a delightful tillana in Karnaranjani, and the ever-popular &#8220;Bhagyadalakshmi&#8221; (Madhyamavathi). In the more stylistic and scintillating parts of her recital, Suma reminded one of her famous guru C. Chittibabu. B.C. Manjunatha on mridanga and Krishna Prasad on ghatam gave good support.The latter days of the festival featured a vocal concert by Nagamani Srinath, flute recital by child prodigy Akash Satish and classical dances by Samanvay Group, Drishti Dance Ensemble, Samarpan Group, and Deepti Mukund. The festival concluded with T.S. Sathyavathi&#8217;s vocal concert.
