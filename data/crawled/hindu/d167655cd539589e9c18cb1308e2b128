VKoviladi Madhwaprasad presented a vocal concert at the monthly &#8216;Eppadi Padinaro' programme organised by Rasika Ranjana Sabha in association with Sri Krishna Sweets at the FGN Hall of the sabha recently. He was ably accompanied by T.K. Ramanujacharyalu on the violin and Madhusudhanan on the mridangam.Well-temperedHe commenced the concert with a fast Abhogi varnam (&#8216;Sabapathikku'). Later he rendered Ritigowla (&#8216;Tathvamariaya Tharama') and Jaganmohini (&#8216;Sobillu') with rich swara sallies and pleasant sargams. His Darbar kriti (&#8216;Sri Venugopala') and the one in Varali (&#8216;Eti Janma'), rendered in two speeds with telling swaras, were properly structured.The vocalist took up Purvikalyani for extensive treatment in Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar's kriti (&#8216;Paramapavana Rama') with exhaustive niravals, to which he did full justice and the violin maestro, Ramanujacharyalu, was not only in tune with the vocalist but also offered stately import throughout the concert. The well tempered thani of Madhusudhanan, was well received by the audience.Madhwaprasad's tukkadas in Behag and Sama were impressive and his asura sadhakam always helped him in his ghana voice through out the recital.
