VImagine the breathtakingly sweet resonance of the flute soaring across the spiritual interiors of the Shivam temple. Ronu Majumdar's flute recital last week was an evening of sheer poetry as the celebrated maestro played on the occasion of the 85th birthday celebrations of Satya Saibaba.Descriptions like the Dr. Feelgood of the Indian flute, or even as the successor to Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia, don't seem quite so farfetched when it comes to listening to the flautist in concert. Selecting the best from a wide assortment of songs suited for the ceremony, Majumdar coaxed melodious timbres of sound from his bansuri flute. Even as the clouds burst overhead, the rains seemed to shift and then settle in harmony with the music.Raga Yamun Kalyan was the perfect choice; it built up the fundamental beauty of the lower notes before spilling over into a cheerful explosion of sound. Majumdar also selected a variety of bhajans for the evening, starting with the famous Payoji Maine Ram Ratan Dhan Payo, celebrating the love and blessings of Lord Ram. He also chose to play another famous Ram bhajan, Tulsidas' Thumak chalat Ramachandra, for its lovely depth of devotion towards the child Ram.The magical flute is the ultimate clich&#233;, but the stereotype proved itself in this case as Majumdar produced notes that gravitated between melting, heartbreaking and earthy.A musician who played with the likes of George Harrison and Ravi Shankar, and at venues across the globe, he also performed the track B.N.R. [Bengal Nagpur Railway] from his album A Traveller's Tale, a medley of percussion and flute with glorious consequences.Majumdar was accompanied by Pt. Ramdas Palsule on the tabla and his own student Pramod on the flute. Whether the trio performed Sai bhajans or one of Gandhiji's favourites, Vaishnav jan to tene kahiye, which was vocally immortalised by M.S. Subbalakshmi, the dulcet tones flowed across the universe in a magical confluence of sound.
