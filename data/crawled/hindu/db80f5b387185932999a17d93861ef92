VThe morning session of December 30 commenced with a prayer by Dharini and Lakshmi Madhav, students of Sulochana Pattabhiraman. The morning session was dedicated to veena in a vidwan, the late Chitti Babu and a brief note about the musician was presented by Prof. T.R. Subramanian.The main presentation of the morning session was a lecture-demonstration on &#8216;Different Schools and Styles in Dhrupad Singing&#8217; by Prof. Ritwik Sanyal of Banaras Hindu University. Tracing the origin of the Dhrupad form to the Prabandha system and to the Dhruva-pada of Man Singh Tomar, the author mentioned that it denoted, not just the song but, the entire style which included the Alapa, Joda, Jhala and the dhrupada song. Referring to his own tutelage under Zia Mouinuddin Daagar and the link to the Been tradition, he sang an alapa in Raga Bhairava and explained the different stages of development of alapa, namely, Akaara, Dagar and Andolita.Among the various schools of Dhrupada the prominent ones, apart from Daagar, are those of Bihar or Darbhanga (rhythm dominated), Betia and Vishnupur. The other compositional types like Dhamaar and Saadara, that go with the Dhrupad style were also explained. After a brief reference to the Haveli or temple tradition of Dhrupad the speaker dwelt a bit on the early years of 20th century when Dhrupad almost went out of vogue  and on the revival of the tradition in 1970s.The last session of the lecture-demonstration was on December 31. The prayer was rendered by Shyam Prakash, a disciple of Dr. S.A.K. Durga. The session was dedicated to Sri Hulugur Krishanamacharyulu, a musician scholar. The note on his contribution was presented by Dr. M.B. Vedavalli.&#8216;A comparative analysis of four ragas Rudrapriya, Karnataka Kapi, Darbar and Kanada&#8217; was a group presentation by Chingleput  Ranganathan, Suguna Purushothaman,  N.Ramanathan,  Ritha Rajan and  R.S.Jayalakshmi. Introducing the topic, Ramanathan, who also moderated the discussion, pointed that the four ragas had quite a few overlapping and common phrases, with a song composed in one raga being rendered in the other and that each raga projected differing melodic images. The changing melodic complexion of Rudrapriya evident in the songs of Muttuswami Dikshitar and later composers was discussed. The tune of &#8216;Gananaayakam&#8217; of Dikshitar and &#8216;Sri Manini&#8217; of Tyagaraja and the mention of Rudrapriya as the raga of the song &#8216;Lavanya Rama,&#8217; normally attributed to the raga &#8216;Purnashadja&#8217; was also discussed. The later incorporation of &#8216;antara-gandhara&#8217; in Rudrapriya and its likeness to Hindustan Kapi was cited as the reason for taking up the raga Kapi.Illustrations of songs in Karnataka Kapi, devoid of Antara-ga and Kakali-ni were presented and discussed. It was pointed out that Hindustani Kapi of Karnataka music was similar to the raga Pilu of Hindustani system and that the &#8216;Kafi&#8217; of Hindustani was different altogether. The occurrence of Darbar like phrases in Karnataka Kapi led the discussion to Darbar. The discussion was very scholarly supported by large number of illustrations rendered by the participants and presented through audio recordings. The thrust of the exercise was on projecting the problem rather than arriving at a clear conclusion.(The report published on January 9 was not that of the concluding sessions as mentioned. The error is regretted.)
