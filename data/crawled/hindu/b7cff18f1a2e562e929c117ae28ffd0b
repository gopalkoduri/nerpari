VNagaswaram artistes Bangalore M. Kothandaraman and B.S.Ramesh Babu, and  vocalist Vijay Siva enthralled the music lovers of the temple town, who had gathered in good strength to pay homage to the nagaswaram maestro, the late Sheik Chinna Moulana.Kothandaraman and Ramesh Babu commenced with Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Gajananayutham&#8217; in Chakravakam. Kothandaraman played &#8216;Govardhanagiridhari&#8217; followed by a brief alapana of Hindolam. This was followed by the main piece, &#8216;Shivakameswari&#8217; in Kalyani, again a Muthuswami Dikshitar kriti. The song was preceded by an elaborate raga alapana which was marked by sweet and characteristic phrases of the raga. A scintillating thani avartanam followed with an engaging &#8216;sawal/jawab&#8217; exchange of thavil vidwans Mannargudi M.R.Vasudevan and Sendhamangalam A. Manikandan.The post-interval pieces included a Purandaradasa kriti, &#8216;Narayana&#8217; in Suddhadhanyasi, Thanjavur Sankara Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;Mahadeva Siva Sambo&#8217; in Revathi and concluded with a haunting Sindubhairvi, rendering &#8216;Thamburu Mittidhava&#8217; of Purandaradasa. The concert was  well received by the audience.Vijay Siva,  blessed with  a melodious voice, presented a concert filled with traditional flavour. He commenced  with the Swati Tirunal kriti, &#8216;Deva Deva&#8217; in Mayamalavagowla. Then he glided into a Tyagaraja kriti in Saranga  which was followed by the Maanchi piece of Syama Sastry, &#8216;Brovavamma&#8217;.Vijay Siva then embarked upon an elaborate presentation of Sankarabaranam; he traversed the full gamut of the majestic raga.  Violinist Charumathi Raghuraman  aptly responded with her short and brilliant alapana.This was followed by a short and sweet thani avartanam on the mridangam by Neyveli Narayanan.The next half-an-hour was a display of musical wizardry by Vijay Siva with a Ragam-Thanam-Pallavi in Aberi; after the pallavi came &#8216;Pankaja Kannanai Parthaal Urugu Nenjae,&#8217; wrapped up with a three-ragamalika swaraprasthara.  The post-pallavi session was replete with moving,  poignant pieces like Narayana Nalinayaka Lochana&#8217; in Sama and &#8216;Muddhugare Yasoda&#8217; in Kurinji. Then followed a series of viruthams in evocative ragamalika  and Kavadichindhu.
