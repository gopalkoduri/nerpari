VIt might look odd for a full fledged Hindustani concert to be held in the residence of the doyen of Carnatic music, Musiri Subramania Iyer. However, following the performance of a Hindustani violin recital by N. Rajam a couple of months ago in the monthly chamber music concert series in Musiri House, Pandit Janardhan Mitta was perhaps offered a slot in the evening.Before the concert, Janardhan explained the nuances of compositions between vocal and instrumental performance. He said they are slightly different in view of the special characteristics and limitations of the instrument. However, the instrumentalist tried  to be closest to the vocal. &#8220;Judicious combination of gayaki and tantrakari style enables me to do this&#8221; announced Janardhan, prior to the recital. For ragas Purya, Marva and Sohini he used the same notes for his demonstration.Pt. Janaradhan  then went on to play raga Purya elaborately, jod and vilambit in theen thaal. The ambience and the controlled stereo system added to the listening pleasure. It was a respectable gathering of  rasikas who sat face to face with the artist to enjoy the pure melody that poured out from the imagination of the sitar player. He took up Jogeshwari next, a blend of both Jog and Rageshwari, which he said, was discovered by his Guru, Pt. Ravi Shankar, in jap thaal (ten beats) followed by dhrut in ek thaal (12 beats).Raagamalika was the next piece in which Janardhan played Peelu, Sivaranjani, Desh, Kedar, Maund, Bahar and Mia Malhar, all blending so well that it was a bouquet of enchanting ragas.A Meera or Surdas bhajan would have been an ideal choice to round off the concert, but then Janardhan chose to conclude with Sindhubhairavi, the first segment set in Dadra followed by (tricky?) dhrut.The tabla player Rajendra Nakod from Bangalore collaborated well with the main artist to make the recital an enjoyable treat in a tranquil atmosphere.
