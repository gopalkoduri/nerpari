VA well-known troupe on the light music circuit with more than 5,000 shows the world over to their credit, Shankar's `Saadhaga Paravaigal,' has now come out with `Ayyan Ayyanae' &#151;  a CD on Lord Ayyappan, for which, Rajkumar's lyrics have been set to music by S. Sankarram.Beats that should make the devotee bristle with fervour are the highlight of the opening song, `Aadu Aattam.' Sung by Solar Sai the vibrant piece has its tempo touching a crescendo. Sai's timbre reminds you of Veeramani Raju's. That could be a reason for `Saadhaga Paravaigal' plumping for Sai's voice, for the devotional album.  `Thagathagavena,' is also a fast-paced offering in Solar Sai's voice. But it  is more a recitation with little of the musical. Another strong voice is Sunandan's &#151;  `Kaadu Malai' is his contribution.A sober solo, `Vaanam,' with Belly (!) Raj as the singer forms the second song in the list. The lyricist  turns to Telugu now and then in the last piece, `Raavaiya,' sung by Gopi and Sai Krishna. A badly composed number in filmi style!While on the subject, another song in which the cinematic slant is only too evident, is `Neyyil' rendered by Kavitha. A catchy tune with percussion that lends itself to a folksy dance style. The charanam, however, is not as appealing. Marked by profound thoughts in parts, the lyric of `Irumudi' appeals. Llaharee has sung this melody-based number.MALATHI RANGARAJANBottom Template Starts
