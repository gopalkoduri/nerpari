VOn the inaugural day &#8220;Kashiya Dasaru&#8221; written by Professor B.N. Sampath (published by The Indian Institute of Legal Literacy) was released.The book is a tribute-biography  of Kaashi Daasaru born in Coimbatore, who led the life of a true daasa in Kashi, as an ascetic servant,  and an altruist.Not being conversant in the Kannada script, he transliterated Purandaradasa&#8217;s compositions and sang them. He celebrated Purandaradasa Aradhana in Kashi every year for more than 40 years until his final departure.The author, then a professor of law in the Benaras Hindu University, having been intimately acquainted with the Kashi Daasaru, has recorded all the relevant and enlightening instances in this small book. On the occasion, Samirkumar Badasheshi emotively sang daasa sahithya in his soft, pleasing voice.The singer created a congenial atmosphere to dispel pride when he sang Vijayadasa&#8217;s &#8220;Garva rahitava maadi&#8221;, in praise of Purandaradasa. Gentle progression and soft intonations conveyed delicate emotions.Whereas, the melody accompanist Vishwanath (mandolin) improvised the interludes, the rhythm accompanist Raghu&#8217;s tekas and layakaris provided lively rhythm-framework. To praise the Lord of Vairagya (&#8220;Chandrachuda&#8221;- Purandaradasa), the singer selected Bhairagi Bhairav, which has inherent shades of detachment. Chanting the Pranava before the main lyrics spoke of his aesthetic sense of the context. The overall narration remained too plain, not being attended by any significant embellishments. Definite professional touches would have placed him on an advantageous foothold.Other inclusions were &#8220;Jagadoliruva manujarella&#8221;, &#8220;Nambide ninna paadava&#8221;, &#8220;Indu ninna morehokke Venkatesha&#8221; and so on.***On the first day of Purandara-Thyagaraja Tarunabharathi Sangithotsava at the same venue, R.C. Vijesh and M. Sunitha presented a Yugala Gaayana, accompanied by two more young artistes M.S. Sughosh (violin) and Keshava Sundar (mridanga).The duo synchronised excellently, and even the sancharas in the taara sthayi did not pose any hindrance. Akaras were smooth-retaining a crispness, irrespective of the intricacies involved while expanding the sangathis.They began with Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Raghunayaka&#8221; (Hamsadhwani) appending it with short passage of kalpanaswaras. It was a joy to hear the innocent voices singing Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Brochevarevare&#8221; (Shriranjani) with unalloyed dedication.Alapana in Kalyani before Purandaradasa&#8217;s &#8220;Dayamado Ranga dayamado&#8221; brought to  fore imaginative ideas the artiste has inculcated, but demanded gentle charm and polished inflections.The presentation comprised a neraval at &#8220;Ihaparagati neene&#8221; followed by kalpanaswaras. Bhairavi received a scholarly expatiation; zest and imagination flowing melodically. The fine gamakas subtly articulating in indicated areas vouchsafed the artiste&#8217;s keen sense of raagabhaava. They rendered swarakalpana in alternation, and the finishing swara phrases (moharas) terminated at precise mukthayas. Other inclusions were &#8220;Murahara nagadhara&#8221; (Purandaradasa) and &#8220;Neenyako ninna hangyako&#8221; (Ragamalika).
