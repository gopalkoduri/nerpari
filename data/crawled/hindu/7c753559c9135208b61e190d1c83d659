VKuldeep R. Pai is a promising vocalist who plays the violin, the harmonium and the flute.   His gurus are  N.P. Ramaswamy and Antony Master in Kochi. In addition to giving concerts, the Chennai-based musician  accompanies noted dancers on their tours\u000a. His performance in Kochi opened with a Ganesa slokam followed by a varnam in Todi. &#8216;Kalaharana,&#8217; a Tyagaraja kriti in Shudha saveri raga,  followed. Kuldeep follows madhyamakala in his kriti renditions. The raga follow-up by Vinu S. Anand was noteworthy for its rich timbre and feel. The Lavangi kriti &#8216;Omkaraakarini&#8217; was ably supported by Vinu.While he used a full-throated singing style for his raga and kriti renditions for &#8216;Venuganaloluni,&#8217; he went for a modulated, leisurely style of singing the neraval in &#8216;Vikasitha pankaja.&#8217; Kuldeep is at his best with the neraval, which was emphasised further in &#8216;Kamalambam bhajare&#8217; in Kalyani. His adherence to the notes was noteworthy during the swaraprasthara as he coupled notes in different octaves, which can be tricky  even for  senior musicians. &#8216;Bantureethikolu&#8217; in Hamsanadam was brisk and charming. Kuldeep sang  intricate swara passages for half and three fourth cycles of the tala. Cherthala Krishnakumar wonderfully supported him on the mridangam with tonal and rhythmic variations in the long swara passages.Giving due accent on the gamakas, without overdoing it, made the Kalyani alaapana a pleasurable experience. The Navavarana kriti of Dikshithar, &#8216;Kamalambam bhajare,&#8217; was presented well. Krishnakumar and Manjur Unnikrishnan gave a harmonized thani and the rehearsed last phase was presented well. A slokam &#8216;Akaashat patitam thoyam&#8217; in Sindhubhairavi and Nadanamakriya ragas culminated in Narayanatheerthar&#8217;s &#8216;Pahi pahi jaganmohana krishna.&#8217; The concert came to a close with the tillana in Kundalavarali.A varied kalapramana and emotive renditions could have made the concert more appealing. The concert was organised by Rasikapriya, Kochi.
