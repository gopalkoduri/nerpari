VIt was supposed to be a duet; but because of the indisposition of Saindavi, Pradeep Kumar gave a solo vocal recital in the up and coming artists' slot of Hamsadhwani music festival recently.Pradeep Kumar's talents have been recognised in small screen music shows; this 90-minute concert provided the discerning listeners to appreciate this youngster's pursuit to project himself as a sincere performer. Pradeep Kumar's vocal chords are soft, supple and soothing. In fact, at times, one feels that a little more open throated singing will make him a still better singer as far as Carnatic music is concerned.Nevertheless, Pradeep Kumar's raga exposition of Valaji and Poorvikalyani were substantial in all respects; there were adequate lengths of repose with acceptable ornamentation with brigas. In ``Jalandara supeetasthe" (Valaji), his neraval at ``Bhavaroga nivarani" was effective even without the attachment of kalpanaswaras. Later, the Syama Sastri kriti ``Ninnu vina gamari" in Poorvikalyani came with professional poignancy. A good thing about Pradeep Kumar is that he prefers to tread his path with care and delicacy, two essential ingredients for success.  Violinist Karaikkal Venkatasubramaniam and percussionist Koppu Nagarajan played their parts quite passionately.Absolute controlSubha Ganesan's voice took some time to settle; once settled, she performed with absolute control. Suddha Dhanyasi and ``Samodam" (Swati Tirunal), with long winding impressively woven kalpanaswaras at ``Sayanandoora nagari" were breezy. Subha's selections had some rare compositions like ``Neelayadakshi" in Paras (Syama Shastri), ``Kalavati kamalasana" in Kalavati (Dikshitar) and the major ``Enthuku nee manasu" in Kalyani (Tyagarja). She enjoyed impartial prop up of Neyveli Radhakrishnan on the violin and V.M. Ganesan on the mridangam.G. SWAMINATHANBottom Template Starts
