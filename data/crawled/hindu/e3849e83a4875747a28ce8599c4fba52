VIncluding   Carnatic music concerts and fielding senior vidwans could only embellish the festivity of any major event. That&#8217;s  happening  at  the three-week long Delhi International Arts Festival too.  The festival is a celebration  of visual and performing arts, films, literature and food  and  Carnatic music concerts are  included under the Indian  classical  music session.Raghavachari and Seshachari, popularly known as the &#8216;Hyderabad Brothers,&#8217;  presented an enthralling  Carnatic music concert which lasted for about  two hours. Most of the compositions that the duo sang  were those of the legendary  saint Tyagaraja and the two  did an excellent job in bringing out the raga as well as the sahithya bhavas to the fore through the compositions  and improvisation techniques. The opening piece &#8216;Mapala velasi&#8217;, a composition of Tyagaraja in raga Asaveri was very emotive. &#8216;Sitamma mayamma&#8217; in raga Vasantha and &#8216;Bhuvini dasudane&#8217; in  raga Sriranjani (both Tyagaraja&#8217;s compositions) that the singers  presented subsequently made the proceedings lively. Both these pieces were preceded with a brief delineation of the ragas and suffixed with fast tempo swaraprastharas that were indicative of their vidwat in manodharma music.The structure of the concert, selection of compositions and the ragas itself was reflective of their experience in the field of Carnatic music. &#8216;Santhamuleka&#8217;, a slow tempo composition of Tyagaraja in the raga Sama, was again emotive. Earlier, the younger sibling Seshachari presented an excellent alap of this raga. &#8216;Ananda nadamaduvar&#8217;, a  Tamil composition of Neelakanta Sivam in  raga Poorvikalyani and yet another Tyagaraja&#8217;s composition &#8216;Paramathmudu&#8217; in  raga Vagadeeshwari were given fine treatment.As their main item, the duo presented Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Dhyaname varamaina&#8217; in  raga Dhanyasi. The hallmarks were a detailed delineation of the raga by Seshachari, niraval of the phrase &#8216;Tyagaraju telisikonna rama&#8217; and swaraprastharas. Both niraval and swaraprastharas were rich in creativity.The brothers  were ably assisted by M. Surya Deepti on the violin and Kali Prasad Babu on the mridangam. Surya Deepti&#8217;s detailed delineation of  raga Poorvikalyani was excellent and Babu&#8217;s tani avartanam in adi tal was captivating. On the whole, it was an enjoyable evening. Being senior vidwans, the duo should however, desist from referring to their notebooks while singing, which they did almost throughout their concert.In another concert at the  festival, it was the coming together of two generations. Experienced mother Sikkil Neela and enterprising daughter Sikkil Mala (not Neela Sikkil and Mala Sikkil as printed in the festival pamphlets) presented a riveting flute concert in  Carnatic style.The duo began their concert impressively with Purandaradasar&#8217;s &#8216;Gajavadana Beduve&#8217; in  raga Hamswadhani. Their swaraprastharas towards the end was crisp and lively. They brought out the emotive aspects of  raga Karunaranjani out of their instruments while presenting Harikesanallur Muthaiah Bagavadar&#8217;s &#8216;Vanchathoduna&#8217;. After presenting Ramnad Srinivasa Iyengar&#8217;s &#8216;Raghunadha Rama&#8217; in  raga Swararanjani (which is close to the raga Kadanakudukalam), the mother-daughter duo presented their main item of their concert, which was Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Intha sowkiyamu&#8217; in raga Kapi. The flutists , in turns, presented a fine alap of this raga delineating in stages and bringing out the essence of this raga to the fore. The subsequent swaraprastharas rich in creativity flowed melodiously from  their instruments.Nellai Ravindran on the violin, Delhi&#8217;s K.N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam and K. Ramamurthy on the  ghatam provided excellent support, which was acknowledged constantly both by Neela and Mala. Ravindran&#8217;s delineation of the raga Kapi was excellent and the taniavartanam in adi tal was very impressive.
