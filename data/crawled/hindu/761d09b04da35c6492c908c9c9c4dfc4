VThe Gandharva Mahavidyalaya (GMV), Delhi, has a  tradition of organising workshops under the  guidance of reputed musicians and scholars for the  benefit of  students. This time, they invited Pandit Arvind Parikh from Mumbai to conduct a two-day sitar workshop this past weekend. Apart from being a renowned musician, musicologist and an ace sitar player of the Vilayatkhaani baaj, this senior most disciple of the late Ustad Vilayat Khan is among the most revered gurus.  The Patwardhan Naad Mandir at GMV was brimming with the enthusiasm.  Arvind Bhai (as he is popularly known ) interacted with the 30-odd students and  music lovers  and made  the students play individually to gauge their grasping power. He  stressed upon the essential humility and spiritual reverence for sitar, the instrument of their musical expression, before one picks it up to play it.   The instrument should be properly tuned after the practice or performance, and  be kept respectfully in a well braced condition and the dignity of the instrument should always be maintained, he said.He divided the workshop into four segments. The first part dealt with the instrument and the baithak (sitting posture) of holding it, where he explained and showed what should be the angle of the sitar, position of the feet, position and the use of right and left hands, how to wear a mizrab, the mizrab stroke&#8217;s angle, span and source of strength, the tension free mental attitude and even the relaxed  facial expression while playing, as if conversing.The second section was about proper tuning, bracing the instrument and gauge of the strings in view of the changes brought into the physical structure of the sitar by Ustad Vilayat Khan to facilitate the execution of gayaki ang. The important points to be  noted before the students commence  playing were put across in detail. For example, the left index finger should never leave the melody string.  He also reiterated the importance and difference between &#8216;alap ki chikaari&#8217;, &#8216;mohara ki chikaari&#8217; and &#8216;jhala ki chikaari&#8217; and their specific uses, where all three strings have a different timbre. The &#8216;tarab&#8217; strings below the main strings, he explained, are rightly called sympathetic strings. Hence they should just &#8216;sympathise&#8217; with the music and not intrude.
