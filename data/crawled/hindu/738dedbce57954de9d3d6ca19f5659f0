VThe high points that dominated Amrutha Venkatesh&#8217;s recital were two. One was the Mukhari raga alapana and  other the currently often-sung Saveri. However, the treatment Amrutha gave for Mukhari was outstanding as it brought out  the pathos ingrained in the very raga. When Amrutha rendered the alapana she involved herself totally and when she sang the Swati Tirunal kriti &#8216;Bhavati Visvasome&#8217; in a relaxed pace, it touched many a heart. The niraval though short was sweet.The other point was her sober and serene alapana of Saveri. Here too, Amrutha rendered the alapana with complete dedication that she could draw the picture of the raga in every detail. Rightly, the chosen major kriti was &#8216;Srirajagopala&#8217; of Muthusamy Dikshitar that gave her enough scope to sing it in &#8216;vishranti.&#8217; The niraval &#8216;Dheeragraganya Dheera Sareera&#8217; drew the violinist Karaikal Venkatasubramaniam to share his ideas and swaras that followed were lively.Amrutha began with Thodi Varnam &#8216;Era Napai&#8217; of Patnam Subramania Iyer and moved on to the Arabhi piece &#8216;Naadha Sudharasam Pilanu&#8217; with a dazzling display of swaras. Even when she rendered &#8216;Neevada Negana&#8217; in Saranga, she only sang swarakalpanas for the line &#8216;Satyambu Nityambu&#8217; and yet made an impact, without resorting to niraval. Before concluding with a Tamizh viruttam &#8216;Unnai Sindhai Seidhu,&#8217; Amrutha sang a Purandaradasar kriti &#8216;Smarisuva&#8217; in Surutti.Karaikal S. Venkatasubramanian on the violin and K. Ramasubramanian on the mridangam gave splendid support to the recital of Amrutha Venkatesh.It looked as if the &#8216;Mukhari&#8217; raga of the noon concert had its spill over effect in the afternoon performance of Sriram Gangadharan. He sang a neat Mukhari for the Subbaraya Sastri kriti, &#8216;Ema Ninne Ni Mahima Teliya.&#8217; Sriram, perhaps being a devotee of the saint of Mantralaya, invoked his blessings through his sloka &#8216;Poojyaya Raghavendraya,&#8217; to begin with. With a little swaraprasthara, he sang the Bilahari kriti of Muthusamy Dikshitar &#8216;Eka Dantam Bajeham&#8217; before taking up the Mayamalavagowla kriti &#8216;Deva Deva Kalayamithe&#8217; of Swati Tirunal. Sriram has a kind of zest for speed, but was subdued when he sang the niraval line &#8216;Jatarupa Nipachela&#8217; with brief swaraprastaras.Sriram&#8217;s foray into Kalyani revealed his manodharma when he essayed the raga with feeling and here the violinist R. Sathishkumar took from where Sriram ended and gave his version of the alapana which was truly good. The kriti of Tyagaraja, &#8216;Enduko Neemanasu&#8217; was one that was featured next. The fast-paced &#8216;Sarasa Sama Dhana&#8217; in Kapinarayani preceded Sriram&#8217;s RTP. Thodi was the raga chosen for the presentation and Sriram did a fairly good job whereas there were a few slips by violinist, but it did not mar the elegance of the raga. Percussion by Chidambaram S. Balashankar was excellent throughout and specially his &#8216;thani&#8217; twice, one after the swaraprastaras in the Kalyani kriti and again after the RTP. Sriram closed his recital with &#8216;Bruhi Muhundeti&#8217; and &#8216;Varugalamo Ayya.&#8217;
