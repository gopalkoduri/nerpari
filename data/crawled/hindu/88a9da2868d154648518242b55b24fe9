VThe passionate plea of &#8216;Isiayin Varnajalangal&#8217; presented as part of Carnatica&#8217;s Bharat Sangeet Utsav was for music that could wear respectability as its badge. The music  of S.V. Venkatram, S. M. Subbiah Naidu, G. Ramanathan, K.V. Mahadevan, MSV-Ramamurthy combine was showcased by young singers born decades after the maestros had composed the pieces in the B&amp;W era.As Bharath Sundar began &#8216;Sindhanai Sei Maname&#8217; (TMS-Ambigapathi) from its anupallavi, for Saindhavi to dovetail it to &#8216;Mannavan Vandhanadi&#8217; (Suseela-KVM), the mood got defined.  Tiruchi Pradeep Kumar, regular performer on the Carnatic stage, took up &#8216;Ullathil Nalla Ullam&#8217; (Sirkazhi Govindarajan-Karnan), &#8216;Vadhaname&#8217; (MKT-Sivakavi) and &#8216;Thangaradham Vandhadhu&#8217; (Balamurali and Suseela, Kalaikkovil) and the rendering revealed the acumen of Subhashree Thanikachalam, the force behind the show, in the selection of songs and the singers.Suvasini sincerely tried &#8216;Giridhara Gopala&#8217; (MS-Meera) and teamed in a compact manner with Srinidhi to sing &#8216;Androru Naal,&#8217; a number based on the raga Desh. Srinidhi sang &#8216;Yaaradi Nee Mohini&#8217; (Uthama Puthiran) with verve and vigour. Vinaya and Gayathri showed a good grasp of the original as they sang the ragamalika, &#8216;Kaathiruppan Kamalakannan.&#8217; Vinaya also sang &#8216;Aadal Kaaneero,&#8217; an MLV memorable, based on Charukesi.The tail portion included two songs (Adinaryana Rao) in lighter vein, hilarious to be precise &#8212;  Kangalum Kavipaduthe (Adutha Veetuppen) and Neeye Unakku Endrum (Bale Pandiya) based in Sudha Dhanyasi. Viewers, overtaken by nostalgia, smiled as they recollected the scenes.Bharath Sundar&#8217;s creditable solo was &#8216;Madavippon Mayilal&#8217; (Iru Malargal) and Saindavi resurfaced to present some Suseela hits,  &#8216;Maraindhirundhu Paarkum&#8217; (Thillana Mohanambal), being one of them.  Harish Kumar combined with Saindhavi for the lilting number &#8216;Iravum Nilavum&#8217; (Karnan), based on the raga Sudha Sarang. The accompanying orchestra was minimal throughout - a chitra veena, a keyboard, an organ, the guitar and the tabla.Ganesh (chitraveena) made his quick analytical comment on each of the songs rendered. He demonstrated on the instrument what his musical mind had observed about these songs as they came by, composed a pallavi impromptu  reaching the  crescendo in Simhendra Madhyamam (Aadadha Manamum Undo) where he reached out vocally, with ease and poise, to touch the top dhaivatham, carefully preserving its komal swaropam with care.A laudable effort from Subashree, who had  made each of these compositional/lyrical masterpieces accessible to the modern consciousness of these present day singers. She had trained them without robbing the originals of their soul. And therein lay her success.
