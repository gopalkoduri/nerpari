VSujanaranjani, a music sabha of Sanathnagar featured Varanasi Sri Sowmya in their music concert. She is good at expressingbhavawith perfect modulation and clear pronunciation of words. This time she chose about 15 numbers to pres\u000aent on the occasion in a span of two hours. Three of them are Annamayya compositions. One is Rajaji&#8217;sKurumundruvinaiset inRagamalika, another is Purandaradasa&#8217;s popularJagadodharanain Kapi and a Narayana Teertha&#8217;sTarangam, most of them came as end pieces.As for the main chunk of the concert repertoire, her majesticragaThodi stood out as the best in the concert, as no otherragawas treated at length. The choice of Thodi forKaddanuvarikiand its delineation stretching it through the three octaves was indeed a very satisfying experience.Thenerevalpart accentuated the impact of thesahityaof the line,Addampu Chekkillache.Swaraprastharatoo was quite interesting and carried the melodic line through out.Sri Sowmya opened her concert with a briskvarnaminragaVasantha. AndGam Ganapathein Hamsadwani followed. Deekshitar&#8217;sRakshitohamin Suddha Dhayasi,Ghummaniyadi Sritiwas an Annamayya composition and its rendition was also benefited by her briefSwarakalpana. So was Swati Tirunal&#8217;sKrupayapalayain Charukesi.
