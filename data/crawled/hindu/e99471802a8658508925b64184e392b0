VAn informal setting can transform the qawwali experience. And so it was when Warsi brothers Nazeer and Naseer Ahmed Khan performed at the LaMakan in Banjaral Hills. The Warsi brothers were their melodic best with chosen old-time hits like Jisko Moula tere rahamat ka yakeen hota and Aaj akele miljaye tho daaman tham ke ro lunga.. some, from their illustrious grandfather's repertoire. One rubai (quatrain) followed another in voices charged with devotion as the audience soaked in the experience. The entourage on the stage made for a qawwali picture perfect. Absolute sync, rich content and adherence to tradition are the forte of Warsi brothers. The pick up from one singer to another is done with seamless ease that it is hard to locate the singer unless one is a keen viewer. The tone and tenor is uniform within the troupe.
