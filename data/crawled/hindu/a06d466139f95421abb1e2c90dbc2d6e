VM.V.RAMAKRISHNANListening to an excellent vocal recital by P. Unnikrishnan at Hamsadhwani recently, and considering his success as a playback singer in South Indian films also, one was tempted to indulge in an interesting line of thinking.There was a time long ago when most rasikas of Carnatic music had few  sources of entertainment, apart from the occasional shows of cinema and drama, which would often have music with a strong Carnatic base or character. Apart from enjoying Carnatic music frequently in concert halls and temple premises, they would be hearing it constantly on the radio, and repeatedly on the gramophone with a handful of 78-rpm records.Having such intense concentration on our classical music, which rests on a solid religious foundation, the majority of rasikas those days were usually inclined to expect all Carnatic musicians to be orthodox and old-fashioned in their appearance, dress code and lifestyle, and also to be exclusively devoted to Carnatic music.They could never easily approve any inclination of leading Carnatic musicians to perform any other kind of music, or even to diversify their art within the boundaries of Carnatic music. This irrational prejudice continued to prevail far into the 20th century, in spite of the rasikas' own gradually changing lifestyles and growing interest in contemporary film music with little or no Carnatic element.Thus, K.J.Yesudas and T.V.Gopalakrishnan had encountered very unfair resistance in Madras when they began showing their paces as extremely competent Carnatic vocalists in the 1960s.  (Of course, the masters did overcome the resistance with the sheer excellence of their virtuosity).Sacred and profaneBut the whole environment of Carnatic music has changed dramatically since then, and the lifestyles of the music-lovers and musicians alike have become far more dynamic and liberal.Carnatic music is no longer the only  pastime for most rasikas, and they no longer expect the musicians to be  conservative.As a result, a talented and versatile Carnatic vocalist now faces no great resistance if he or she has a parallel career as a playback singer in the films.  On the contrary, the glamour of the cinema connection even makes the musician more popular in Carnatic music circles.  The litmus test of the musician's claim for distinction is how far the authentic spirit of Carnatic music is preserved in a conventional concert, which largely depends on his or her own artistic integrity.Unnikrishnan is  a young vidwan who passes the test with flying colours. Having learnt Carnatic music from several eminent teachers and constantly striving to use his own imagination, he has developed a distinct style of singing which is as charming as it is lively. A hallmark of his art is his extremely fluent style of rendering the swaraprasthara (which flowed colourfully in the raga Bilahari in his recent concert at Hamsadhwani). And one is really impressed by the resolute way in which Unnikrishnan completely filters out the influence of the fizzy film songs he must be singing elsewhere.Bottom Template Starts
