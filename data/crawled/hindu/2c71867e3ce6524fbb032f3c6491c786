VHer repertoire is generally quite wide and traditional and caters to the taste of music lovers. All these traits were found in her concert once again at  Thygaraya Gana Sabha,  under the aegis of Ananda Mahati Cultural Association. On this occasion a CD of her chosen composition was also released by Dr. C. Narayana Reddy. Some compositions from the C.D were also made part of  the concert  in the company of Nemani Somayajulu on mridangam and Ravindra Tejasvi on ghatam. Ananda Rajyalakshmi opened her veena show withNatakuranji varnamthat proved to be a good warming up exercise.  The highlight of the entire concert was theSimhendramadhyamamnumberKamakshi Kamakotiof Deekshitar. The raaga was essayed neatly structuring it methodically into a dignified look. Then she played the inevitableTanam.The Tani Avartanam by percussionists Nemani and Tejasvi was an added attraction. But the latter part was packed with curious items that included a Yenki Paata of Nanduri Subba Rao -Padavelli Potondi, she composed in Hindusthani Pahadi and then a more curious number -NottuSwaram play.
