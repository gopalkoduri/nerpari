VGUDIPOODI SRIHARIKomanduri Venkata Krishna's name is generally associated with violin. But if one listens to his full-fledged vocal concert one is bound to agree that he is perhaps one of the best vocalist among the younger generation artistes. This opportunity was provided by Nadabharati in its fest held at Thyagaraya Gana Sabha. Krishna's concert bore the stamp of a traditionalist and also that of emerging modernity. He displayed a stance of confidence and throw of his voice to its full capacity. He opened his concert withKaanada Ata Tala varnamand then went for Thyagaraja'sPancharatna kirtana - Jagadananda KarakainNata. This broke the violinist image of the artistes and put him before us a very promising vocalist .AfterSaraswati NamostuteinSaraswathi, Krishna essayed a fragrantSahanafor Patnam'sRama Ika Nannnu. He retained in his rendition the natural flavour of theraga. Even this ability to weave theragaline through impressive moves was noticed in the rendition ofPoorvi Kalyani. He rightly chose Syama Sastri'sNinnu Vinaaga. He also marked this rendition with goodnerevaland impressiveswarastructure.Sarasa SamadanainKapi Narayaniserved as a break for the delineation ofBhairavi. Muthuswamy Dikshitar'sBalagopalawas his choice number in this. His skilful rendition ofnerevalandswaraprasthatraestablished him as a vocalist to watch. The voco-violinist is the son of scholar andvoco-violinist Seshadri.Then came theRagam-Tanam-PallaviinBilahari. He did thepallaviin complexKhanda Jathi Triputa Thalam. And he did it well. The beauty lay in its brevity covering all traditional aspects. ARagamalika Slokamgave the finishing touch.Ramaraju Dinakar (violin), Srinivasa Gopalan ( mridangam) and Shyam Kumar ( kanjeera) lent matching support. TheTani avartanamof percussionists was enjoyable.Melodic concertNada Bharathi and Sri Thyagaraya Gana Sabha jointly presented Bhamidipati Lalitha Madhav in a melodious Carnatic vocal music recital at Sri Thyagaraya Gana Sabha , as part of a weeklong festival to commemorate maestros of bygone era. This programme was in memory of Sangeetha Kalanidhi M.S. Subbulakshmi. Lalitha was the student of the late M.S. Balasubrahmanya Sarma. Blessed with good vocal culture, she underwent training at Suguna Purushothaman of Chennai in art of presenting a concert.Lalitha opened withKambhoji Ata Thala varnamof Maharaja Swati Tirunal and went on to singOm Ganapathayein rareSivasakti Raga. Her brief essay ofChandrajyothiwas laudable. She renderedSasivadanain this. Syamasastry'sPahisriinAnandabhairavialso proved a rare choice and she presented it  with melodic lilt.She madePoorvikalyanias one of her main efforts. She presented Dikshitar'sSri Visalakshi, thenerevalandswarammade it an enchanting piece with free flowingswaras. Lalitha appeared to have made it a point to present some rarely heard pieces. TheRudrapriyapiece and the compositionAmbaparadevathein it was one example. TheThodithat she took up later stood out as best melody. And she chose for this another rarekritiofThyagaraja&#151;Karuna Joodavamma. After thenereval, she  presentedswarasin variegated rhythmic patterns.GNB'sMohana KrishnainKadanakutuhalampreceded Lalitha'sRagam, TanamandPallaviinMohana. Thepallaviwas in intricateTisra Rupaka ThalaminMishra Gathi. She presented it in three speeds. Goodswarastructure also marked thePallavi, with a bit ofragachain. Nada Bharati's founder secretary, Srinivasa Gopalan says that he requested all the participants in the festival to renderRagam-Tanam-Pallavi, for the reasons of encouraging the artistes to revive this waning part of a concert. K.V. Krishna on violin and P V Ramana Murthy on mridangam lent good support.Avadharu RaghupatheofAnnamacharyainKhamasand aJayadeva Ashtapadimarked the end part.Bottom Template Starts
