He was tunefully accompanied on violin by B.V. Durga Bhavani along with the pristine laya bhava emanated and sustained well all along on mridangam by M.L.N. Raju and tabla by B.V. Ramanamurty.Suribabu delightfully rendered in the format of traditional carnatic music. From the word go when he started with the compositionVaade Venkatadriin Vasantha, he seemed to be empathetically experiencing the bliss of being in impeccably perfect tune (sruthi and layabhavas) and made the houseful audience also share it equally with him for about two and half hours till he concluded with the Mangalam. His choice for the evening were compositions set to evocatively exquisite music mostly by the renowned musician vocalist Dr. Sripada Pinakapani and a few by Nedunuri Krishnamurty, Rajanikantha Rao, his own guru, the most reputed vocalist Oleti Venkateswarlu and himself.Elaboration ofSakalasantikaramuin Bahudari,Yedi Nijambaniin Saveri with aalapana and swaram,Yithanikante Ghanudika Leduin Navarasakannada, expansive expatiation ofJhummaniyedi sruthi koodaganuin Poorvikalyani, a poem of Taallapaka China Tirumalacharya in Ragamalika,Rammanave Maani Rachanalanu,Maayamohain Jog,Aakativelalain Revathi,Chandamamaravein Behag andHarinamamuin Pahadi besides the opening song filled the air.
