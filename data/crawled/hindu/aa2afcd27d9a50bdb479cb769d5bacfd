VObsessed with pompous display, reflected in punitive overtones to raga sancharas, articulation of sahityas and swaraprastharas the recital of Hyderabad Brothers &#8212; Raghavachari and Seshachari &#8212; in the Sri Krishna Gana Sabha&#8217;s Gokulashtami series required considerable tolerance to come to terms with their status in Carnatic music. The language of emotional enjoyment and the peace of sangita were not their cup of tea. The kutcheri was meant to entertain and amuse, not to illuminate the loftiness of music&#8217;s purpose.The raga alapana by Seshachari in particular was an exercise in just tonal vibrancy and punishing intensity, occasionally relieved by contrived gana-laya passages. Depth and appeal were sought to be evoked by stridency, an increasing trend today, gaining preponderance in the objective of vidwans. The kirtanas of great vaggeyakaras, the spiritual core of their songs represent important value of music, but the way Hyderabad Brothers rendered their selection  made one wonder whether they had grasped the correct perspective.Music, grace or gross, is exemplified by the ideals vidwans hold in view, but a great song in the absence of lofty inspiration can be prosaically ritualistic, as the presentation of &#8220;Maamava-Meenakshi&#8221; (Varali) and &#8220;Dinamani-Vamsa-Tilaka&#8221; (Harikhambodi) by Seshachari and Raghavachari. Swaraprastharas between the Brothers were symmetrically arranged arithmetic. They however helped knowledgeable rasikas to recall heard melodies from earlier era veterans. Their rendition was not such as to make the listeners take the message slowly pausing towards what melodic treat the two great songs had to offer. In every respect their performance truly represented the pulse of the present day kutcheri culture.&#8220;Ninnu-Joochi&#8221; (Sourashtram) and &#8220;Vina-Rada-Naa Manavi&#8221; (Devagandhari) set the tone of the programme to come. The few bars of the two ragas before the kirtanas were fairly melodically decent. It is the elaboration of Varali and Harikambhodi that contained all sanchara rhetoric sans sensitivity. The kutcheri was a grand treat to excitement appetites.M.A. Sundareswaran, the violinist, in his solo session linked the raga images to the satisfaction of the vocalists. It was interesting to see how he transferred to sanchara combinations to the bursting pattern of the main artistes.Srimushnam Raja Rao (mridangam) and Adambakkam Sankar (ghatam) were willing partners in enhancing the musical salesmanship for the success of the performance. The jugglery of the mridangam solkattus was sparkling in the tani executed with verve and technical virtuoso. The ghatam artistes concept was equally enlivening.
