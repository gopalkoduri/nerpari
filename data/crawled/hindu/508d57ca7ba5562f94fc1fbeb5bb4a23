VThe huge stage at the Sir M.V.Rao concert hall was all set with Mishkomba&#8217;s  bass and Yoav Bunzel&#8217;s drums setting out with gay  abandon to synchronise with flute, violin and the sitar leading to Mahesh Vinayakram&#8217;s glorious Heer.The fantasy of the musician while being absolutely  human,  was equally aware of the combined perspective of fusion, classical and world music.In the present scenario the  quality of music is determined by musical resources, their consolidation, technology and social environment.This kind of music is cosmic,  beginning with an awareness of self in the Universe and concluding with an elaborate design for living. It is traditional yet contemporary.The Rain Buddha traditional chant in Mohanam to the accompaniment of Padma Shankar&#8217;s violin, Ravi Shankar&#8217;s sitar, Navin Iyer&#8217;s flute and Zohar Fresco&#8217;s drums was quite amazing. It built up a crescendo that was magical and mystical.With the water-side backdrop came Anuradha&#8217;s &#8216;Enna Tavam Seidhanai,&#8217;  in Kapi. The rendition in Carnatic style to the sound of morsing alternated by sitar and violin, and Mahesh&#8217;s sargams and alaps, supported by the percussion instruments, was quite a musical statement.The music from Israel and Turkey weaved tales from distant lands and blended it with the earthy music of the Sufi singers of Nagoor, in  Tamil Nadu and also kept pace with the dance of Sangeetha Ghose and Chisato Ohno.Strengthening the classical tradition, Madhukons and Bhimplas were played to the beat of the drums.The audience, familiar to the loud beat, punctuated with musical interludes of the intoxicating music swallowed every bit of it.What essentially began as an attempt to relieve people from the memory of  the Tsunami,  has grown into an annual Laya Project, a dream project of Sonya Mazumdar and Yotam Agam. The  ensemble has come to stay.
