VAs  acoustic guitars are  rare on concert platforms, the concert by the teachers of music from  Berne University  hogged much publicity.A score of compositions were played in the 90-minute  recital that   began  with the Second movement for the concert of two guitars and orchestra in G major by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi. Vivaldi had written this piece &#8216;De la pieta&#8217; for a church in Venice.  The piece, with Rutscho on the lead and Dauwalder on the rhythm, was inexorably soft. The accompaniment was remarkable for the progression of chords.The next choice was Fernado Sor of the classical period who himself was an accomplished guitarist and composer.   His father had sent him to Italy for military training; but there he fell in love with music and turned a composer and performer. The musicians chose the number &#8216;Fantasie op. 54.&#8217;&#8216;Valses poeticos,&#8217; composed by  Spanish composer Enrique Granados of the Romantic Period, was the next number. The composition appeared very poetical as the tempo gradually increased. The short composition was specially noted for the remarkable movements of the lead guitar.The guitarists once again reverted to the Classical period and selected the famous work &#8216;Fandango&#8217; in D minor of the Italian composer Luigi Boccherini. A brilliant cellist, he had originally written the composition for a string quintet. What made the accompaniment remarkable was the way Dauwalder filled the gaps  with notes on the bass strings.Next came two pieces &#8211; &#8216;Milonga Shakesperes&#8217; and &#8216;Primavera portena&#8217; &#8211; by  Argentine composer Astor Piazzolla.  He had his higher training in France where he evolved his own style of Tango music that was christened &#8216;Nuevo Tango.&#8217;They played three more of his compositions.  Compositions by Jorge Cardose (Spanish), Maxima Diego Pujol (Argentine), Giuseppe Farrauto (Italian) and Erik Marchelie (Brazilian), all who belonged to the modern period, were also played. The concert, organised by  Navaneetham Cultural Trust, was held at Jawahar Bala Bhavan, Thrissur.
