VSri Rama Lalitha Kala Mandira, Bangalore, presented Sanjay Subramanyan in concert on Sunday, accompanied by Nagai Muralidharan (violin), Neyveli B. Venkatesh (mridanga) and Trichi K. Murali (ghata), as part of its Spring Music Festival in Bangalore.&#8220;Sarasijanabha&#8221;, the ata taala varna in Kamboji was succeeded by the Dikshithar krithi in Kamalamanohari, &#8220;Kanjadalayathakshi&#8221;. Andolika, elaborated with fast passages and flourishes that also occasionally incorporated the gliding descent so characteristic of the raga, highlighted the artiste&#8217;s virtuosity rather than the gentle lilt inherent in the raga and in the composition, Ragasudharasa. The ensuing kalpana swaras were notable for the focus on the different shades of the nishada in the lower speed.&#8220;Arivaar Yaar Unnai&#8221; in Mukhari raga and misra chapu tala was succeeded by an expansive alapana of Kalyani and a brisk &#8220;Sive Pahimam&#8221;, neraval, kalpana swaras, and a crisp tani avarthana. Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Evvare Ramayya&#8221; in the vivadi melakartha raga Gangeyabhushani, and &#8220;Padavendume&#8221; in Hamsanadam raga, were bhava-laden renditions.Unfettered manodharma was manifest in the alapana of Keeravani, especially in the tara sthayi sancharas that emphasised the gandhara, in the raga tana pallavi ensemble. The tana featured a multiplicity of weighty combinations, and the pallavi &#8220;Govinda Alarmelmangaimanala&#8221; set to khanda jathi triputa tala, the requisite variations in tempo and gati. The ragamalika swaras culminated in Darbari Kanada, telescoping into an immediate rendition of &#8220;Govardhana Giridhara&#8221;.While the artiste&#8217;s formidable improvisational skills and technical mastery, articulated in highly individualistic and animated manner enthused the capacity crowd, a corresponding stress on a tranquil and reposeful effect would also have been welcome.Senior vocalist Neela Ramgopal&#8217;s concert on Monday was part of the same ongoing series. She was accompanied by V.V. Ravi (violin), Neyveli Narayanan (mridanga), and S. Karthik (ghata).Commencing with &#8220;Vanajaksha&#8221;, the ata tala varna in Reethigowla, the artiste presented &#8220;Samayamide&#8221;, the Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer krithi in Kedaram, embellished with vibrant kalpana swaras, and Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Karubaru Seyuvaru&#8221; in Mukhari, which imparted a quality of sombre classicism to the recital. &#8220;Kayarohanesam&#8221;, the Dikshitar krithi in Devagandharam raga and rupaka tala was preceded by an enchanting alapana suffused with a sweetness that was sustained in the kalpana swaras as well, and was followed by a deft alapana of Gangeyabhushani and &#8220;Sulabha Pujeyamadi&#8221; in khanda chapu tala.The beautiful alapana of Shanmukhapriya illumined the myriad facets of the raga, and prefaced Swathi Tirunal&#8217;s &#8220;Mamava Karunaya&#8221; in mishra chapu thala, rendered in a perfect kalapramana and incorporating a complete neraval at the anupallavi line &#8220;Kamithadanalola&#8217;, and kalpana swaras in two speeds, replete with rhythmic patterns. The tani avarthana that followed completed the most impressive item of the concert.The raga tana pallavi in Bageshri, which included a detailed alapana and tana and a pallavi beginning &#8220;Somasundareswarapriya Vamabhagasri Rajamathangi&#8221; set to mishra jathi triputa thala, was rendered with the mandatory technical components that imbued the exercise with a heavy classical flavour, and concluded with ragamalika swaras. The solo improvisations of the violinist who reflected the tenor of the vocalist and the unstinted support of the percussionists augmented the impact of the concert.
