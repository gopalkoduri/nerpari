VKirubayin GeethangalGrace ChellakumarSmall Steps (Rs. 65)Grace Chellakumar has brought out an album of ten of her compositions under the title, `Kirubayin Geethangal' as part of volume 1 entitled, "Yesuvin Maa Anbu."The singer -  composer had been down with cancer seven years ago and had been through the path of suffering.  But the Lord Jesus in His mercy healed and restored her to good health. Hence she wanted to sing and praise His name.Chellakumar wrote the lyrics of the nine songs found in the album and also set tune to them.  Kennedy Edwin has done the background music for the numbers and has rendered "Ratchanya Kombae" with feeling. He has sequenced the songs on a keyboard. Though the background score is simple and limited, it is pleasant on the ear, though one wished he had taken care to avoid the monotony in the rhythm.Chellakumar's very first song "Naan yenna seithaen yendru" makes clear the heartcry of the devotee.  The sale proceeds of the CD go to needy cancer patients. For details, contact Phone: 26208888/8989.SELINE AUGUSTINEBottom Template Starts
