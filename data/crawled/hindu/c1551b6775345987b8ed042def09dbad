VIt worked because the artistes stayed true to their instincts and discipline even in untested waters.Drawing from the melodies of film composers ranging from Papanasam Sivan to A. R. Rehman rendered by a galaxy of singers including M.L.Vasanthakumari, M.S.Subbulakshmi, T.M.Soundararajan, S.P.Balasubramaniam, Chitra and Unnikrishnan, the numbers had one thing in common &#8212; they were all based on classical ragas.With &#8216;Giridhara Gopala&#8217; (Mohanam) carrying a sprinkling of kalpanaswaras and &#8216;Maa Ramanan&#8217; (Hindolam) replete with alapana, niraval and swaras, the feel of a kutcheri was never far, reminding you that things have come full circle with today&#8217;s young artistes bridging the gap between film and classical music. In &#8216;Aadaadha Manamum Undo&#8217; (Lathangi) you marvelled anew at the marriage of melody and lyric.&#8216;Maraindirindhu Paarkkum&#8217; (Shanmukhapriya) was not an easy choice and Subiksha scored with her rendition, as in &#8216;Uyirum Neeye&#8217; (Khamas). Pradeep&#8217;s imaginative touches added colour to the sangatis of a Darbari Kanada-based number and &#8216;Ennavale.&#8217; Karaikkal Venkatasubramanian (violin), Shyam Benjamin (keyboard) and Venkat (tabla) shadowed voice with subtle accentuation. The minimal use of orchestration and choice of songs in combination with well-trained voices and clear diction kept the spotlight on the compositions.Purists were in for a treat with this one. Amrutha Venkatesh and Aishwarya Vidya Raghunath, strove to provide a glimpse into the range and depth of the grand composers of the Mysore tradition. Most compositions were enlivened by chittaswaram. With strong styles grounded in uncompromising classicism and a marked affinity for bhava, they cruised through &#8217;Sri Kamakoti Peetasthithe&#8217; (Saveri, Mysore Sadasiva Rao), &#8217;Shankari Sadaananda Lahiri&#8217; (Malavi, Jayachamaraja Wodeyar) and a vibrant thillana (Senchurutti, Veena Seshanna) captivating and moving in turns.Present in &#8216;Narayana&#8217; (Suddha Dhanyasi) was the solidity of patanthara-grounded sangathis. Awaiting discovery but not adequately mined were the soul-melting moments of lyricism inherent in the line &#8216;Krishna Krishna.&#8217; Natakapriya does not find too many takers, but Aishwarya came up trumps in the alapana preceding &#8216;Ithi Samayamu&#8217; (Mysore Vasudevachar), in which the niraval and swaras were a shared effort underscored by excellent rapport. Amrutha&#8217;s Ranjani raga yielded a bounty of powerful akara passages, followed by &#8216;Sadaa Saaranga Nayane&#8217; (Yoga Narasimham). Karaikkal Venkatasubramaniam (violin) came up with appreciable sketches of Ranjani and Natakapriya.Amritha Murali and Nisha Rajagopal exuded an energy in sync with the fiery spirit of the freedom struggle. &#8216;Jayathi Jayathi&#8217; (Khamas, Mayuram Vishwanatha Shastri) with flowing niraval passages struck a fervent patriotic note. Nisha&#8217;s chaste Poorvikalyani alapana complemented Suddhananda Bharathi&#8217;s &#8216;Jhankara Shruthi.&#8217;Amritha&#8217;s Bhairavi emphasised upper octave sancharas and opted for unhurried madhyama kala passages that kept well-rounded gamakas intact, echoed in &#8216;Thondru Nigazhndha.&#8217; The RTP in Kapi came as a breath of fresh air. Nisha&#8217;s initial suite in the alapana backed by purpose and direction, Amritha&#8217;s lovely touches in the freewheeling sancharas above the tara sthayi shadja and the crisp tanam by both vocalists established raga identity with serious intent. The aptly unearthed pallavi &#8216;Swadesha Varam Thandaruliya Raattinamey, Vazhga Vazhgave&#8217; with ragamalika kalpanaswaras deserves special mention.But it was the poignancy of Bankim Chandra&#8217;s &#8216;Vande Mataram&#8217; that lingered long after the last notes had faded. L. Ramakrishnan (violin) impressed with sweetness of tone and a knack for capturing the right phrase. Arjun Ganesh (mridangam) who accompanied both sets of vocalists added hold with forceful sollus and successfully pulled off a mini tani. K.V.Gopalakrishnan accompanied the duo on the kanjira.The mood changed and emotional intensity of a different kind surfaced in Sikkil Mala Chandrashekar and Savitha Narasimhan&#8217;s prayerful offering of compositions on Lord Krishna. Never an easy task to pull off, this voice-instrument duet in which both were equal players, had the artistes working hard to overcome obstacles of pitch and vagaries of tone to achieve a harmonious blend.Khamas was the flavour of the evening and Savitha&#8217;s invocatory verse &#8216;Vasudevasutham&#8217; triggered ever-widening ripples of melody sustained by a subtly-nuanced &#8216;Neela Malar&#8217; (Vasantha, Oothukkadu Venkatasubbaiyyar) which yielded moments of quiet beauty. Kalpanaswaras flowed with natural grace and apt poruttams. Savitha&#8217;s Khambodi shone with traditional pidis and the padam &#8216;Bala Vinave&#8217; was an unusual choice, though a tad slower than expected.The high point came with the ragamalika bhajan &#8216;Jagte Moi&#8217; strung with Hindustani ragas and the lilting viruttam &#8216;Gopala Ratnam&#8217; (Yamuna Kalyani) preceding &#8216;Krishna Nee Begana&#8217; into which voice and flute, alternating seamlessly, wove twilight magic.The versatile Amrutha Murali doubled as violinist in this segment and her deft fingers coaxing melody from strings along with J. Balaji&#8217;s firm strokes on the mridangam made them ideal accompanists.The walk-in concerts signified a brave, new step in the right direction. An innovative concept that worked because the innovation lay within the framework of tradition and was backed by each team&#8217;s determination to make it work. It worked because the artistes stayed true to their instincts and discipline even in untested waters, listeners were cushioned securely in the comfort of undiluted classicism and the pairing of talented young artistes inspired them to discover a golden mean occasioned by a definite theme and the distinctive flavour it evoked.The excellent synchronisation spoke of intensive joint practice sessions and the tremendous groundwork that a first-time collaboration calls for.One aspect that needed streamlining was the timing. With four successive one-hour slots scheduled and a slight delay in beginning the next theme being inevitable with change of artistes, the accumulated delay impacted the final slot that overshot the 9 p.m. limit, which is the lakshman-rekha for most Chennai rasikas.
