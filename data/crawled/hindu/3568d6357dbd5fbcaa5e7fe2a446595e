VMALATHI RANGARAJANThe most rewarding feature of the recent `Rare Evening of Golden Melodies,' organised by Abbas/Prabhat was, it brought to the fore the talents of cine musicians, who have more often than not remained unsung heroes. The trend that began just a few months ago has caught on. In keeping with this shift in focus, `Tabla' Prasad, M. Kalyan, the man with a `singing violin' as M. S. Viswanathan called him, and the inimitable trumpeter, Thomas, were projected as the highlights of the show &#151;  Ganesh Kripa's `Paadaatha Paatellaam.' The significant names among the singers were S. P. Shailaja, `Kovai' Murali and Ananthu. And doing ample justice to their presence on stage was the orchestra, and a very competent chorus group.Nagaratnam, with his assortment of unusual percussion sets, was a treat to watch. And equally enjoyable was the flautist's support. Senthil, Radio Mirchi's RJ, emceed the event.ZestfulFifty-five years as a musician in the film industry and more than 55,000 songs, and still as zestful as ever was `Tabla' Prasad. "Music does that to me," said Prasad, after you saw his fingers dancing on the tabla with glee, for the evergreen Rajinikanth number from `Thillu Mullu,' (`Raagangal Padhinaaru ... ') impressively sung by Ananthu. Also Ananthu's improvisation for the `Simla Special' song, `Unakkenna Maelae ... ' was an example of the singer's potential.S. P. Shailaja's choice and voice were as scintillating as always. Why is she so rarely heard in cinema these days?`Kovai' Murali as usual made a near-perfect replacement for T. M. Soundararajan as he soulfully sang some of the veteran's hits. The popular `Chiththi' song is becoming Saindhavi's trademark.  But surprisingly, she did miss a cue in a couple of places. Talent is in abundance these days &#151;  Anusha's rendition of the ghazal-like `Maegamae' was an example. M. Kalyan, known for his solos in many a film song and re-recording, came out with excellent pieces as his violin `sang' a couple of solos such as the beautiful MSV-Ilaiyaraja composition from `Mella Thirandhadhu Kadhavu.'`Trumpet' Thomas' adeptness on the imposing instrument was a pleasurable experience. The icing came with the fusion of the tabla, violin and trumpet.Bottom Template Starts
