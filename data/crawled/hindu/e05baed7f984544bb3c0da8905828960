VRagapriya, the chamber of music club, introduced one more worthy singer to the Carnatic rasikas of Madurai at a recent concert.Swarna Rethas, a disciple of Sanjay Subramaniam, began his concert with an accurate and sonorous rendering of the varnam, &#8216;Karunimpa&#8217; in Sahana.This was followed by the Sanskrit lyrics of Swati Thirunal, &#8216;Jaya Jaya Padmanabha&#8217; in Manirangu.Undeterred by occasional coughs, the singer presented  an alapana in Andolika as a prelude to Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Raga Sudha Rasa.&#8217;He was fairly successful in evoking the mood of the raga when he sang at a medium tempo while he had to make an effort to replicate the effect at a higher speed.He brought out the unique beauty of Kalyani through just a few phrases in the elaborate alapana to Dikshithar&#8217;s &#8216;Bhajare Re Chitha&#8217; in Misrachapu.It was a painstaking effort showing much promise.Melody is his forte! Be it the alapana to the Ragam, Thanam, Pallavi in Malayamarutham or Gopalakrishna Bharathi&#8217;s &#8216;Enneramum&#8217; or the Purandaradasa kriti, &#8216;Nanda Tanaya Govinda&#8217; in Bhimplas, the range and richness of his voice aided him in bringing out the nuances of the raga.The audience were surprised when he began the RTP  at a later stage of the concert.They, nevertheless, enjoyed and appreciated the pallavi that was sung in Malayamarutham, Amrithavarshini and Ranjani.The light and lively rendering of Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Ramanai Bajithal&#8217; in Mand reminded the listeners of film songs of early Tamil cinema.
