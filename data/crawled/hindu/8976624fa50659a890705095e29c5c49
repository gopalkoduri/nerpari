VBut her statement was proved wrong recently in Varanasi.  Showing that at least listeners of this musically old city are   ready to  take in an elaborate alap, even today.First, Ustad Rahim Fahimuddin Dagar  sang a raga in a Dhrupad concert, introducing it with an alap of one hour and fifteen minutes.Two other significant music events happened when the artistes of India got together to celebrate the 85th birthday of the tabla maestro Pandit Kishan Maharaj here.  Sitar exponent Shujaat Khan played an hour-long alap  of Yaman Kalyan.Alap is a generic term.  It is actually a prayer  through which an artiste  establishes the image of the raga.  The musical ideas are elaborated with the focus on melody and not rhythm.  .After Shujaat, Pandit Rajan and Sajan Mishra  sang raga Miyan ki Malhar with an alap of 45 minutes. Listeners of every stream relished the elaborate alap of Shujaat,   as also Rajan and Sajan&#8217;s performance.  Sandip Das was on the tabla  with Shujaat, while  Kumar Bose from Kolkata accompanied Rajan and Sajan Mishra.Bose said, &#8220;Alap is the only way  one can depict the true profundity of a raga. To shorten a raga means to prepare  tasteless fast food out of it. His point gained further weight when Purbayan  Chatterjee  from Kolkata  played an alap of almost half an hour on his sitar, and an audience dominated by schoolchildren listened with wrapt attention. In short, to quote noted Banaras Hindu University musicologist Lipika Dasgupta, Khayal music divested of an elaborate alap no longer qualifies as a Khayal composition. It becomes &#8216;geya gaan&#8217; or geet. To correctly reveal the image of a raga in the Khayal genre, it is essential to perform a reposed and elaborate alap &#8212; one that reflectschain, the quality of blissful peace in which the identity of the singer, the instruments and the music merge seamlessly.
