VTHE RAIN of Carnatic music in Delhi continued to lash even at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, in the form of a delightful Nadaswaram recital of Sheik Mahaboob Subhani and Kaleeshabi Mahaboob (from Srirangam, Tamil Nadu). The concert organised by the Rashtrapati Bhavan recently as part of its Indra Dhanush series, though lasting for an hour only, was well structured.The couple began their recital with Dikshitar's "Vathapi Ganapathim" in the raga Hamsadhwani, after which they went on to play "Yentharo Mahanubhavulu", the fifth pancharatna kriti of Thyagaraja, in the raga Sri. The beautiful bhava of this raga flowed in abundance and despite this being played on an instrument, rasikas, who were cosmopolitan in nature and included President Abdul Kalam too, seemed to enjoy every bit of the composition. Purandardasa's"Jagadoddharana" in the raga Kapi was emotional. Earlier, Kaleeshabi Mahaboob presented a fine alapana of the raga, bringing out the nuances of this raga. The couple then presented Subramanya Bharathi's "Theerada Vilaiyattu Pillai" in ragamalika and ended their recital with the popular song "Kurai Vondrum Illai".Excellent accompanimentThiruvanaikaval T.V. Muthukumar and Srirangam C.M. Shankar provided excellent accompaniment on the thavil with a good understanding of the compositions, enhancing the overall quality of the concert.Indra Dhanush, a series of cultural events, has been continuing in the Rashtrapati Bhavan as a tribute to the rich performing art heritage of India since December 2002. Some of the other prominent Carnatic musicians who have performed in this series include U. Srinivas, U. Rajesh and L. Subramanian with Kavita Krishnamurthy.Bottom Template Starts
