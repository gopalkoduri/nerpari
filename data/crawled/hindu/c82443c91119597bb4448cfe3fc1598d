VFor hundreds of Rafi buffs in Vijayawada, Saturday had rich musical fare as the city-based Mayur Orchestra belted out his popular songs in a programme, &#8216;Yaad-e-Rafi' organised in commemoration of the legendary singer's 30th death anniversary at Gokaraju Laila Ganga Raju Kala Vedika at Government Music College.The three-hour-long musical journey into the past turned out to be a memorable one for the audience. A brief introduction about Rafi was followed by rendition of his solo hits by the orchestra organiser Mohammad Khaja. He sang songs like O Duniya Ke Rakhwale, Aaja Aaja Mein Hoon Pyaar Ter a, Aaj Mausam Bada Beimaan Hai and Yeh Desh Hai Veer Jawanonko.Along with Sravya and Kamala he also rendered a couple of duets. Paadutha Theeyaga winner Rasool sang Telugu songs rendered by Rafi. Naa Madi Ninnu Pilichindhi and Gopala Bala Ninne Kori were well received by a section of audience who were keen to listen to the Telugu numbers.The organisers felicitated two senior artistes for their contribution to music. The popular song Bane Chahe Dushman from Dostana was rendered to highlight the mutual respect both Rafi and Kishore Kumar had for each other. John Babu (Jani), who used be the voice of Mohammad Rafi in the 70s, received a citation amidst thunderous applause. Shukoor Bhai, well into his sixties, took the audience by surprise by rendering Madhuban mein Radhika from Kohinoor. Rehman and Hanuman Gupta too pitched in to play their tributes to the legendary singers.The instrumentalists led by Hyderabad's Sartaj and Sunil played the interludes to near perfection. The others were Chitti (tabla), Shyam (guitar), Ramana (pads), Danam (drums) and Madhu (congo drums).
