VSushira V. Deshikachar\u000aAcademy of\u000aMusic had arranged\u000aa vocal concert\u000aby R.A. Rama Mani.\u000aV. Nalina Mohan (violin),\u000aB. Ravishankar\u000a(mridanga) and M.R.\u000aManjunath (ghata) accompanied\u000aher in Mysore\u000alast week.The concert that began\u000aon a low-key gained\u000anoticeable momentum\u000aonly in the second half\u000aof the concert.In fact, it was a striking\u000acontrast between\u000athe two stages. Take for\u000aexample, the beginning\u000athree krithis presented\u000ain series - "Sidhivinayakam\u000aAnisham" (Shanmukhapriya - Muthuswamy Dikshitar),\u000a"Makelara Vicharamu"\u000a(Ravichandrika - Tyagaraja) and "Janaki\u000aRamana" (Shudhasimanthini - Tyagaraja).\u000aThey failed to create interest,\u000aas the artiste\u000acould not achieve satisfactory\u000astability (for example,\u000ashruthi) or\u000aexhibit versatility in either\u000aalapana or the neraval\u000aor swaraprastara\u000asections.The senior artiste\u000astarted showing definite\u000asigns of competence and\u000afervour from "Ranganayakam"\u000a(Naayaki-Muthuswamy Dikshitar)\u000aonwards. Alapana in\u000aNaayaki heralded a major\u000abreakthrough materialising\u000ainto maturity\u000ain "Evarimaata" (Kamboji - Tyagaraja). Alapana\u000ain Kamboji\u000acomprised scholarly and\u000aintricate sancharas,\u000aclearly establishing the\u000aartiste as having profound\u000aimagination and\u000acompetence. She reached\u000athe taara sthayi\u000apanchama quite remarkably,\u000amaintaining\u000athe purity of swaras,\u000awhich helped realising\u000athe raagabhaava instantaneously:\u000anow, her manodharma\u000ablooming\u000ainto its full form.A neraval at "Bhakthaparadhinudanuchu"\u000ashone with the full import\u000aof the text, and\u000amore so, the swaraprastara\u000atoo did ample justice\u000ato the composition -\u000ait was a continuation of\u000athe tenor of the lyrics. In\u000athe above areas, the inspired\u000amelody accompanist\u000aadded her own\u000aimagination to complete\u000athe experience.The rhythm-accompanists\u000aprovided the\u000aneeded stability, and\u000atheir artistry reached\u000agreater heights in the tani\u000aavarthana.\u000aOther highlights "Annapurne\u000aVishalakshi"\u000a(Saama-Muthuswamy\u000aDikshitar), "Devarakandha\u000aMukunda"\u000a(Kanthamani-Purandaradasa),\u000a"Vandeham\u000aShive" (Kadanakuthuhala\u000a- Jayachamaraja\u000aWadiyar) and so on.Nadabrahma Sangeetha\u000aSabha held Nadakishorotsava,\u000afive-day\u000amusic competitions exclusively\u000afor the young\u000aartistes. Padmashri N.\u000aRao sang along with accompanied\u000aby two more\u000ayoung artistes, Aditi\u000aKrishnaprasad (violin)\u000aand Vadiraj (mridanga).\u000aHer voice is pleasing\u000aand emotive, and diction\u000aclear. "Odibarayya\u000aVaikuntapathi" (Bhairavi\u000aPurandaradasa) substantiated\u000athe above\u000amerits.An elaborate alapana\u000astrengthened by fine\u000agraces delicately exposed\u000aspecific areas\u000acharacteristic of the raga.\u000aNevertheless, the\u000asancharas ran short of\u000apolished intonations,\u000aand on considering the\u000aneraval and swaraprastara\u000asections, it was evident\u000athat her extempore\u000aneeded more attention.\u000aSome of the other highlights\u000awere "Saamagana\u000aLole" (Hindola- GNB)\u000aTillana (Purnachandrike\u000a- Mysoru Chandrashekharayya)\u000aand so\u000aon.On the same occasion,\u000aSayi Tejas sang accompanied\u000aby the above-mentioned\u000aaccompanists. His\u000aforte was the sense of\u000ashruthi from which he\u000anever deflected, though\u000athere were times when he\u000alost track of the swaras\u000a(alapana in Shankarabharana\u000a- "Pogadirelo Ranga"\u000a- Purandaradasa). The artiste\u000aenriched the sentiments\u000aimpregnated in\u000alyrics, by opting for a majestic\u000atempo facilitating\u000aemotive vocal inflections,\u000aindispensable for expressive\u000amovements.Daru ("Mathe Malayadhwaja"\u000a- Muthayya\u000aBhagavathar), "Pranamamyaham"\u000a(Goula - Mysooru\u000aVasudevacharya),\u000aParipahimam (Rithigaula\u000a- Swathy Thirunal) and a\u000aJaavali (Faraz) gave an\u000aimpression that the artiste\u000awas more sprightly\u000aand dynamic than pleasing\u000aand contemplative.
