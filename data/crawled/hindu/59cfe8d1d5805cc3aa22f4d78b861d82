VDrawing the rasika&#8217;s attention was the imposing photograph of S. Balachander in one corner of the dais decorated with  fresh jasmine.  Thoughts went  back to the many concerts the genius had performed at the same venue.Always a dual feast awaited you, at Balachander&#8217;s concerts &#8212; an authentic aural treat that bore his stamp and a visual treat as you watched his unique mannerisms, his wiping the strings time and again with chamois leather, the regular use of the word &#8216;Andavane&#8217; in his exclamations,  the way he guzzled the Fanta in one long gulp in the course of the concert and his pensive look at the ceiling now and then before he embarked on a &#8220;difficult pidi&#8221; with a smile, the list is endless.Pulling you back to the present was Srinivasan who  finished &#8216;Siddhi Vinayagam&#8217; (Shanmukhapriya-Rupkam-Dikshitar) with a brief swaraprastara. Next was a detailed delineation of Khambodi.Time and again his electronic sruti box played truant and efforts of S.B.S.Raman (son of SB) did not improve things when finally Ananthu who was to play next, lent his sruti box. The grandeur of the raga was maintained throughout with rakti phrases. The minor slips did not matter for Srinivasan&#8217;s is a robust playing style.He capped it with the emotionally moving kriti &#8220;Tiruvadi Charanam&#8221; (Gopalakrishna Bharati). It was a neat presentation with niraval and swarams at &#8220;Aduthu vandhennai.&#8221; The one-hour concert came to an end with Muddukrishnan (Chenchurutti-Adi-Oothukkadu).The next was the veena concert of N. Ananthanarayanan of Kalakshetra. A few phrases of Chakravaham (Gajananayutam -Adi-- Dikshitar) revealed his serious pursuit for the evening. A carefully etched Begada with sweet phrases was a treat to the ears. His soft landing on the shadjamam or the panchamam at the end of some of the phrases was pleasing and put you in a soporific mood. A perfect ten for the execution of Nadaopasana (Adi, Tyagaraja ).Rightly Ananthu did not play any swaras. The Dharmavathi raga alapana was preceded by &#8216;Ora Joopu Joochedi&#8217; (Kannadgowla- Adi-Tyagaraja).The cascading phrases were a purist&#8217;s joy. However, the tanam could have been a trifle slower.&#8216;Bhajana Seya&#8217; ( Rupkam-Mysore Vasudevachar) was laced with swara phrases keeping the raga intact. Ananthanarayanan wound up the proceedings with a brilliant but brief Suratti and a Tiruppugazh.Rhythmic support of Thanjavur Subramaniam and S. Karthik enchanced the concerts&#8217; value.Special mention should be made of their very soft sollus and simple but captivating arudis.
