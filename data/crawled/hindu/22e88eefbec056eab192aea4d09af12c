VThough vibrant and exuberant at times, pleasing tones marked the playing and dancing of an evening of music and dance presented by Pandit Ajay Pohankar, Abhijit Pohankar and party and dancers from the Stem Dance Kampni led by Madhu Nataraj Heri respe\u000actively. It was a compatible marriage between music and dance. The programme was held at the Jnana Jyothi auditorium, Central College, under the aegis of CI Foundation. The Foundation is attempting to attract the youth by presenting traditional art and culture in contemporary styles and holding workshops, interactions and benefit programmes. The proceeds of are shared with charitable organisations.Strictly speaking, the evening belonged to the Pohankars. While the older Pohankar was true to his reputation as an evocative thumri singer, the younger one excelled not only with his lead but also on his key board.The dancers led by Madhu Nataraj performed with conviction more strongly accentuated by the dynamics of the body contributing tautness to their interpretations. They were in perfect sync with the music and with themselves while performing in groups. The leaps, jumps, alignments-realignments, the fluidity of their angikas et al left the viewers spellbound. Adding to all this was, though a questionable point, highly sophisticated lighting and smoke effect creating a world of colour and fantasy. The audience instantly warmed to the visual impact of the bending and twisting bodies of the dancers and the colourful garment and the general air of being tuned to concert pitch.The sweeps of melody seemed to suit  the orchestra better and there were some good moments. The total involvement of the orchestra comprising key board by Abhijit Pohankar, drums by Adhur Sony, guitar by Bintu Singh, saxophone and bansuri by Raj Singh and tabla and other effects by Amith Chowbe, which seemed to understand the genre of the music presented perfectly, resulted in clean playing and expressive dynamics and altogether a good performance.First, Pandit Ajoy Pohankar and later joined by Arathi Ankalikar, sang judiciously selected bandishes and thumri with well balanced parts, the attacks and endings were cleanly executed, the trills precise and the tone clear and pleasing. The enjoyment of the performers was infectious and established a rapport with the rasikas.Panditji sang the numbers with all the Hindusthani paraphernalia like alap, bol baant, taan, bol-taan, sargam et al. Thus the rendition of &#8220;Payaliya jhankar more&#8221;, &#8220;Piya mose bol&#8221;, &#8220;Tum more&#8221; (based on rag Adana, with alap and sargams by Ajoy), &#8220;Naina more taras gaye&#8221;, an overture in raga Keeravani among others were the significant landmarks of the concert. Arathi&#8217;s rich voice came in handy in expressing the moods of the lyrics.The dancers grace and geometry were the key words of the graphic presentation of Yugma. Needless to say, Madhu&#8217;s abhinaya was of a high order. &#8220;Ecstacy&#8221; had nothing special to impart.M. SURYA PRASADBottom Template Starts
