VSri Chandrashekarendra Sangeetha Educational Society, a noted cultural organisation from Secunderabad organised a vocal recital at Keyes High School by master Abhishek Raghuram on the occasion of of Sri Kanchi Paramacharya Jayanthi. Abhishek, a child prodigy is the grand son of mridangam maestro Palghat Raghuraman .This young boy is the disciple of P.S. Narayana Swamy. He is also a good mridangam player and a kanjeera artiste. He has a majestic voice which is well balanced in the lower and higher octaves. The birka sangathis and the laya precision is his strength .On the day, he was accompanied by experienced violinist Vittal Ram Murthy and on the mridangam by Nayveli Narayanan and Shyam on the kanjeera.Abhishek began his concert with Thodi varnam Eranapai which was a perfect start to the concert. The varnam was proportionately rendered with a punch. A soothing alaap of Atana was the next item for Thyagaraja's Balakanaka mayachela with impressive neraval at ra ra devadideva. The kalpanaswaram witnessed good sarvalaghu patterns. Hymavathi was detailed for an alaap. The major attraction was Sankarabharanam. The vocalist showed great maturity in attempting the raga and sung it in vistaram with elegant gamakas. Akshayalinaga vibho in Misrachapu was the kriti in which the neraval at Badari was a treat to watch. The violinist did very well with his alert accompaniment. Narayanan's mridangam support was the highlight. His anticipation and kriti following was professional and his tani in Misrachapu along with Shyam on kanjeera was of high quality. Finally Abhishek concluded with a melodious Revati for Annamayya's Akativelala with good aesthetics. But for the poor acoustics, the whole the concert was appealing and a tribute to Kanchi Paramacharya.
