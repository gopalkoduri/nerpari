VShri Krishna Seva Samiti\u000aCharitable Trust in Mysore,\u000ahad arranged\u000aChandan Kumar's flute\u000arecital as part of Shrikrishna\u000aJanmashtami Celebrations\u000aat Alvar Kalamandira. H.K.\u000aNarasimha Murthy (violin),\u000aB. Ravishankar (mridanga)\u000aand V.S. Ramesh (ghata) accompanied\u000ahim.The artiste had ideally restricted\u000athe number of presentations\u000ato a few on which\u000ahe could bestow honest attention.\u000aVarna ("Viriboni" -\u000aBhairavi - Pachimirium\u000aAdiappayya) established the\u000aartiste's style in both the areas\u000aof competence and imagination.\u000aEven in faster paces,\u000awhile connecting the swaras\u000aand the phrases through\u000agraces, which were deep and\u000agraceful, the flow remained\u000aundistorted and the melody,\u000aundiminished.Of all the numbers, three\u000adrew special attention:\u000a"Kannanai" (Shanmukhapriya\u000a- Papanasham Shivan),\u000a"Venugana Loluni" (Kedaragowla\u000a- Thyagaraja) and "Satatham\u000aTaavaka"\u000a(Kharaharapriya - Swathy\u000aThirunal). He elaborated\u000athese ragas, of which the last\u000atwo convinced the audience\u000afrom the perspectives of\u000atechnique and creativity.Relatively, the lyrical and\u000aswaraprastara sections were\u000amore absorbing - having presented\u000ain the desired pace.\u000aThough the alapanas were\u000ascholarly, due importance\u000agiven to slower movements\u000awould have brought them on\u000apar with the rasa-bhaava\u000acomponent he infused into\u000athe compositions. The senior\u000aviolinist's approach to Shanmukhapriya\u000awas exemplary -\u000ahe demonstrated appreciable\u000aimagination and restraint\u000ain revealing the finer emotions\u000athe raga inhered.The rhythm accompanists'\u000asoft touches aptly supported\u000athe gentle style of the flautist.A sudden plunge into beatdominated\u000apassages\u000a("Anaathudanu" -Jingla -\u000aThyagaraja) immediately\u000afollowing a melody and\u000amood-oriented composition\u000a"Venugaana Loluni", was in\u000afact an antithesis."Gopalabalam" (presented\u000ain Revagupti - Swathy Thirunal),\u000a"Harithirtha Satya"\u000a(Jaunpuri) and Tillana (Pahadi\u000a- Lalgudi Jayaraman)\u000awere other highlights.***Vedavalli, a veteran artiste\u000apresented vocal concert under\u000athe patronage of\u000aSPVGMC Trust, as part of\u000aGanesha festival music concerts.\u000aLalgudi Vijayalakshmi\u000a(violin), Tumkur B. Ravishankar\u000a(mridanga) and Tumkur\u000aB. Shashishankar (ghata)\u000aaccompanied the artiste.In the present instance,\u000athe artiste revealed all signs\u000aof profound scholarship and\u000aexpertise.\u000aShe sang in a very low\u000apitch and that weakened the\u000avigor.As a consequence she\u000afailed to provide the lift\u000awhich was necessary to infusing\u000avitality into the progressions.\u000aIn addition, it\u000amuffled the lyrics too.Setting aside the above\u000ashortcomings, one may now\u000atake a look at the merits: "Vanajaksha\u000aNinne Kori" (Varna-\u000aMandaari) and\u000a"Varasiddhi Vinayaka" (Kaanada)\u000aboth composed by\u000aMuthayya Bhagavathar, provided\u000aan excellent opportunity\u000afor the listeners to enjoy\u000athe lesser- known compositions.Alapana in Raamapriya\u000awas another treat leading to\u000aPatnam's "Korinavara". She\u000aappended the krithi with a\u000aneraval at "Varijastra" followed\u000aby swarakalpana. In\u000aall these stages, the contribution\u000aof the violinist and the\u000apercussionist proved\u000aimmense.Similarly, Dikshitar's\u000a"Chetashri Balakrishnam"\u000a(Dvijavanthi), "Ekamresha\u000aNayakim" (Shanmukhapriya\u000a- featuring an alapana, a neraval\u000aat Kanchinagara and\u000astrains of swarakalpana) and\u000aThyagaraja's "O Rangashayi"\u000a(Kamboji - the main composition\u000aof the evening) entertained\u000athe audience.\u000aNevertheless, "Nagumomu"\u000a(Abheri- Thyagaraja) did not\u000acarry either the mood of the\u000araga or the sentiments of the\u000alyrics.
