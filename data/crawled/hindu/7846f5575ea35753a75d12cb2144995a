VVisakha Music and Dance Academy gave three youngsters an opportunity to showcase their talent with vocal renditions and lending support on violin and mridangam last Wednesday at Kalabharathi. Disciple of renowned violinist Dwaram Durgaprasada Rao, P. Pavani of Vizianagaram sang first. S. Pardhiva on violin and V.S.J. Sarma on mridangam ably accompanied her. Starting with Abhogi varnam on a brisk note, she next sangVaataapi(Hamsadhvani) andSaarasaaksha(Pantuvarali) with swaram. Then she adeptly renderedNeeducharana Pankajamule(Kalyani) elaborately withaalapana, neravuandswaram. Pardhiva and Sarma lent support and played their turns with matching proficiency. Thus the three proved to be artistes of potential.Disciples of noted vocalist G. Sarada Subrahmanyam of Visakhapatnam, Y. Bhavana and Bh. S.V.R. Krishna Uday also rendered recitals. While the accompanying artistes were the same for Uday, 12-year-old Velcheti Sai Srikar charmingly replaced Sarma on mridangam for Bhavana. Sustaining a fast tempo, she effusively sang Hamsadhvani varnam,Siddhivinayakam(Shanmukhapriya) with swaram andSaarasamukhi(Goudamalhar).She then sangRagasudhaarasa(Andolika) with aalapana and her expansive expatiation ofBiranavaralichithe(Kalyani) next was a fruitful effort. Little Srikar playing nonchalantly on mridangam was the cynosure of all eyes while Bhavani held good promise. Steadily and tunefully sustaining the sedate but appealing tempo he chose, Krishna Uday started singingNammamma Sarade(Hamsadhvani) followed byNannuvidachi(Reethigoula) very evocatively. Then he rendered aalapana of Latangi forAparadhamulanniwhich was concluded with sensible neravu and swaram. Surfacing the Sangeetha Sahitya bhavas embedded in the compositions with empathy, he also held high promise.
