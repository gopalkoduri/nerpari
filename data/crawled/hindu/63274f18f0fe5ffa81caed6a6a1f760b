VVisakha Music and Dance Academy featured a veena recital by noted violinist Vidooshi Ramavarapu Madhuri Devi in Kalabharathi recently. Very ably accompanied on the mridangam by P. Satish Kumar of Chennai and ghatam by local artiste G. Venkata Rao, th\u000ae concert on the whole stood out as a prudent effort perpetuating the rich tradition of exposition of carnatic music on the ancient instrument.Madhuri commenced her recital on a tuneful note with the varnam Sarasangi in Sarasangi, aSampoorna raaganga janyamof the 27th melam and stands marked with Sankarabharana swaras in thepoorvangamand that of Maya\u000amalavagoula in the Uttarangam of its scale. Then she played Utukkad&#8217;sPranavakaram(Aarabhi),Neevalayinchiof GNB (Chayaranjani) andNiravadhisukhadaof Thyagaraja and set an absorbing mood.\u000a The piece-de-resistance of the evening was the expansive expatiation ofHiranmayeemof Dixitar (Lalitha). Her scholarly expression ofManodharmaand dexterous handling of the instrument was marked with flair.Manaviaalakincharadate(Nalinikanthi) of Thyagaraja followed by traditional folk and devotional items constituted the lilting tail-piece. Satish Kumar proved to be her peer in all aspects and while executing Thani along with Venkata Rao.A C.D comprising her renditions in the pure carnatic tradition was released by the founder President of the Academy C.S.N. Raju on the occasion. The critique on it by noted connoisseur of classical music Suri Kumaraswamy was read out by Sripada Venkanna thereafter while P.V.C. Sarma conducted the proceedings.A.R.SBottom Template Starts
