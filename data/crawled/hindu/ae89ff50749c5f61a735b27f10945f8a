He is yet to make a mark among adult singers. He was awarded a gold medal for his proficiency in music by the European Telugu Academy. He was invited by the music sabha Sujanaranjani last week to perform at its venue, Sanathnagar Devasthanam complex. He was in the company of O. Rajasekhar on violin and Ch. Ramakrishna on mridangam.Kalyan Vasanth rendered nearly a dozen numbers in his traditional repertoire, but dominated by Deekshitar&#8217;s compositions. He opened with aKambhoji Varnam,Taruni Ninnuof Tiruvattiyur Thyagayyar.VandehaminHamsadhwaniof Deekshitar withswaramset him well for a smooth flow of music.Annapoorneof Dikshitar inSama,Eti JanmamidiinVarlaliinMisra chapu, coupled with a brief raga essay, were pleasing renditions.ParandhamavatiinDharmavatiwas a rare presentation.Again there was another Dikshitar compositionAkshayalinga VibhoinSankarabharanam.
