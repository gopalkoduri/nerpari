VThe Carnatica Brothers, Sasikiran and Ganesh, grandsons of the legendary Gottuvadyam Narayana Iyer, did justice to their rich musical heritage and expert tutelage under masters such as Chithraveena Narasimhan, Chithraveena Ravikiran, Brinda, Viswanathan and Calcutta Krishnamoorthy. Their judicious selection of ragas and kritis, and a brief introduction of what they were going to sing, made the concert memorable. The duo's passion elevated the standard of the concert.Harmonious renderingThe concert was marked by perfect unison of two voices of varied calibre: Sasikiran's deep and resonant voice, and Ganesh's powerful voice. During ragalapana and swara singing, Sasikiran's rendering in the Manthrasthayi and Ganesh's in the Tharasthayi was an amazing piece of harmony.Kovai Balasubrahmaniam on the violin, Kovai Prakash on the mridangam and P.L.Sudheer on the ghatam provided adequate support throughout the concert.The duo struck a rapport with the audience right from the opening number &#8211; a vivid presentation of the padavarnam &#8216;Chalamela jese' of Sreeranagam Rangaswami Pillai in raga Nattakkurinji, Adi tala.The Swati kriti &#8216;Jayajaya Padmanabha' in Manirang, Adi tala, which followed, was laced with swara strings that converged into korvais, which showcased their expertise in laya.Sasikiran's alapana of raga Panthuvarali was nurtured with care. The Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Aparama bhakthiyentho,' Roopaka tala, was presented with feeling and finesse.&#8216;Sarasasamadana,' a brisk number of Tyagaraja in Kapinarayani, was adorned with lilting manodharmaswara. It was an apt prelude to the main item, a raga-thana-pallavi in the raga &#8216;Chinthamani.'Ganesh started with the ragalapana and Sasikiran took up the tanam. Delineation of the raga was erudite and the tanam was brilliantly woven into attractive sancharas. Then came the rendering of the pallavi &#8216;Devibrova samayamithe&#8230;.' of Syama Sastri. Manodharmaswaras in ragamalika, comprising the rare ragas Choodamani and Ragachoodamani, were proof of their vast repertoire.After the tani, the duo completed the composition with anupallavi and charanam. The concert was concluded with the Dasavathara mangalam of Purandaradasa.
