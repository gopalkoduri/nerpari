VK.J. Yesudas turns lyricist with two songs he has written on Lord Ayyappa. The songs are `Swami en naadhathin uravidame ' in Nityabhushani and `Pulonte paattukal ketta nin kaathukal, Adiyante paattukalum kelkumo Swami' in Kumudapriya ragas."I always wished with all my heart to write a couple of lines on the Lord. That too about a place known for unity, with no differences in the name of caste or religion," he said over the telephone. And truly all the songs in `Kaaniponnu' bear testimony to it.Rare ragasYesudas has always been known for popularising rare ragas.Here, too, he has composed the lines `Chittapol Ayappa Swamithen' written by P.C. Aravindan in Rasikapriya, which is the 72nd melakarta raga in Carnatic music. The number `Uthramam nakshatram' based on Sankarabharanam has a folk touch. `Dukhagalum soukhya swapnagalum' is in the raga Desakshi. Though similar to Bilahari, it is differentiated by its subtleprayoga.Yet another raga used is Nagagandhari for the song `Makarathiru sandhyakku' penned by Aravindan. The lilting melody of `Pambayam ponnattil' in Bilahari soothes the minds of listeners. It stands out for its mellifluous rendering. The other songs include `Sree thozhum' in Saurashtra, and a slokam extolling the virtues of the Lord.The songs are included in a collection of devotionals brought out by Tharangini for this year's Sabarimala mandala season. `Kaaniponnu,' the compact disc contains eight songs and a slokam rendered by Yesudas. The songs retain the magical charm of his golden voice besides creating thebhakti bhava. The music for all the songs have been composed by Yesudas himself. Orchestration has been performed by Sudheer C.Warier.`Kaaniponnu' is the twenty-sixth in a series of devotionals on Swami Ayappan brought out by Tharangini.Bottom Template Starts
