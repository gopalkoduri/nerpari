VWith tempo being the bottomline, the vocal concert of Dr.R.Ganesh took off briskly and the pace was sustained throughout.  Sarasooda, the Saveri varnam  started  in madhyama kalam and rushed into durita kalam in charanam.Abhogi breezed past and surprisingly, N.S.Ramachandran&#8217;s &#8216;Sri Maha Ganapathey&#8217; started off on a slow note. But once the swara segment started, Ganesh&#8217;s innovative and fine swara matrices picked up speed.However, Ganesh also knows where the real essence of his music lies. His alapana sessions on the day of this concert at Amarabharati for Thiruvanmiyur Asthika Samajam,  revealed commendable control and creativity.Of the three ragas identified (Mukhari, Kapi and Sankarabharanam) Kapi&#8217;s elucidation had an edge over the other two because of its colourful structure. Here, Ganesh came up with  phrases exotically redolent and aesthetically linked.The composition &#8216;Kanaka sabhayai kanda pinnum&#8217; was well delivered with swaras. Mukhari was suffused with the necessary melancholy and &#8216;Muripemu galige&#8217;  of Tyagaraja and the  niraval at &#8216;Eeduleni malayamaruthamuche goodina kaveri tata mandu&#8217; lived up to the expectations.Fast paced &#8216;Dorakuna Etu Vanti&#8217; in Bilahari and &#8216;Avarunnaru Brova&#8217; in rare Malavasri (both by Tyagaraja) filled the gaps with the main being Sankarabharnam and the inimitable &#8216;Swara raga sudha.&#8217;The balance and poise Ganesh maintains in the raga expositions unfortunately  tilt in favour of  exuberance once  the kalpanaswara session begins.The unbridled leash   may induce awe and admiration initially. But soon it becomes tedious and the overdose takes away the charm.   Diction and clarity of sahitya  are vital in classical music.Ganesh, perhaps should think on these lines.The percussionists revel when speed takes centre stage.  Melakkaveri Balaji on the mridangam and Papanasam Sethuraman on the kanjira made full use of the opportunity.V.V.Srinivasa Rao proved that he could match Ganesh both on sensitive raga profiles and high velocity swara exercises. His Mukhari especially carried ample piety.
