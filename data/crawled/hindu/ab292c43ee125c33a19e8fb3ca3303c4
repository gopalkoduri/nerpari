VThe greatest attraction of Mala Chandrasekar&#8217;s music is the non-exuberant cheer prevailing in the entire proceedings. The rendition of the kritis exudes charm without being boisterous; soft sans ambiguity; traditional with a contemporary approach.In her flute recital at Sastri Hall organised by Indian Council for Cultural Relations and Sri Ariyakkudi Music Foundation, Mala sustained the audience interest through her fine flow of music. Ariyakkudi, the doyen of Carnatic music,  was remembered for  presenting various compositions which were his favourites and which became popular through his concerts. One such is Dikshitar&#8217;s magnum opus in Khambodi &#8216;Sri Subrahmanyaya Namasthe&#8217;, which occupied the centre-stage in the concert. The raga exposition was controlled with well rounded and extended phrases with special attention to wrap all the three regions.The pallavi, apart from its varied mandatory sangatis, was also given the honour of trikalam that added additional import to the playing. The swara section at &#8216;Vaasavadi Sakala Deva&#8217; in the anupallavai was an engaging energetic dialogue between Mala and violinist Hemalatha, each  contributing kalpanaswaras with dhaivatam as the landing note to build up the final korvai.After the starting &#8216;Sami Ninne&#8217; the Sankarabharanam varnam, it was the lilting &#8216;Subrahmanyena&#8217; in Suddha Dhanyasi. The kalpanaswara addition at &#8216;Venkateswara Subhoojithena&#8217; was lengthy but enjoyable with the swara exchanges tapering and culminating in an excellent finale.The alapana of Pantuvarali that followed this lively item projected the strong face of the raga and here Mala&#8217;s choice was &#8216;Ninne Nera Nammi Naanu&#8217; of Tyagaraja. The exhaustive niraval and swaras in &#8216;Veda Saastra Purana&#8217; carried enough spirit to suit the raga&#8217;s character. For the softer touch, there was Syama Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Mariveregati&#8217; in Anandabhairavi.Mala&#8217;s flute playing shows her control over the instrument as well as her extraordinary lineage, tutelage and experience. The support by Hemalatha on the violin cannot just be called as accompaniment but a wonderful and equal partaking as she exhibited commitment in elevating the concert quality by effective raga interpretations and vivacious swara sallies.Patri Satish Kumar on the mridangam and E.M. Subramaniam on the ghatam underplayed their part but made their presence felt without much bustle.
