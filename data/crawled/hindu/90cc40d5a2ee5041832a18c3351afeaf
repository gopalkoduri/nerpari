VMahathi's vocal concert at Mahatma Gandhi Mandapam, Pollachi, as part of the 39 {+t} {+h} anniversary of Pollachi Tamizhisai Sangam was praiseworthy. She began with &#8216;Ulagam Yaavaiyum' from Kamba Ramayanam and sang many of the familiar and favourite songs. Having studied the pulse of the audience she gave what they wanted and they acknowledged it with delighted applause. She presented the compositions of Muthu Thandavar, Arunachalakkavirayar, Marimutha Pillai, Oothukkadu Venkatakavi and Anayampatti Adishesha Iyer.Her Kavadichindu, &#8216;Pon Ulaavum' was immensely enjoyable. Meera Sivaramakrishnan on the violin and Koviladi Madhwaprasad on the mridangam played to perfection.Emotional portrayalThe magnificent dance ballet, &#8216;Colours of Krishna' by Mysore Badari Divya Bhushan had all the ingredients of great entertainment. The ballet opened with the grand and elaborate wedding of Devaki and Vasudeva depicting all the minute details including oonjal.Dancers have been depicting Yashoda as the quintessential mother over the years in myriad ways.Bhushan, for once took the focus to the fathers. He made people realise that a father can feel as intensely as the mother, with his emotional portrayal of the roles of Vasudeva and Nandagopa, bringing out their joy while being with Krishna, and their agony while being separated from him.The treatment given to the important and entertaining aspects of Krishna's balaleela was fresh and different. The audience was in for a thrilling surprise as Krishna ran in between the rows while being pursued by the Gopis and Putana rose from the audience scaring them for a minute. Bhushan's choreography, with its liveliness and impressive aspects made his ballet unforgettable. His wife Anjana Bhushan and the other participants (students of Bhushan's academy) did their roles with involvement.The excellent orchestra led by Bhuwaneshwar (vocal support) was an added asset.A laugh riotOn the final day, United Visuals, Chennai, staged the Tamil play &#8216;IPL Kudumbam.' Scripted by C.V. Chandramohan, the play brought spurts of laughter with timely one-liners. Sundaramurthy, an out-of-job computer professional, (played by TV.Varadharajen), is mistakenly taken to the Yamaloka by Chitragupta. After the initial protest Sundaramuthy seems to feel at home in Yamaloka and proceeds to computerise the whole celestial system. His family members too join him there soon in the midst of unbelievable yet hilarious situations.Sundaramurthy subjects the divine beings to a volley of questions based on how they treat the poor mortals. They try to justify their actions though a little unconvincingly. During the process the audience is treated to a series of digs at the present day politics, social system, beliefs, etc., with improvised dialogue based on the latest happenings.The play was reasonably successful as an entertainer.
