VHe is not singular here. These are defining qualities of the new age lyricist. Meet Prasoon Joshi, Sayeed Quadri, Swanand Kirkire, Neelesh Misra and Piyush Mishra, who are giving words to the emotions of the new Indian.Incidentally, all of them come from small towns, which many say is the last reservoir of fairy-tale romance, but have different interpretations of their rise. Quadri who comes from Jodhpur, and the only one, who used to attend poetic soirees, for instance, believes it is not the background but his circumstances which worked as a catalyst. &#8220;I came to Mumbai in the late &#8216;80s but was rejected. I became an insurance agent. But the void was there. The antara of &#8216;Awarapan Banjarapan&#8217;describe my situation. Mahesh Bhatt liked the song and my life changed.&#8221;Similarly Piyush, who hails from Gwalior feels it is two decades he spent in Delhi as a wanderer that find a reflection in his songs. The Almora-born Prasoon, who belongs to the family tree of Sumitra Nandan Pant, says: &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that romance is only left in small town India. People in big towns may be pressured with the pace of life but then a short but loving look that a not so young couple may give each other before catching their respective buses or trains to work to me is romance as well. &#8221;However, he agrees his vocabulary and expression is different because it is not borrowed from Hindi cinema. &#8220;When you live in the mountains, there&#8217;s a sense of trust and innocence that stays for a long time... I come from a family where classical music was preferred. Hindi songs were &#8216;not allowed&#8217; for a long time.&#8221; Neelesh, gives much importance to his upbringing in Lucknow and Nainital. &#8220;To me small town is an imaginary island to which we all refer to for creativity. &#8221; Swanand, started from Indore and worked as associate director with Sudhir Mishra. One day, he asked him to write a song for &#8220;Hazaron Khwahishen Aisi&#8221;.  &#8220;Having come from Hindi background and surviving in a cosmopolitan world help me understand the feelings.&#8221;Most of them are multi-tasking. Prasoon excels in giving what the brand demands. Be it &#8220;Thanda Matlab Cola Cola&#8221; or &#8220;Maa&#8221; in &#8220;Taare Zameen Par&#8221;. He says, &#8220;I am a writer-poet. First an adman and lyricist consequently.  To be able to &#8216;communicate&#8217; rather than say or tell is the art of advertising. It hones into you the importance of expression with a purpose.&#8221;Neelesh, who is also a noted journalist, calls this new breed as outsiders who have brought the 9 to 5 work ethic to the industry. &#8220;I wrote &#8216;Kya Mujhe Pyar Hai&#8217; when I was covering militancy in Kashmir. I sent &#8216;Jaadu Hai Nasha Hai&#8217; on email from New York.&#8221; He says at times he doesn&#8217;t even meet the composer before writing the song.Does such prolificacy come with lack of depth? Denies Piyush: &#8220;To me originality is the key. People thought words likemarghatandtabadtoddon&#8217;t fit in film songs. I used them successfully in &#8216;Black Friday&#8217; and &#8216;Tashan&#8217;. I have written &#8216;chhappan tare tod nach loon&#8217;. To me chhappan has a musical quality which others numbers don&#8217;t have.&#8221; A known name in theatre, Piyush avers even Shailendra and Sahir would have changed their language for the SMS generation. Swanand, who has made a name for himself with films like &#8220;Parineeta&#8221;, &#8220;Khoya Khoya Chaand&#8221; and &#8220;Lage Raho Munnabhai&#8221;, says the language doesn&#8217;t matter as long as the sensibility is right. &#8220;What Sahir meant mymohabbat, this generation won&#8217;t understand. I have written both &#8216;Bawra Man Dekhne Chala&#8217; as well as &#8216;Khopri Ke Khopche Mein Khalbali Machaye&#8217; as per the language of the character.&#8221;Neelesh&#8217;s most humbling moment was when a lady from Rudrapur called up to enquire how he understands female mind so well. &#8220;She was referring to &#8216;Jaadu Hai Nasha Hai&#8217;.Quadri, the man behind &#8220;Awarapan Banjarapan&#8221; and &#8220;Bheege Hont Tere&#8221; says he is popular because his songs could be heard in an autorickshaw as well as Mercedes. &#8220;I feel everybody has a poet inside him. &#8221;They complain that FM and music channels are not giving lyricists their due. &#8220;We remember Majrooh and Sahir because AIR used to announce their names before playing the songs. This is no longer the case,&#8221; laments Neelesh.Will they be around for long? Except for Quadri, the others want to diversify. Prasoon is on to his fourth book, Neelesh is branching out to scriptwriting, Swanand wants to direct a film. Piyush says it all. &#8220;I am gifted, you know.&#8221;
