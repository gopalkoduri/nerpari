VVasantha Kannan&#8217;s ability as an accomplished violinist is matched by her prowess as a vocalist. The mother-daughter duo functioned as an efficient team knit by commendable rapport.The recital began on an upbeat note with Calcutta K.S. Krishnamurthy&#8217;s ebullient varnam in Kadanakuthuhalam. It was a ruminative Nattai that cast its spell in Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Ninne Bhajana&#8217; in which the kizhkala swaraprastara showcased leisurely exploration anchored by shuddha swaras at appropriate points, with brisk poruttam-enhanced melkala swaras cutting a clean swathe. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Anuragamuleni&#8217; (Saraswati) was a vehicle for choice sangatis.In Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Sri Balasubramanya,&#8217; the commencing line of the anupallavi, &#8216;Abala Gopa&#8217; is not the easiest of eduppus for kalpanaswara, especially for instrumentalists, but the artistes made safe landings on the wings of catchy kanakkus. A brief sketch of Behag preceded the familiar strains of &#8216;Oruthi Maganai Pirandhu&#8217; (Andal Tiruppavai) the natural madhyamakala gait making the composition an apt filler before the main raga, Bhairavi. Vasantha&#8217;s alapana was built around sensitive, core-perceptive sancharas. In the descending suite, the artiste brought off telling sancharas that illustrated the panchama-madhyama nexus exuding a unique magnetism in this raga. Holding sway with a comfortable kalapramana that avoided sag, Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Balagopala&#8217; supported kalpanaswaras wherein the older artiste&#8217;s experience came to the fore in the skeins of kizhkala swara that conveyed a feel for vistara, and in the free-flowing melkala swaras with kuraippu centred at the panchama.Calcutta K. Mohan&#8217;s excellent grip on kalapramana and his sound instinct for bridging pauses with sprightly melkala sollus facilitated easy teamwork, with Ernakulam S. Ramakrishnan&#8217;s measured strokes on the ghatam adding to the appeal of the thani.
