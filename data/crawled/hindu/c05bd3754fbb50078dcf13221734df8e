VSruti Sagar's flute concert for Valayapatti Nadalaya began with a Mallari. It was natural, as the thavil played a major part in the ensemble. The other artists were Karaikkal Venkatasubramanian on the violin, Sundar on the tabla and Papanasam Sethuraman on the ganjira. So predominant was the thavil's sound that Malarvannan had to tone down the decibel level for the convenience of the rasikas in the Adyar Ananthapadmanabhaswami temple auditorium. (He could have dispensed with the mike and yet it would have impressed the rasikas.)With a brief alapana of Sahana, Sruti Sagar played &#8216;Vandanamu Raghunandana' of Tyagaraja. The Anandabhairavi alapana was shared by both the flautist and the violinist Karaikkal Venkatasubramanian.Enjoyable fare&#8216;Marivere Gati' was the kriti that Sruti Sagar chose to play for the evening. The swaraprastharam was a dual between Sruti Sagar and Venkatasubramanian and was enjoyable for the competitive fare they offered. It looked as if there was no strict format as such. The highlight of the programme, however, was the alapana of raga Dvijavanthi by Sruti Sagar and Venkatasubramanian, both vying with each other in portraying the alluring raga in all its glorious glides and shades, in their respective turns.The tanam handled by Venkatasubramanian on the violin added lustre and charm, as the raga lent a lot of scope for such embellishments. Dikshitar's kriti &#8216;Akhilandeswari' was truly a musical splendour that evoked an atmosphere of tranquility. The artists then embarked on a lengthy chain of kalpanaswara and the garland included Bowli, Bilahari, Behag and Kapi.The short thani by Malarvannan (thavil), Sundar (tabla) and Sethuraman (ganjira) livened up the evening's proceedings. If the sound of the tavil was naturally high, the ganjira by Papanasam Sethuraman was truly admirable, while Sundar's tabla was crisp.
