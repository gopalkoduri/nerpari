VPurandaradasa, the bard of Karnataka, was a prolific composer of Devarnamas, which are bhakti-laden hymns in the Kannada language. He pioneered systematic music lessons for learners of Carnatic music. Unfortunately many of his compositions have been lost over time, but the ones that survive are examples of his genius and mastery of the handling of the Sapta swaras.TributeAs a tribute to the legendary composer, K. Venkataramanan gave a vocal recital consisting of Purandaradasar kritis only. &#8216;Saranu Siddhi Vinayaka' in Natta was the opening piece of the concert. This Ganesha sthuthi is commonly sung in Sourashtram. The ragalapana, niraval and swaraprasthara of the Abhogi compositon &#8216;Baba Ranga Bhujanga Sayana' were remarkably sweet.Violinist N.C. Madhav impressively shadowed the vocalist. Then Professor Venkataramanan chose &#8216;Ninne Dayalo' in Ananda Bhairavi in Mishra Chapu tala. The smooth shift from Thodi to Mohanam and Hindolam and back to Thodi was effortlessly and gracefully rendered. &#8216;Enu Dhanyano' in Roopaka tala bore the stamp of devotion of Purandaradasar kritis.A swift singing of the Atana piece &#8216;Sakalagrabala' laid the platform for the main item of the day in Panthuvarali, also known as Kamavardhini. Nuances of the ragas were melodiously etched in the elaboration of the raga. The tani by percussionists Palladam Ravi (mridangam) and Kottayam Unnikrishnan (ghatam) was a fitting finale to the piece-de- resistance of the evening &#8211; &#8216;Ninne Dhyanava.'Shifting gear from the heights of Panthuvarali to the melodious Mand, Professor Venkataramanan sung &#8216;Baro Nama Manage,' to the delight of the rasikas. &#8216;Ramamantrapa,' heard commonly in Jonpuri, was sung in Syam Kalyan, which is no less beautiful. The concert came to an end with the mangalam in Madhyamavathi, the lyrics beginning &#8216;Bhagyada Lakshmi.'The concert, held at the Sree Karthika Thirunal Theatre, Thiruvananthapuram, was organised by the Sri Swati Tirunal Sangita Sabha.
