VThe Nadajyothi Sri Thyagaraja Swamy Bhajan Sabha, in association with Ananya, Bangalore, conducted the N. Ramachandra Memorial Yuvotsava recently. A vocal recital by S. Ramani, accompanied by Shankar Rajan (violin), Karthik Rajan (mridanga) and Srinivas (morsing) was part of the festival.The performance commenced with a two speed rendition of &#8220;Viriboni&#8221;, the ata thala varna in Bhairavi, effectively highlighting the imposing gamaka infused structure of the composition. A brief outline of Natta was then followed by Purandaradasa's &#8220;Vandisuvu&#8221; set to khanda chapu thala, bedecked with a few kalpana swaras. A marginally slower pace would have enhanced the lyrical and melodic appeal of the next piece, Deekshithar's &#8220;Balasubrahmanyam Bhajeham&#8221; in Surutti raga and adi thala, which led to a compact but evocative alapana of Mayamalalavagaula. &#8220;Thulaseedalamulache&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in rupaka thala was supplemented with a well executed neraval, at the charanam line beginning &#8220;Saraseeruha Punnaga&#8221;, notable for its pronounced emphasis on the the thara sthayi and incorporating fluid and attractive patterns. The ensuing kalpana swaras in two speeds included some simple rhythmic combinations and maintained a sense of proportion.Shyama Shastri's &#8220;Devi Brova Samayamide&#8221; in Chinthamani raga and adi thala, and Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadeyar's &#8220;Chinthayami Jagadambam Chamundambam&#8221; in Hindolam and jhampa thala, followed in quick succession. A swift rendering of &#8220;Anupama Gunambudhi&#8221;, the Thyagaraja composition in Athana raga and khanda chapu thala, was prelude to the main item of the evening, a raga thana pallavi in Shanmukhapriya. The fairly detailed alapana was suffused with raga bhava and replete with a variety of phrases punctuated with plain notes and gliding sancharas, bearing testimony to ample manodharma aided by full throated articulation, with no excessive attempts at modulation, and excellent voice control. The meticulous progression of the thanam was notable for clarity and depth of enunciation. The expansive delineation of the beautifully constructed pallavi &#8220;Sharavanabhava Guruguhane Kumarane Shanmukhane&#8221;, set to adi thala, was augmented by the mandatory rhythmic variations of the sahithya. Elaborate kalpana swaras in two speeds, concluding with a spell of diminishing thala cycles ending at the panchama, supported by earnest accompaniment from the violinist and percussionists and culminating in a vibrant thani avarthana, ensured that the well constructed raga thana pallavi occupied pride of place in the performance. On the whole the concert was characterised by a lively tempo, scrupulous adherence to tradition, a good selection of ragas drawn from a number of composers, and a keen aesthetic sense.
