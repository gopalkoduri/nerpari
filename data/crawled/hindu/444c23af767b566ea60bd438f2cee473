College of Music, Thripunithura, treated them to excellent classical music.Organised by Rasikapriya at Andhra Cultural Organisation Auditorium, Subramanian began his concert with a varnam in raga Thodi. It was followed by `Namami Vigna Vinayala' in Hamsadwani, composed by Krishna Swami Iyer.He then took up raga Lalitha, culminating in the kriti by Shyama Sastri, `Nannu Brova Lalitha.' After an impressive elaboration of `Mukhari,' Tyagaraja's composition `Sarasiruhanana' was well rendered. `Sri Mathtubootham,' by Dikshitar in Kannada, `Paripalayamam' by Swati Tirunal in Ritigoula and `Deva Deva Jagadeeswara' also by Swati Tirunal in `Poorvikalyan' followed.The main raga of the evening was `Kamboji,' in which the musician took up thanam and pallavi.

Anantharaman, provided excellent support on the violin while Alleppey G. Chandrasekharan Nair, disciple of Mavelikkara Velukkutty Nair, played the mridangam. The thaniavarthanam' was excellent.The concluding pieces included `Ennathavam' in Kapi and a thillana in `Sankarabharanam.'
