VGuruguhagaanam, an evening devoted entirely to the music of Muttuswami Deekshithar, was organised recently in Bangalore by Guruguhaamrta in association with Sri Krishna Kalakshetra (ISKCON). The main focus of the programme, which included an introduction to the life and times of the great composer by G.Ravi Kiran, vocalist and Managing Trustee of Guruguhaamrta, was on a group rendition of Deekshithar's compositions on Lord Krishna by well known young artistes, ably accompanied by Charulatha Ramanujam (violin), C. Cheluvaraju (mridanga) and N. Gurumurthy (ghata).The first group, comprising G. Ravi Kiran, S. Ashok, M.B. Hariharan, S.R. Vinay, K.V. Krishna Prasad, C.K. Pavandeep and Mahesh Narayanan, began with &#8220;Balakrishnam Bhavayami&#8221; set to Gopikavasantha raga and aditala. A ragamalika sloka served as prelude to the Jujavanthi krithi &#8216;Chetha Sri Balakrishnam' in rupaka thala, followed by &#8220;Parimalaranganatham&#8221; in Hamirkalyani, also in rupaka tala. &#8220;Krishnananda Mukunda Murare&#8221; in Gaulipanthu raga and misra chapu thala was rounded off with kalpana swaras with each of the singers taking turns.Amritha Venkatesh, Anjali Sriram, Aishwarya Vidya Raghunath, Tanmayee Krishnamurthy, Srinidhi Balaji, Srila and Vrinda Acharya jointly presented &#8220;Ananta Balakrishnam&#8221; in Ishamanohari raga and adi thala, &#8220;Sri Krishnam Bhajare&#8221; in Rupavathi, &#8220;Sri Vidya Rajagopalam&#8221; in Jaganmohana, and &#8220;Sri Venugopala&#8221; in Kurinji raga and jhampa thala. On the whole a sedate tempo was maintained, and due emphasis was laid on their lyrical cadence and structural grandeur and uniqueness of the compositions. The inclusion of several rare pieces vouched for the dedication of the organisers and participants alike, providing glimpses into the multi-faceted splendours of Deekshithar's legacy.Prasanna Venkataraman, accompanied by C.N. Chandrasekhar (violin), Trivandrum Balaji (mridanga) and S.N. Narayana Murthy (ghata), presented a vocal concert under the auspices of Sree Ramakrishna Bhajana Sabha Trust.The initial stages of the recital were enlivened by the ata tala varna in Shankarabharanam, &#8220;Sundarathara Deham&#8221; in Pantuvarali and &#8220;Thyagaraja Yoga Vaibhavama&#8221; in Anandabhairavi. A mellifluous alapana of Hindolam was followed by Arunachala Kavi's &#8220;Ramanukku Mannan Mudi&#8221; in adi thala, and supplemented by a spate of vibrant and fluent kalpana swaras.A swift &#8220;Neeye Sharanam Shanmukha&#8221;, Papanasam Sivan's composition in Kamboji raga and adi tala was precursor to a fairly detailed elaboration of Mohanam replete with intricate and spontaneous phrases. Diverse embellishments on a basic motif were attempted around the panchama, while the potential of a soft and malleable voice was explicit in the bhriga-laden sancharas around the thara sthayi shadja. Thyagaraja's &#8220;Mohana Rama&#8221; in adi tala, ornamented with kalpana swaras, was succeeded by a tani avarthana.Saveri was taken for an alapana of moderate length, highlighting its distinct, yet subtle inflections and suffused with raga bhava. While the ensuing thana was succinct and well contoured, the pallavi beginning &#8220;Saveri Ragapriyam&#8221;, set to tisra jathi triputa thala, was briefly expanded and suffixed with kalpana swaras that included short segments in Kalyanavasantham and Shahana. Though better concert planning would have ensured more time for the raga tana pallavi, the exercise bore testimony to the artiste's ample improvisational powers and sound grasp of technique, buttressed by prompt and expert support from the violinist and percussionists.
