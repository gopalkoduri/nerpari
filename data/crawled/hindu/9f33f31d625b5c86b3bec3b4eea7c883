VIn a computer it is so easy to cut a text from one place and paste it at a different place. This little master of Carnatic music too seems to have deployed the &#8216;cut &amp; paste' arrangement available in computers in his recent concert held under the aegis of Sree Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha recently in the Capital. Conventionally, a varnam is taken up as an opening piece. Vocalist T.M. Krishna took up, as the central piece, an Adi tala varnam, &#8220;Samidaya&#8221; in raga Kedara Gowla, composed by Tiruvottriyur Tyagayyar, for detailed presentation, with an elaborate raga alapana and niraval of the phrase &#8220;Srimadadipuri nivasa Sri Thiyagesa&#8221;. This was even followed by tani avartanam (percussion solo).Similarly, as the third item in his concert, after a detailed alapana of the raga Kalyani, Krishna took up a javali, which is usually presented towards the end of the concert. He even suffixed it with detailed swaraprastaras. Krishna opened his concert straightaway with a weighty &#8220;Swararagasudha&#8221; of Tyagaraja in raga Sankarabharanam, following it with neraval of the phrase &#8220;Muladharaja nadameruguta&#8221; and swaraprastaras. But for these aberrations, Krishna's recital was a brilliant one with his deep musical skills coming to the fore.There may not be written rules on concert structuring. But as a convention, a certain pattern has emerged and is being followed over the years. Krishna seemed to be attempting to bring about changes in the convention. One wonders whether he would have attempted this at the beginning of his career. Now that he is an established artiste the seemingly &#8216;take-it-or-leave-it' approach is unkind.Krishna's ragam-taanam-pallavi, though not elaborate, was brilliantly presented. The pallavi &#8220;Chithsabayil nadamadum deivame katharul karunai pozhiyum harane&#8221; in raga Kanada was set to Khanda jati triputa tala. While his sketch of the raga and the taanam were delightful, creativity flowed during the ragamalika swaraprastaras in ragas Kanada, Latangi and Sindhu Bhairavi, especially while traversing from the mandra sthayi Shadja to the anutaara sthayi Shadjam.Talented youngsterIn another concert in the same festival, Abhishek Raghuraman, a highly talented youngster, loaded too many bhrigas into his rendering, which did not evoke a comforting listening experience. Abhishek started off very impressively with an Adi tala varnam in raga Saveri. While singing Tyagaraja's Pancharatna kriti &#8220;Sadhinchane&#8221; in raga Arabhi, he left the swaras for various charanams to be played by his violin accompanist and sang only the sahityam. One felt it was quite unjust to do so. As his central item, Abhishek took up Tyagaraja's &#8220;Kaligiyunde&#8221; in Keeravani with a detailed sketch of the raga. The neraval of the phrase &#8220;Baguga Sri Raghu Ramuni padamula&#8221; and the subsequent swaraprastaras brought out his creative talents.H.N. Bhaskar on the violin, Manoj Siva on the mridangam and Alathur Rajaganesh provided able support to both Krishna and Abhishek in their concerts.
