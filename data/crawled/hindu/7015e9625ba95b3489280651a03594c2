VThe thought of presenting Carnatic music  to an audience that is attuned to the khyal form in Hindustani seemed daunting.The magic of music is that it is the language of memory. There are several moments in time that stand frozen in my memory, and I believe they inform my melody unconsciously on stage. I am not aware, except at that still point where my audience and I \u000aexperience God together. At that precise, sculpted moment, it does not seem to matter to anyone of us that the melody is rendered in an ancient language. Nor does it matter that the musical structure is informed by any geographical boundaries. This is where my soul begins to dance. It is a primeval space, where 15,000 people seem to think one thought, breathe in the same energy. I do not think of these moments as anything other than a tryst with the divine.I was recently at the Sawai Gandharva festival in Pune. I consider it a rare honour, especially since this festival was under the leadership of  Pandit Bhimsen Joshi. I found this atmosphere to be something special. There were people from all over the country, dedicating their time and energies towards the pursuit of they considered holier than all other forms of worship &#8211; listening to music. The festival saw the participation of many greats, including  Prabha Atre, Pandit Jasraj and the Rajan-Sajan Mishra duo, among others. I was  glad to also see our very own Ganesh and Kumaresh in the line-up.Despite my journey of several performances all over the globe, the thought of presenting  Carnatic music to an audience that is attuned to the khyal form of music in the Hindustani style seemed daunting. This task was made even more complicated by the fact that I only had an hour in which to structure my presentation. Given the large number of artists who present their music at such occasions, the time limit is strictly adhered to.I do not know what is about the Raga Brindavana Saranga that makes it so special to me. Perhaps it is the combination of Krishna and the name &#8216;Ranga&#8217;, my most potent and driving divine inspirations. I chose to start my presentation with the kriti &#8216;Rangapuravihara&#8217; by Muthuswamy Dikshitar. Whenever I sing this composition, I think of its distinct musical vibration. Like the vimana of the Srirangam temple that rises above the mundane clutter, shorn of all embellishments, this composition too rises. Gently at first, vivifying the raga and presenting its grandeur, one delectable note at a time. To me, presenting this at this sacred space was like the experience of the sun&#8217;s golden rays in the morning hours, revealing new shades of the composition, connecting me with the divine instantaneously.For the second piece, I chose Thodi. After an elaborate alapana, I sang &#8216;Thaye Yasoda&#8217;, another of my favourites. I was delighted at the response. Both the Thodi kalpanaswaras with their typical gamaka-laden flavour that were rendered at a slow tempo and the lightning &#8212; fast precision in the fast tempo were received extremely well.For the last piece, I rendered the Oothukadu Kalinga Narthana tillana, after a brief introduction to Venkatasubbier&#8217;s legacy. This was a form they had never heard before. It took them by pleasant surprise and I could almost see them dancing with joy.It was, however during the abhang that I felt myself completely surrender to the notion of &#8216;Vittala&#8217;, the form in which Ranganatha is revered in that region. Vittala is more than merely a divine manifestation. He is at once a way of thinking, a contemplation of the highest ideal and the much needed drop of wisdom to a heart parched with query. &#8216;Thirtha Vittala&#8217; is a Bhimsen Joshi classic, and as I performed these immortal words, the term &#8216;sapadla&#8217;, the Marathi equivalent of &#8216;I have found&#8217; slowly juxtaposed itself against the overpowering force of memory, to become &#8216;I have been found.&#8217;At the end of the one-hour recital, I was met with cries for encores, leaving me with a highly exalted feeling. Indeed, this was a special and memorable evening. I was delighted when an interviewer even asked me how I felt at being the only artist in the festival who was met with such a tumultuous response!In an atmosphere that seems rife with fear and insecurity following the reign of terror, the unifying power of the bhakti sampradaya compositions is perhaps an effective antidote. They do more than merely bridge the distance between the Cauvery and the Chandrabagha. For me, they are the ultimate connection towards finding inner harmony.
