VChristmas means Handel's iconic oratorio &#8216;The Messiah' is being played and performed in the English-speaking world. &#8216;The Messiah' was for Handel a question of one door shutting and another opening. His Italian Opera phase was over ending in rivalry and failure. He was planning to return to his birth place &#8212; Germany when a man called Jennings presented him with the libretto of a new oratorio based on poems from the Bible. Handel got down to work and Halleluiah it was a hit.Based on three parts, the first is all Christmas with songs like &#8216;Every Valley' and choruses like &#8216;For unto us a child is given unto us a son is born' and the exquisite pastoral symphony. Ironically, it was first performed during Easter in Dublin, but the second show in London became a hit and it has remained a part and parcel of Christmas celebration for over 300 years.In Germany, J.S. Bach is synonymous with Christmas &#8212; his &#8216;Christmas Oratorio' and &#8216;Christmas Cantata' and Heinrich Schutz's &#8216;Christmas Story' and Michael Pretorius' &#8216;Christmas Mass.' These three composers established the Lutherian tradition. In France, Marc Antoine Charpentier with his stunningly beautiful religious music is a must during &#8216;Noel.'Celebrating ChristmasThough Christmas music is primarily a vocal tradition going back to the Middle Ages and even earlier to Gregorian Chants, there is a strong instrumental aspect too to it, beginning with Italian Baroque and Arcangelo Corelli's &#8216;Christmas Concerto.'All the Baroque composers loved to celebrate Christmas with music making, dance, hymns and carols. But there was a sharp decline in Christmas music from the classical age. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven hardly have specific music connected to Christmas and in fact Beethoven's great &#8216;Mass Missa Solemnis' was dubbed &#8220;The Black Mass&#8221; by contemporaries.This lack of interest continued into the Romantic Age with the exception of a few composers. Berlioz wrote a Christmas specific work &#8216;The infancy of Christ' and Brahms and Bruckner some Noel songs and lullabies. It came to a minor composer Franz Xavier Gruber to write the most famous Christmas hymn of them all &#8216;Silent Night Holy Night' which has been translated into almost every language in the Christian world.Ironically, it is the contemporary world which debates endlessly about God being dead, that has shown a keen interest in Christmas music.Poulenc, a French was a prolific composer of religious music including Christmas hymns, so were English composers Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Benjamin Britten. Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki composed a Christmas symphony, a solemn and sad work without any laughter and joy. It reflects the age of fear, filled with wars, terror and angst. The Estonian composer Arvo Part has composed endless religious music including for Christmas and so has the English John Taverner.Religious musicArguably, the prolific interest in Christmas music that the Baroque composers showed will not repeat itself. But the nineteenth century composers have created religious music. These composers are not associated with religious music as such with the exception Anton Bruckner whose monumental Masses and Christmas songs are an exception. Bruckner was brought up by the church and in all he did there was a strong sense of belief.This belief also surfaces in the still neglected Robert Schumann whose music for children has a strong religious bias. The flamboyant Franz Liszt who became an Abbey also composed religious music. Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov composed choral music for the traditional Russian church. These &#8220;Vespers&#8221; are the quintessence of solemnity and piety. Continuing this tradition, Shostakovich also composed religious songs including Christmas songs.There will always be a difference in the output of Baroque composers of religious music and those that followed down the stream. During the Baroque, the church dictated human creativity and commissioned musical works. This changed in the nineteenth and twentieth century . They questioned the existence of God and did not accept without logic the prevalence of power, piety and omnipotence.In the twentieth and the new century, humanity is confronted with a changing world and decline of traditional values. Thus, a return to God is a route composers have taken to understand the meaning of existence.The innocence and purity of Christmas has become the symbol of a lost world that we desperately want to find. So we see a musician like the Beatles' Paul McCartney composing a traditional mass &#8216;Behold My Heart' which is as beautiful as any religious music of the masters. The surprise is neither Christmas nor man has changed.
