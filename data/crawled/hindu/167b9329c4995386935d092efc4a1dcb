VV.R.Dileep Kumar enthralled  connoisseurs of music at a vocal concert  at  M.D.R.Auditorium, Chembai Smaraka Music College. His erudition and zest enriched the concert. He captured the beauty and grandeur of vilambakala and his bhava-laden voice was  perfectly aligned to the sruthy.He was accompanied by  Attukal Balasubrahmaniam on the violin, Palakkad Mahesh Kumar on the mridangam and Adichanallur M.Anil Kumar on the ghatam. Dileep began the concert with an  Adi tala varnam in Thodi, &#8216;Eranapai,&#8217; composed by Pattanam Subrahmania Iyer. He sang the poorvanga in two speeds and utharanga in second speed.  A Ganapathy stuti &#8216;Girirajasuthathanaya,&#8217; a brisk number of Tyagaraja in  raga Bangala, set to Adi tala, was adorned with impeccable manodharma swara.An Ekeikaraga kriti of Tygaraja, &#8216;Nennerunchera napairnichala,&#8217; in  raga Simhavahini (derived from the 27th melakartharaga Sarasangi), set to Adi tala, was followed by another majestic Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Mudduvenuka&#8217; in  Darbar, set to Adi tala.Dileep Kumar essayed  melodic phrases of  Ranjani that were soaked in  bhava.A Ganapathi Sachidananda Swamikal composition, &#8216;Dathathreya moorthiroopa Thribhuvana rakshaka,&#8217; set to Misrachappu,  was sung at a slow pace, adhering to the elegance of the composition.Dexterous elaboration of the 28th melakartaraga Harikamboji for 30 minutes, bringing out the intricacies and nuances of the raga, showcased his command over classicism.Another  Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Dinamani vamsa,&#8217; set to Adi tala (two kala), was embellished with artistic niraval at &#8216; Sarva vinutha nannu.&#8217;  Mahesh Kumar&#8217;s smooth and harmonious beats enhanced the laya.  Anilkumar also complemented him well. The thani was outstanding with beautiful arithmetical phrases.A Javali &#8216;Saramaina matalentho,&#8217; in  Behag, set to Roopaka tala, and a padam &#8216;Alarsara parithapam&#8217; in  Surutti, set to Misrachapputhala, both compositions of Swati Tirunal, were sung melodiously.The vocalist wound up the concert with a  lilting number &#8216;Karpakame kanparai,&#8217; a composition of Papanasam Sivanan, and a sloka &#8216;Sree Ramachandra srithajanaparijatha&#8217; in Madhyamavathi.
