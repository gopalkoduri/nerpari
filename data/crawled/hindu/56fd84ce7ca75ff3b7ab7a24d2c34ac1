VVijayalakshmi and Chitra (Mambalam Sisters) sang at Mysore&#8217;s Ganabharathi, accompanied by Hemalatha (violin), H.L. Shivashankaraswamy (mridanga), B. Shashishankar (ghata) and K.S. Rangaraj (khanjira).The concert was marked by good planning, neatness in structuring the presentations, and a sense of aesthetic values. Dedicated to Veene Sheshanna, the concert exclusively highlighted his compositions, which fostered a deep sense of devotion and philosophy, and displayed the composer&#8217;s imaginative acumen in the grammar of music.&#8220;Neerajakshi vinivamma&#8221; (Varna-Saveri) thrived not only because of the appealing raga and scholarly construction, but also because of the measured progressions the singers followed and the sukshmagamakas they executed.Yet, as the presentations of the lyrics were not direct from memory, one could mark laxity in intonations and impact. The same shortcoming undermined, to a certain extent, two Swarajatis: in Vanaspati and Khamach.All the artistes on the stage admirably contributed to the melodic verdancy of &#8220;Rama ninnu&#8221; (Anandabhairavi). The alapana featured a systematic development, smoothly spanning over the required three sthayis, reinforced by the melody accompanist&#8217;s vibratos, that were at times tremolos, and the glides and subtle curves.An ideal tempo, falling between vilamba and madhyama kaala, facilitated easy comprehension of the text. The emotive aspects enshrined in the composition emerged meaningfully in the neraval at anupallavi, &#8220;Shyamalanga sadananda&#8221;; and the kalpanaswaras harmonised with the mood thus elicited.The gravity of the lyrics &#8220;Tharamugadhura paramatma&#8221; (Dharmavati) and &#8220;Shripathe premamuga&#8221; (Ganamurthy) warranted slower tempos, assisted by introspective involvement.Other highlights were &#8220;Emani dhelupudura&#8221; (Vachaspati) featuring fluent alapana, neraval at the charana, crisp kalpanaswaras and metrically intricate thani avarthana, and a thillana (Faraz).*** Nadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha had organised Ananya&#8217;s bharatanatya performance. It was a rare experience. Rajeshwari Pandit (vocal), Guru Brinda (natuvanga), Narayan (violin), Ramesh (mridanga) and Rajesh (flute) constituted the music ensemble.Her dedication is her forte, and her well-groomed practice has strengthened her inherent instincts and intuitions.The choreography provided ample provision for pleasing and challenging expressions; a major share was allotted to abhinaya. Pure dance sections, imaginatively inserted, rendered the performance interesting and attractive.Take for example either the invocative Ganeshavandana (&#8220;Vandisuvudadiyali&#8221;-Purandaradasa) or the Shivasthuti (&#8220;Yaradinaar&#8221;- Charukeshi). The dancer&#8217;s graceful movements covered the stage, laasya governing all the subtle actions. Intricacies in the thala patterns did not hinder either the footwork, the vinyasas or fine expressions. Synchronisation established between the necessary entities of dancing ruled her next number too, a padavarna, &#8220;Devar munivar&#8221; (Shanmukhapriya-Lalgudi Jayaraman).The varna was an admirable testimony of her credentials.Consider the portrayal of Draupadi while narrating sequences selected from Mahabharata: anticipation, anxiety, deeply-hurt pride, humiliation and devotion convincingly carved the touching picture of a hapless queen. &#8220;Sita swayamvara&#8221; (ragamalika) and &#8220;Shringapuradhishwari&#8221; (Kalyani-Padmacharan) were other highlights to consummate the quality of the concert.
