VIf Tirukkodikaval Krisnayyar, uncle of Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer who is supposed to have played a violin solo for the first time in the history of Carnatic music, had been present at the Rugmini Kalyana Mandapam in Thripunithura, on April 26, he woul\u000ad have been elated by the manner his nephew&#8217;s disciple and accompanist T.N. Krishnan, brought forth the succulence of the ragas and the sublime traits in  the compositions.His innate ability to project the &#8216;jeeva&#8217; of a raga only with the initial flourishes of the bow (and without any finger-slips), was manifest in the lovely &#8216;padavarnam&#8217; &#8216;Chala mela&#8217; in Nattakurinji, composed by Moolai Veedu Rangaswamy Nattuvanaar.It is not often that Hamsadhwani is presented in a glistening garb of melody and TNK did that by making his violin sing.   His  bowing created a memorable &#8216;Vaathaapi&#8217; with a tapestry of swaras.  His skill brought alive the lyrical beauty and majesty of &#8216;Endaro.&#8217; The alluring musical visions in Khamas merged suitably with &#8216;Broche vaa.&#8217;How purity of individual notes (&#8216;sthaana sudham&#8217;) is crucial for building up a raga edifice was shown through the exposition of Sree ranjini. The slides and glides lavished on &#8216;Soga suga&#8217; made it a crystallised quintessence of the  raga.The raga Yadukula Kambhoji was portrayed neatly before he played &#8216;Hecharikagaa&#8217; set to Jhampa. Then it was the turn for Thodi, in which the &#8216;gaayaki&#8217; style, a characteristic feature of Tripunithura Narayana Iyer Krishnan, swayed the listeners.The frolicking mood in &#8216;Thaaye Yasodhe&#8217; was conveyed  through  the perfect synchronisation between the bowing and fingering.When Umayalpuram Sivaraman plays the mridangam, there is no area in the domain of &#8216;Laya&#8217; that goes untouched.  His thani was played along with Tripunithura Radhakrishnan.The concert was organised in connection with a programme, organised for the seventh consecutive year, to pay homage to  M.D. Ramanathan.It was an apt  tribute to the maestro as both  T. N. Krishnan and Umayalpuram had accompanied the legend on several occasions.
