VSongs in praise of the celestial flautist, Lord Krishna, have been played by G. Sridhar on the flute to the accompaniment of V. Suresh Babu on the violin, Mannarkoil J. Balaji on the mridangam and Madipakkam Murali on the ghatam. "Ganamurthe" of Tyagaraja,  played with melody and focus on the suddha gandharam, is a pleasing interpretation of Hamsavinodhini. The scale sans the panchamam is elaborated with fluency and Narayana Teertha's "Saranam Bhava" tuned beautifully by T. M. Thiagarajan mirror the artiste's musical sensitivity. The artiste's alapana of Dharmavati dotted with mellifluous phrases evokes a positive listening response, while the violinist also puts his best foot forward in presenting a delineation of quality. Ambujam Krishna's "Ododi Vandhen" with its joyous gait, the expansion of the lyrics, and the kalpanaswaras are an entertaining package.The ragamalika solfa sequences alternately between the main artiste and the violinist in Sallabham (Surya), Revati, Vasanti, and Behag, also played in the reverse order to come back to Dharmavati and a shadja kuraippu topped with a korvai, provide sustained listening interest. The tani avartanam by the percussionists with tidy rhythmic patterns merits appreciation. Dothakkadu Venkata Kavi's popular "Alai payudhe", Purandaradasa's evergreen "Jagadhodharana," "Kurai Ondrum Illai" by Rajaji, "Katrinile varum geetham" and the divine lyrics "Maithreem Bhajatha" by Maha Periavar of Kanchi that have received such mesmerising musical expression from the melody maker, supreme M. S. Subbulakshmi, leave the rasika on an emotional, nostalgic zone.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
