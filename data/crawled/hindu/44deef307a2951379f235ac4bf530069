VMaithreem BhajathaDevotional CDDr. Radha Bhaskar Mudhra Recording Co. (Rs.100)\u000aDr. Radha Bhaskar is an involved musician whose artistic cap is packed with many colourful feathers. As a vocalist, musicologist, organiser, an editor of a music magazine and critic, she has made her mark in several areas of Carnatic music. Her latest venture is a devotional audio album titled, `Maithreem Bhajatha,' comprising hymns in different languages. Radha, with her pleasant sruti-aligned voice, leads the singing group with melodic and aesthetic sensitivity. The youngsters who form the choral ensemble do well to do justice to the genre. The keyboard artiste Venkat, and N. Sundar (tabla) are assets to the programme. This audio volume  will go a long way to establish a praiseworthy bhakti connection with listeners.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
