VAamaiTamil devotional AVM audioShobha Chandrasekhar,  wife of  cine director and producer S. A. Chandrasekhar and mother of popular actor Vijay, springs a  pleasant surprise on rasikas with her light classical music album of Tamizh devotional songs on the celestial siblings Lord Ganesha and Sri Muruga.Shobha, blessed with a fluent, well-trained voice is a playback singer and also a devotional music artiste with many public programmes to her credit. She is an ardent admirer of the style of Maharajapuram Santhanam. Her musical expression in this volume is reflective of an artiste blessed with multiple gifts such as sharp artistic acumen, capacity for mellifluous presentation and a natural flair to sustain aural interest.She has chosen melodic compositions by Papanasam Sivan, Thanjavur Sankara Iyer, K. Somu, Guru Surajananda, Lakshmi Natarajan and Arunagirinathar and has done justice to the emotional lyrics with her involved oral expression. L. Krishnan, a veteran in instrumental orchestration, as always, displays his class and calibre.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
