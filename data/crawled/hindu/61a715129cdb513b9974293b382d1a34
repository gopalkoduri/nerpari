V&#8220;Fools who came to scoff remained to pray,&#8221; said a famous poet about a village preacher. The two-hour Carnatic vocal recital by M. J. Daniel drew skeptics and commoners alike who sat spell-bound in rapt attention.Right from the word go it was a unique concert. It opened with a swarajati in Yadukula Khambhoji ragam (Misra chaapu talam) in place of the regular varnam format. Shyama Sastri's Kamaakshi nee padayugame sharanamani nammi&#8230; brought out the yearning for the divine mother in the deepest emotive tones. The rich texture and tenor of the vocalist's rendition vested the song with a beatific vision that only the composer could have envisaged. That said it all as far as the audience was concerned. The Sri vidya ganesha&#8230; in Abhogi (Adi) a composition by Daniel's guru N. Ch, Butchaiahcharyulu was another rippling piece with the chitta swaram in stylistic variations providing the embellishment to the soft flowing lyric. Nannu ganna talli naa bhagyama&#8230; a Thyagaraja kriti in Sindhu Kanada (Adi), not attempted by many, but with a lyrical quality that tugs at the heart-strings got enriched through the vocalist's treatment.Charged with feeling, he seemed to be yearning for the grace of the Goddess as he spelt out the lines, neevu brovakunte yevaru brothuru&#8230;. Shobillu Saptaswara in Jaganmohini a straight rendition jolted us from the aura of divinity as if to show the pathway (music) to godhead. With his deep and sonorous voice the artist was able to endow each kriti with a dimension in accordance to its inherent cadence. Dikshitar's challenging and highly esoteric Maaye twam yaahi&#8230; in Tarangini was handled by Daniel with mesmeric touch. His alapana scaled the lovely raga in its full scale and his tonal equanimity was in total blend with the alliterative and highly lofty lyric. The swara kalpana with its meandering flow of syllables showcased the vocalist's innovative excellence. Violinist Komanduri Ananta Souri Rajan gave a befitting replay in fine tunes. Daniel chose to present Kantamani (Paalinthuvo, paalimpavo&#8230;) another pristine and pleasing kriti as his principle number again deviating from the customary norm. A fairly elaborate alapana, which by now proved to be the vocalist's highlight, set the tone to this serene song.The spirituality in Paramardhamagu nija margamuna&#8230; got enriched with the neraval and the subsequent manodharmam which began smooth and short gradually spinning into extensive swarakalpana. At no point of time did the artist display speed tactics straying away from the intrinsic nature of the raga to gain popularity. He was in full control of the raga and its nuances. The &#8216;tani' (percussion solo) by mridangam artist B. Janardan was steady and compelling without being loud. In fact, all through the recital he took to subdued tones staying tuned to the vocalist. Palukutenala talli a popular Annamacharya keertana in Abheri was as sweetly sung as the raga itself. The tarangam set to Jhonpuri raga upheld the rhythmic and considerably lighter side of the artist as was the Ramadas number Adigo Bhadradri in Varali.The penultimate Krsna nee begane baaro&#8230; brought cheers from the audience while the concluding nagumomu galavaani naa manoharuni&#8230; another rare piece with a sloka as mangalam complimented the exceptional repertoire hosted by Saptaswara Cultural Organisation and Sri Thyagaraja Gana Sabha at the latter venue.
