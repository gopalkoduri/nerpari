VStarting with &#8216;Sangitha Devathe Saraswathi&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla-Adi) Sumithra&#8217;s voice took some time to settle down. The niraval and swaras that followed were rather tame.  &#8216;Kothandapani&#8217; (Valaji-Rupakam), however, was better.The Begada alapana was fresh with a profusion of rakti phrases, particularly in the higher octave which seemed to be the strength of Sumitra. H.N.Bhaskar&#8217;s replies were equally interesting. &#8216;Tharunam Idai Kai Viduveno&#8217; was presented with verve. An ideal dance piece indeed. Using the raga&#8217;s name for alapana Sumitra presented Mohana Kalyani in a slow paced manner with long karvais preceding &#8216;En Thai Nee Irukka,&#8217; rich in lyrical content. Being a Thursday, Sumitra&#8217;s choice of a kriti on Sri Sathya Sai Baba in Natakurinji (&#8216;Eppadi En Agam&#8217;) was apt.The detailed alapana of Thodi was within aesthetic limits, with the niraval and swaras in the right proportion.B. Ganapthyraman (mridangam) and S. Karthick (ghatam) combined very well with their unobtrusive playing. Their understanding was perfect, enlivening the concert with interesting patterns.&#8216;Ezhil Tiru Meni&#8217; (Brindavanasaranga), &#8216;Aadinale Kannoonjal&#8217; in a ragamalika, &#8216;Padayo&#8217; (Nadanamakriya) and &#8216;Vinoppa Villiputhur&#8217; (Madyamavathi) were the concluding pieces.
