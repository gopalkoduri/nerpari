VRahul Sharma represents that contemporary breed of classical musician who is not shy to experiment. This time he has teamed up with Georges Kazazian who plays the Egyptian oud. The other known name who has contributed to the effort is Sunidhi Chauhan, with her versatile voice.The first song, which has Sunidhi's vocals, &#8216;Marhaba Jaanam,' while melodious, has a pop-filmy feel, especially with lyrics like &#8216;Ishq mohabbat.'There is also a remix version of it, which is&#8230;well, what do you expect from a remix? It is also recorded in instrumental format. This is one of the more agreeable of the tracks.Another disco kind of track with vocals (by Rahul) is &#8216;Nights in Cairo.' Not the sort of thing you can hear again and again.In between there is &#8216;Meeting by the Nile,' an instrumental track that starts off gently, then builds pace and goes into a pleasant refrain with the santoor and the oud complementing each other. There are also the picturesquely named &#8216;Taj Mahal' and &#8216;Sunrise on the Sphinx.' The former again is pleasant, but not unforgettable. &#8216;Sunrise on the Sphinx' begins with a desert aura and then gets mixed with digital beats. It has an interesting use of strings here and there. &#8216;Sheesha and Jazz' is another piece in this varied jigsaw, with some contemplative, melodious bits and male vocals. But its instrumentals are more interesting than its vocal bits. &#8216;The Pyramids' composed by Kazazian makes for good listening, with tarana type vocal interventions.While the &#8216;Marhaba' versions, &#8216;Taj Mahal' and &#8216;Nights in Cairo' are composed by Rahul, the others are by Kazazian. Pleasant may be a good word for lounge listening, but is it enough to make an album stand out on a crowded world music stage?A Meeting by The NileA contemporary fusion albumSa Re Ga MaPrice: Rs.299
