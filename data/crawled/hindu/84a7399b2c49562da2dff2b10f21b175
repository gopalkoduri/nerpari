VGanabharathi in Mysore had arranged Smitha Shrikiran's flute recital suitably accompanied by two more young artistes, H.M. Smitha (violin) and Radhesh(mridanga).The flautist entertained the audience exhibiting good control over the instrument and the overall melodic atmosphere remained consistent at all levels, without showing any slackness at any moment. At the same time, it does not altogether mean that the concert was climactically elevated.Lathangi provided excellent scope\u000afor her to exhibit proficiency backed\u000awith composure and commitment. A\u000asystematic alapana and taana followed\u000aby the pallavi "Mathangi Marakathangi"\u000afound many strains of\u000apleasing embellishments in the swaraprastara\u000asections when she expanded\u000ain the pentatonic ragamalika\u000a- Hindola, Sumanisaranjani and\u000aShudha Saveri sequence. Transitions\u000abetween the ragas were smooth and\u000aimpressive. "Eranapai" of Patnam\u000aSubrahmanya Iyer (varna, Todi),\u000aChowdaiah's "Prasanna Ganapathe"\u000a(Bahudhari), Bellary Sheshagiri\u000aAchar's "Sharadambam Bhajeham"\u000a(Divyamani), Dikshitar's "Shri\u000aLakshmi Varaham" (Abhogi) could\u000ahave been more inspiring, though\u000aher unassuming style made way for\u000athe pleasing and majestic ragas to\u000abeam forth their inherent moods.Nadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha\u000ahonoured Sitalakshmi Venkateshan,\u000aa veteran musician well-known for\u000aher varied interests in upholding the\u000aIndian music tradition , by conferring\u000aon her the title Nadabrahma.\u000aThe Sabha bestowed the title, Nadakishora\u000aon the young singer Vinay\u000aSharva, the winner of the competition\u000aNadakishorotsava, which was a\u000aplatform to pick the best. Marking\u000athe occasion, Chitra Shrikrishna\u000asang accompanied by Veena Suresh\u000a(violin), Radhesh (mridanga) and Vijayanand\u000a(morsing). She was successful\u000ain infusing the desired\u000aemotions into the compositions. Yet,\u000ain spite of the fact that the artiste was\u000aendowed with a freely blooming manodharma,\u000ashe could not realise her\u000aimagination to the extent to which\u000ashe could have for lack of felicity. She\u000astarted her recital with Patnam Subrahmanya\u000aIyer's varna - "Eranapai"\u000ain Todi. Brisk or bold vocal approach,\u000awhich suited the varna, could not\u000ajustify a composition like "Shri Ramachandro\u000aRakshatu" of Muthuswamy\u000aDikshitar composed in\u000aShriranjani.The above observation was evident\u000ain other presentations too -\u000a"Sidhivinayakam Seveham" (Mohana\u000aKalyani - Muthayya Bhagavathar)\u000aand "Parama Purusha Nirupama"\u000a(Shanmukhapriya - Annamacharya)\u000afor instance.Had she breathed the same\u000awarmth, which characterised Vasudevachar's\u000a"Marachithivemo" (Purvikalyani),\u000ainto her other selects, she\u000awould have raised the entire concert\u000ato commendable heights. A pleasing\u000aalapana in both the madhya and the\u000ataara sthayis with crisp and sprightly\u000agamakas, an absorbing neraval at\u000a"Patitapavana Neeve", and an equally\u000ainvigorating swaraprastara constituted\u000athe finer sides of this rendition.Yet, at times, the swaras lost their\u000abalance. "Devanake Indra" of Swathy\u000aTirunal (Darbari Kanada) was another\u000ahighlight of the concert, which\u000aconcluded with a tillana.
