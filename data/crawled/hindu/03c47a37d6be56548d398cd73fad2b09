VShankar, who was under the tutelage of the late Raja Bhavu Sontakki of the Gwalior gharana and currently learning from Pt. Parameshwar Hegde, is a singer gifted with a solid bass voice and his essays in the mandhra sthayi were soothing.&#8220;Gayiye Ganapathy Jaga Vandana&#8221; (Tulsidas-Teen taal) was presented in Marwa which was preceded by a brief alap with accent on Dha, Ni, Ri. The audience were already in a trance. Bhajan Bina (Mishra Shivaranjani-Kabir-Dhumali) was the next. The effortless ease with which Shankar traversed from the mandhra to thara sthayi with ease, indicated hard work and hours ofriyaz. Veteran Pt. Vasanth Kanakapur on the harmonium was a perfect foil to him. &#8220;Bhajare Muraliya Bhaje,&#8221; a sort of a ragamalika set in Bhajan teka was fast paced.  The pakhawaj style of playing adopted by Gurumurthy Vaidya on the tabla for the &#8220;Shiva Shadakshara Sthuthi&#8221; in raag Bhaatiyar was impressive.The last piece was the highlight. It was a soulful and emotional rendering of all the charanams of Vande Mataram (Bankim Chandra Chatterjee) in Raag Desh. Shanbough requested the entire audience to stand up for it and they sang along.
