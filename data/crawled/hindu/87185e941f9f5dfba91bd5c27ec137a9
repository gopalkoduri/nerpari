VB. RAMADEVIThe rasikas of Coimbatore were treated to two fulfilling concerts recently in connection with the aradhanas of  Tyagaraja and Purandaradasa at the Bhavan's premises.The former was arranged under the Smt. S.A.Kaveri Ammal and Smt. Sowdamini Rajan Memorial Endowment while the J. Sakharam Rao Memorial Endowment had organised the latter. The Tyagaraja aradhana concert was presented by Palghat G.K.Sivaraman.Marked by clear diction and emotional involvement, Bangalore Shubha Ramaswamy (disciple of R.K.Padmanabha) sang along with her daughter, H.R.Krithi, the following day, paying homage to Purandaradasa.Impressive line-upThe concert that began with `Valachi Vachi' (navaragamalika varnam) slowly gained momentum and became more and more impressive as one song followed another in quick succession.Thought-provoking ugabhogas `Sharanu Belagane' in Nalinakanti, `Nama Sankeerthane' in Dhanyasi and `Sari Bandane' in Vasantha, not much heard in these parts, impressed with their freshness.Sriranjani (`Srinivasa Enna Bittu') and Hemavathi (`Neene Dhayalo Nirmala Chitta Govinda') were treated elaborately.Bhairavi occupied the main stage with a vivid portrayal preceding the delectable kriti, `Odibaarayya Vaikuntapathi' in which the composer visualises the Almighty Lord (Vaikuntapathi) as a   child.The appropriate ugabhogas preceding the kritis were thought-provoking. While the daughter endeared herself to the audience with her pleasant smile and poise, the mother proved her mettle as a veteran with her rich voice, controlled rendering and evocative presentation.S. Usha on the violin, R. Jayaprakash on the mridangam, G.Suresh on the ghatam, N. Ganesh on the kanjira (all  from Coimbatore) and Palani K.V.Arumugham on the morsing  provided able support.Bottom Template Starts
