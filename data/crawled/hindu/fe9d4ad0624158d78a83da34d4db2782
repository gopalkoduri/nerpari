Subramaniam (ghatam) and Satish (keyboard).The programme is impressively put on the rails with Papanasam Sivan's Hamsadhwani song `Mooladharamoorthi' on Ganesha with brief sketches of the raga and brisk swaraprastaras. Imaginative musical pieces by Ravindran in melting melodies Mand, Brindavanasaranga and Sumanesaranjani in varied talams are ear-friendly. The lyrics in praise of Sri Sathya Sai Baba and Guru Raghavendra have been given emotional oral expression.The concluding section Asian melodies, consists of fascinating tunes associated with folk music.
