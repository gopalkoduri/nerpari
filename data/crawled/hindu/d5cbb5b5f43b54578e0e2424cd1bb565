VR. Visweswaran, legatee of the legendary tradition of the charismatic musician, G.N.Balasubramaniam, was his nephew. Trained in vocal music under his mother Rajeswari Ranganathan, he was an adept veena player being the disciple of R. Pichumani Iyer. \u000aAlthough academically well qualified as a chartered accountant, his passion for fine arts prompted him to pursue music &#8211; Carnatic, Hindustani and Western. He and his wife Chitra, renowned Bharatnatyam dancer, have made a sizeable contribution to the field of Indian music and dance.The santoor also became a medium of Visweswaran&#8217;s artistic expression and he was an acknowledged exponent of the instrument, benefiting from the tutelage of Pt. Shivkumar Sharma. The Chidambaram Academy of Fine Arts, instituted by the couple, has produced many talented dancers who have made a mark in the national and international Diaspora.The first album in this pack comprises songs suitable to a full-fledged dance margam and have been sung by Visweswaran. GNB&#8217;s &#8216;Varavallabha Ramana&#8217; in Hamsadhwani gently woos  the rasika with the singer&#8217;s soft, pleasant voice literally caressing the words. &#8216;Anjali&#8217; extolling Lord Ganapati also rendered in Hamsadhwani, and Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s beautiful Pada varnam in Charukesi with melodious niraval or sanchari and gripping solkattus by Chitra are an electric blend of melody and rhythm.The Atana padam in Tamil with a brief sketch of the raga and expressed with clarity of enunciation, is reflective of an artiste in quest of aesthetic, musical fulfilment. &#8216;Chikkavane&#8217; a ragamalika of Purandaradasa in Yamunakalyani, Brindavani, Sindhubhairavi and Chenchurutti is an uplifting experience doing full justice to the inherent mood of the lyric.A tillana in Rasikapriya, the 72nd melakarta is rare, Visweswaran&#8217;s creation is the work of a musician of substance and refined composing skills. The emotion-charged narration by Chitra does bring up a lump in one&#8217;s throat.The santoor is an extremely difficult instrument in the North Indian system, and to produce rewarding, purposeful music demandsriyaazat optimum levels with enduring focus and commitment. Raag Bageshri has been a winner in the Hindustani discipline, and every time it is heard, haunting melody pervades the entire environment. Visweswaran&#8217;s masterly display of the raag in Alap, Jhod and Jhala without misplacing a single note is crafted with the expertise of a master sculptor. The gat in Rupak and Teen Tal with sensitive rhythmic accompaniment on the tabla is proof that Visweswaran&#8217;s music is not only from the mind, but also straight from the heart.Dance Margam songsR.
