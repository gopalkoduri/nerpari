VRajalakshmi Audio, Coimbatore.Sumitra NitinClassical CD (Price: Rs.100)The artist&#8217;s grandmother Ananthalaksmi Sadagopan has scored the music for the songs  featured in this disc.Sumitra is a sensitive singer and her approach reveals her refined taste for classical values.Her renderings are marked by &#8216;Azhutham&#8217; and there is an overall &#8216;Vishranthi&#8217; in her presentations.The songs featured in this disc are compositions only in Tamil. The opening number is melodious,  suitable for a concert beginning, and in this case it happens to be Kedaram (&#8216;Gurutanda&#8217;).Following this are compositions in Sahana (&#8216;Kaana Vendamo&#8217;), Mohanakalyani (&#8216;En Thai Nee&#8217;), Nattakurinji (&#8216;Eppadi Enagam&#8217;), Amrutavarshini (&#8216;Kaliyil Kankanda&#8217;) and Begada (&#8216;Tharunam Idai&#8217;).Sumitra uses the raga&#8217;s name instead of akarams for her Mohanakalyani alapana. This sounds well rehearsed and the manodharma, which one would normally associate with a raga vinyasa, is missing. The vocalist renders the song and the kalpanaswaras in Mohanakalyani with a fine finesse. Tisra Nadai sahitya appendages feature in the Kedaram and Sahana numbers and the Amrutavarshini number has a Khanda Nadai sahitya passage towards the close of the charanam.A good quality Thodi alapana is offered by Sumitra. The alapana paves way for the Rupaka tala composition &#8216;Tarakam Verevariayya.&#8217; The rest of the compositions sung are in Adi tala. The niraval and swaras are sung with confidence and maturity. The kuraippu swarams however fail to make an impact as the time management by the artist for this segment falls short of her otherwise professional approach.The closing numbers are in Brindavanasaranga and Nadanamakriya apart from a swing song in Ragamalika set to Khamas, Dhanyasi, Shanmukhapriya and Mohanam.The brigas during the Mohanam section of the ragamalika are joyous to listen to. The accompanists H.N.Bhaskar (violin ), J.Vaidyanathan (mridangam ) and S.Karthik (ghatam ) have offered the required support.
