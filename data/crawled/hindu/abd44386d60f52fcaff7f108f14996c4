VTheme-based concerts are no longer a novelty. One has seen quite a few Yaman Utsavs and Malhar Utsavs organised from time to time. However, it was perhaps for the first time that a two-day music festival focusing on &#8220;Kalyan-Kauns-Kanhda&#8221; was planned around a cluster of evening and night ragas. Sabrang Society tried out this experiment last week at Indira Gandhi Cultural Centre, Noida, and presented promising vocalist Kaivalya Kumar Gurav and top-ranking violinist N. Rajam in the concluding session of the festival. While the effort was worthy of appreciation, the reason touted out by the organisers that ragas belonging to these ragangas are not generally heard at music concerts, was patently untrue.Kaivalya Kumar Gurav is one of the fast rising stars on the firmament of Hindustani classical music. He hails from Karnataka's Dharwad region that can boast of producing some of the stalwarts of the Hindustani classical music &#8212; Sawai Gandharva, Mallikarjun Mansur, Gangubai Hangal, Bhimsen Joshi, Kumar Gandharva and Basavraj Rajaguru. He was initiated into music by his father Sangameshwar Guru who had learnt music by his father Ganpatrao Gurav, a student of two legendary vocalists of the 20th Century &#8212;Bhaskarbua Bakhle and Abdul Karim Khan. It was Abdul Karim Khan whose 78 rpm record of Jhinjhoti thumri moved an eleven-year-old Bhimsen Joshi so much that he left home in search of a guru who would teach him to sing like him.Kaivalya Kumar is not only an inheritor of the Kirana tradition, he styles himself a little too much after Bhimsen Joshi. He chose raga Puriya Kalyan to begin his recital and sang a bada khayal, &#8220;Hovan Lagi Sanjh&#8221; and followed it up with two medium-fast and fast chhota khayals, &#8220;More Ghar Aaja Aaja&#8221; and &#8220;Banna Aayo Re&#8221;, the last one being a traditional bandish of Nemat Khan &#8216;Sadarang' who adorned the court of the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah Rangila. When kalyan raganga is mingled with the uttaranga of Puriya, it gives birth to the hybrid raga Puriya Kalyan. While kalyan ang makes it imperative to use shuddh rishabh, Puriya demands the judicious use of komal rishabh. The bada khayal sung by Kaivalya Kumar was in fact a composition of the Agra gharana musicologist S. N. Ratanjankar in which the cluster of teevra madhyam-shuddha dhaivat-teevra madhyam-shuddha gandhar gave it a special character. While Kaivalya impressed with his taiyari and sapaat taans, his taan patterns were very much like that of Bhimsen Joshi. He concluded his recital with a rarely heard raga Bhimkauns without announcing its name. The bandish &#8220;Aayo Mahdumaas&#8221;, celebrated the advent of Basant. He showed promise but also the dangers of cloning a great maestro like Bhimsen Joshi.Virtuosity on the violinN. Rajam is known for her chaste classicism, sober temperament and complete mastery over violin. A student of the great Omkarnath Thakur, she plays his gayaki on her instrument with a dazzling display of virtuosity as well as a refined aesthetic sense. Since Kaivalya Kumar ended his recital with Bhimkauns, she decided to approach Darbari Kanhda. The quivering komal gandhar and the due attention to madra saptak captivated the listeners. True to her guru's teachings, she tried her best to reproduce the kaku-bheda device of Omkarnath Thakur and enthralled the discerning music lovers.She followed it up with a riveting Malkauns, choosing the famous Meerabai pad &#8220;Pag Ghunghroo Baandh Meera Naachi Re&#8221;. She faithfully played her guru's interpretation, even tweaking the word &#8216;naachi' in the mukhda. Rajam demonstrated to the listeners the difference between gatkaari and tantrakaari styles, thus enhancing the musical content of her recital.As she has spent a better part of her life in Banaras, she concluded her recital with a Banarasi Hori, a most apt choice for this time of the year. Akram Khan of Ajrada gharana offered adroit accompaniment on the tabla and enhanced the aesthetic appeal of the performance.The organisation of the event left much to be desired. There was hardly any publicity, resulting in a most unhappy situation where a top-ranking musician like N. Rajam had to play for an audience of less than 40. The organisers themselves arrived at the auditorium five minutes after the scheduled time of the concert.
