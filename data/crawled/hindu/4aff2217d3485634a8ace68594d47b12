VA sitar recital of Hindustani music was featured by Visakha Music and Dance Academy at its auditorium Kalabharathi. The artiste Subrata De, a teacher-cum-performer at Indian Cultural Centre, Bangkok impressed the audience. He without dwelling deep into most of the essentially intricate requirements of wholesome exposition of Hindustaani style of classical music, played euphoniously .He started with rag keeravani and played a composition in bilambit, madhyam and dhrut laya in Teental, suffixed with sargam replete. The titillating toras in all the tempos and in all the three octaves was soothing to the ears. He ended each phase of the sargam with lilting theehais thus proving himself to be a creator of euphony.He played another composition on similar lines, in ragmalika and it comprised of bhagasree, peelu, sivranjani and desh.On the audience&#8217;s request, he played a composition in Sohini and concluded the recital on a delightful note with a composition in Ahirbhairavi.Parthaparatim Das from Kolkatta provided him with splendid rhythmic support on the tabla. Secretary of the Academy G.R.K. Prasad (Rambabu), later felicitated the artistes and proposed a vote of thanks.
