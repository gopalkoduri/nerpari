VTallapakkam Annamacharya (1408-1503) (?) was the earliest composers of Telugu kirtanas and also the trendsetter of the Bhajana Paddhati. He was the first ever composer to divide his' into Pallavi (refrain) and charanams (Stansas). He composed a phenomenal number of 32,000 songs, out of which 14,000 are available. They were all engraved in copper plates, and stored in a small room within the temple premises of Lord Venkateswara at Tirumalai.His compositions have been basically classified as Aadhyatma Sankeertanam (spiritual compositions) and Sringara Sankeertanams (erotic compositions).This CD album of four  discs gives an introduction to Annamacharya, the Rituals and Festivals at Tirumala, Sringara Sankeertanams and Sanskrit compositions with scholarly insights into the life, music and devotion of Annamacharya by Dr. Pappu Venugopal Rao, who is erudition personified in many spheres. His in-depth analysis of Annamacharya's work, is more of a `Tapas' than any casual, fleeting interest in the subject.The rendering of rare and popular songs set to music by distinguished musicians, by Vidwans Nedunuri Krishnamurthy, Narimella Balakrishna Prasad, Balamurali Krishna and Mandapaka Sri Devi with singular emphasis on melody, emotion, bhava and bhakti is truly vintage claret. This superb effort of Dr. Pappu Venugopala Rao is undoubtedly a collector's item.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
