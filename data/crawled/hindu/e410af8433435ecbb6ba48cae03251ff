VOruganti Naga Saileswari gave a vocal concert for Swara Jhari Sabha of Vijayawada at Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram. An experienced singer, she has many achievements to her credit, including a doctorate in music from Andhra University. She is a disciple of R. Vasundhara Devi.Naga Saileswari began her concert with a varnam in Bahudari composed by Lalgudi Jayaraman and followed it withSri Maha Ganapathiof Muthuswami Dikshitar in Gowla. Her voice has a peculiar timbre. Though it was well-suited in the manodharmam aspects, in some places, particularly in the higher octave, it went out of tune.However, her delineations of Revathi &#8212;Maha Deva Sambho, a composition of Tanjavur Sankaran, and Kharaharapriya (Chakkani Raja Margamu) &#8212; were enjoyable and reflected rich raga bhavas. The last one was the main item in Naga Sailaswari&#8217;s concert and it was pleasingly presented with fine kalpana swaras, which revealed the singer&#8217;s command over the laya and its intricacies.B.V. Durga Bhavani, a senior violinist and a staff artiste of Vijayawada Akashvani, gave Naga Saileswari faithful support and her raga essays of Poorvi Kalyani and Kharaharapriya were hauntingly melodious. B.V.S. Prasad, a staff artiste of Akashvani, presented a fine tani on the mridangam and he was supported well by M. Haribabu on the ghatam.
