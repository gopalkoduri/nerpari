VNada Inbam and Parampara presented a video show on Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. It had been filmed when Semmangudi, on the occasion of his 90th birthday, visited vainika Vidya Sankar&#8217;s house. Semmangudi had made it clear that he would accept her \u000ainvitation only if it was not a public function. S.V. Krishnan was one of the invitees on that occasion. So it was appropriate that the video film should be screened at the Raga Sudha Hall.Many events have been organised in the city over the past few weeks, to celebrate Semmangudi&#8217;s centenary. What was unique about the function at Raga Sudha, was that one could hear Semmangudi talk on Semmangudi, as the compere put it.Semmangudi talks about his early days in Semponkudi. (Semponkudi became Semmangudi). He recalls the knowledge of music that the then head of the Tiruvavaduturai Mutt had. He recalls Konerirajapiram&#8217;s Bhairavi, as one of the best he has heard. He speaks of the greatness of Ariyakudi, and of how Muthiah Bhagavatar&#8217;s music had both lakshya and lakshana.He says it was the nagaswaram that nurtured our music. If an atheist had heard the nagaswara vidwans play during the Gopura vaasal deepa aradhanai, he would have changed his mind. So divine was their music, observes Semmangudi.Once in Peddanaickanpalayam in Salem district, Dakshinamurthy Pillai asked him to sing.  Semmangudi had feasted on mangoes and that had  affected his voice.  &#8220;And when I sang,  Pillai advised me never to sing again. I was so upset, that I practised with a vengeance. That is bad too, for it spoils your voice. Everything in moderation, including sadhakam,&#8221; says Semmangudi.He is glad that he was a part of the Gurukula system. &#8220;We were willing servants to our gurus. Once I saw Dakshinamurthy Pillai vent his irritation on his disciple Dakshinamurthy Achari by beating him. Had I been his disciple, I would have run away. So hard did the blows fall!&#8221; he reminisces.He recounts an interesting story about how Udayarpalayam Yuvaraja Bhoopathy, came in search of a poor vidwan, and honoured him. Such was the respect musicians commanded in those days.  &#8220;Today music has become a business. Yet I have the confidence that our music will survive all these onslaughts,&#8221; he says.He rues the fact that students, with no idea of their limitations, seek gurus, and expect the latter to make vidwans out of them.There was this student, who couldn&#8217;t imbibe anything he was taught. And he told Semmangudi, &#8220;You must make me a vidwan. You are being paid to do that.&#8221; And the stalwart replied, &#8220;You, young man, are my guru!&#8221;Semmangudi talks of how irksome he finds modern conveniences, such as the fan and the mike. The mike is a devil,  according to him.The video presentation had Semmangudi talk about a lot of things, with his wry humour enlivening the proceedings, the poor audio quality notwithstanding.But the technology to fix these technical flaws is available, and when done, the video  would enrich any music archive. The programme started half an hour late, but it was well worth the wait.
