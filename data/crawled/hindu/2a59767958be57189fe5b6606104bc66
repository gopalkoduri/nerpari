VS. VINAYA KUMARMystical even in childhood, young Subramanya, as he was then called, showed himself to be poorly attuned to a worldly life, even after he was pressurised into marrying the daughter of a wealthy man named Thanu Iyer who lived in Karamana in Thiruvananthapuram. Thus began his association with Karamana which continued till his death there in 1900.In the course of those years, he composed around 2,000 songs, not including hundreds that his unsympathetic father-in-law is supposed to have destroyed. His devotion to Lord Siva earned him the appellation of Neelakanta Sivan.The Neelakanta Sivan Sangeetha Sabha of Thiruvananthapuram was established 31 years ago on the initiative of the late Venuganam Janardana Iyer.  Under its auspices, most of the big names in Carnatic music have performed in the capital city before crowds of discerning music lovers.Till a few years ago, the music recitals were conducted in a cozy, temporary thatched shed right opposite the Siva temple in the heart of the Karamana gramam. But now the venue has been shifted to a new building named Sree Sathya Vageeswara Swami Japa Dhyana Bhajana Mandapam. This appears to be a regrettable change as the acoustic ambience of the thatched shed was better suited for listening to music than the unpleasantly resonating hall.Six-day feteThis year, the Sabha observes the 106th Samadhi day of the mystic composer with a six-day-long fete from July 19 to 24 Sudha Reghunathan begins the events with her concert on July 19, and the festival comes to an end with a vocal recital by Trichur V. Ramachandran. Other artistes appearing on stage this year include  T.M. Krishna, Subha Ganesan, Perumbavur C.S. Sajeev and the Mambalam sisters R. Vijayalekshmi and R. Chithra.From this year onwards, the Venuganam Memorial Prize has been instituted in honour of the founder of the Sabha, and will be awarded to a young  musician annually selected through a competition organised for the purpose.Bottom Template Starts
