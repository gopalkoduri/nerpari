VWhen the septuagenarian B.S. Vijayaraghavan sings, sublime radiance illuminates the hall,  for his drishti rests more on the essence of music rather than on its form. Ganabharathi had arranged his concert in memory of the musician- composer, Chakrako\u000adi Narayana Shastry. Belonging to the lineage of B. Devendrappa, Vijayaraghavan plays veena, gotuvadya, jalatarang and violin too, in both Carnatic and Hindustani styles.Rightly, dignity in his person, decorum in his presence, simplicity in his bearing and gravity in his scholarly expressions brought home to the audience the musical splendour of the royal courts.The learned artiste, exercising tenacious grip over the laya, carried the varna, &#8220;Neranammi&#8221; (Kaanada - Ramanad Shrinivas Iyengar) to a consummating completion, honouring both its lyrical significance and musical grandeur.Maintaining the same grit, he expatiated Kaanada (&#8220;Shri Gananatham Bhajare&#8221;, Dikshitar), not a moment was lost on the haphazard wanderings and cursory manipulations. Neraval at &#8220;Ragadweshadi Rahitha&#8221; led to vajandar swarakalpana and a feather-touch thaniyavarthana.With mood- oriented exceptional clarity and diction he presented &#8220;Shri Gururamanam&#8221; (Bahudari - C.N. Shastri) and &#8220;Brahmandavalaye&#8221; (Maand - Shri Jayachamaraja Wadiyar.) The mature intellect expressed itself in compositions opulent in Bhakti, Jnana and Vairagya: &#8220;Paramatma Aarindarive&#8221; (Maand &#8211; C.N. Shastri) and &#8220;Maathu Mounagalinda&#8221; (Bhairavi &#8211; Hindustani). Melody and tranquility thus reigning, Veena Suresh&#8217;s violin hummed, G.S. Ramanujan&#8217;s mridanga whispered and B. Shashishankar&#8217;s ghata murmured.Rama Ramayya&#8217;s vocal concert at Shrithi Manjari Pratishtana had many interesting features. She was accompanied by H.K. Narasimha Murthy (violin) and H.L. Shivashankaraswamy (mridanga). Most of the compositions were of the vaggeyakaras of Mysore-Muthayya Bhagavathar and Bidaram Krishnappa &#8211; characteristically these krithis have in-built lively chitteswaras.Possessed with a delicate voice which gets thin in the taara sthayi,  she commenced with Muthayya Bhagavathar&#8217;s varna, &#8220;Shri Rajamathangi&#8221; (Shuddha Dhanyasi), imparting warmth and stability.&#8220;Dasharathe Ninne Kori&#8221; (Rishabhapriya- Bidaram Krishnappa) may here be considered in the first instance. While elaborating the raga, she managed herself admirably without  slipping herself into strong fields of either Lathangi or Shanamukhapriya &#8211; even fast paces not suffering any setback on this score.It also featured neraval at Kamalabhava followed by swarakalpana in the required three sthayis, carefully retaining all the essential features of an ideal approach. &#8220;Vandeham Jagadvallabham&#8221; (Hamsadhwani - Annamacharya), &#8220;Maanamu Kavalannu&#8221; (Shahana- Muthayya Bhagavathar) and the one discussed earlier- all have passages of chitteswaras. Appending all these presentations once again with improvised swaras amounted to superfluity. A neraval and swaraprasthara to Shyamashastri&#8217;s Swarajati, Kamakshi Amba (gamakas were inadequate) was an over embellishment.Some areas needed to be in strict tune with the shruthi. Average speed oscillated between medium and the fast tempos inclining more towards the latter. Consequently, &#8220;Samaana Rahite&#8221; (Saranga Tarangini &#8211; G.N.B), for example, lost its charm, and appeared messy.
