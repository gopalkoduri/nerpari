VPollachi Tamizhisai Sangam celebrated its 39 {+t} {+h} anniversary and the centenary of Puduthottam PRMS Ramanathan Chettiar (father of RM. Vellayappan, secretary, Pollachi Tamizhisai Sangam) with harikatha, music and dance recitals at Mahatma Gandhi Mandapam, Pollachi.Kalyanapuram Aravamudhachariyar, exponent of harikatha, was honoured with the title, &#8216;Arunkathai Mamani' during the inaugural function that was presided over by SKM Mayilanandhan, chairman, SKM Industries.Aravamudhachariyar's musical discourses on &#8216;Kulasekarar Kanda Raman', &#8216;Tyagarajar Kanda Raman' and &#8216;Soodikkodutha Sudarkkodi' for three consecutive days proved his mastery.His hold over Sanskrit, Telugu and Tamil and his ability to sing in a voice well-aligned to sruti, won him great admiration. He converted his musical discourse on Tyagaraja into an oral dissertation with extensive quotations from the devout works of the Azhwars, Kambar and Valmiki. He successfully convinced the audience that Tyagaraja has drawn substantial inspiration from the divine compositions of these saintly composers. He was ably accompanied by Thiruvallur Parthasarathy on the violin and Thiruvananthapuram Gopalakrishnan on the mridangam.Impressive renditionMaharajapuram S. Ramachandran's pure, pristine music filled the hearts of the rasikas with peace. The very first kriti &#8216;Sri Vaathapi Ganapathiye Un Thiruvadiye Charanam' in Sahana (Papanasam Sivan) was very impressive. Ramachandran maintained the tempo till the end. The rare composition &#8216;Karathinil Velendhum Kanthan' by Surajananda was presented after a detailed delineation of the raga. The centrepiece was also very different.The Thevarams are usually sung as viruttams towards the end of the concert. But Ramachandran sang two thevarams of Thirunavukkarasar, &#8216;Vaananai Mathi Soodiya' and &#8216;Veeranai Vidamundaanai,' set to tune in Kiravani as a regular kriti. The niraval for &#8216;Veeranai..' and the swarakalpanas following it were delightful.The lighter session had the usual favourites such as &#8216;Sri Chakraraja Simhasaneshwari' &#8216;Chinnanjiru Kiliye' and &#8216;Entha Velaiyum Kanthavelai.' He concluded it with &#8216;Bho Shambho.'Veteran accompanists Nagai Muralidharan (violin), Mannargudi A. Easwaran (mridangam) and Coimbatore A. Mohanram (ghatam) joined Ramachandran in giving a wholesome aural treat.
