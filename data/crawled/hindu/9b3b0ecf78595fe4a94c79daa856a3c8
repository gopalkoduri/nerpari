VFestivity was in the air as Delhi turned into a cultural capital during the Commonwealth Games held recently. At the Delhi Classical Musical Festival, one of the songs sung by popular Chennai-based artiste Aruna Sairam was truly reflective of the festive mood. &#8220;Kadanakudukala ragame&#8221; in raga Kadanakutuhalam which takes a &#8216;vakra swara' pattern (zigzag notes), was enthralling and pushed the cosmopolitan audience at Kamani auditorium into celebration mode. It is said one who sings or listens to this raga gets a feeling of utmost happiness. Literally, the performing artistes as well as the audience were in a jubilant mood.Aruna started off her concert on a lively note with the verse &#8220;Namachivaya vazhga, nadhan thal vazhga immaippozhuduhum en nenjil ninggadhan thal vazhga&#8221; from &#8220;Thiruvachakkam&#8221; in the form of a scintillating viruttam and followed it up with the well-known composition of Gopalakrishna Bharati, &#8220;Sabapatikku veru deivam&#8221; in raga Abhogi. She embarked on the improvisation techniques even while in the opening piece. The neraval of the phrase &#8220;Orudaram Sivachidambaram yendru sonnal podume&#8221; and the subsequent swaraprastaras were captivating and were greeted with thunderous applause.Sensing a diverse audience, that included foreigners too, the artiste was constantly making short speeches in between songs for better appreciation of what she was presenting. The emotive aspects of Muttuswami Dikshitar's composition &#8220;Yehi Annapoorne&#8221; in raga Punnagavarali were brought to the fore. Aided by two tanpuras for the shruti, Aruna's music had a telling effect in the auditorium.As her central piece, she took up Tyagaraja's &#8220;Chakkaniraja&#8221; in raga Kharaharapriya. The choice of this composition suited well as it provides adequate scope for detailed raga exposition and is one of the masterpieces of the legendary composer. The song was well presented with due care for the sangatis, and the delineation of the raga was in a detailed manner. Sadly, the delineation lacked that &#8216;classic touch'. Neraval of the phrase &#8220;Kantiki sundaramagu rupame&#8221; from the charanam portion was brief and one felt adequate justice was not done. Nevertheless, the subsequent swaraprastaras were rich in creativity.The post taniavartanam (percussion solo) session was packed with items like shabad and bhajans in Hindustani style seemingly aimed at the cosmopolitan audience. As the slots for Carnatic programmes were very few in this festival, one felt that instead of digressing, senior vocalist could have taken up and showcased items like padam, thiruppugzhal, etc. in this session.Raghavendra Rao on the violin, J. Vaidyanathan on the mridangam and S.V. Ramani on the ghatam provided excellent support in this concert and contributed significantly. Though Rao's exposition of raga Kharaharapriya was mediocre in the initial phases, he gained ground later on and completed fittingly. The taniavartanam in Adi tala by the percussionist was captivating and commanded thunderous audience appreciation. They added value when improvising techniques were being handled. On the whole, an enlivening concert.
