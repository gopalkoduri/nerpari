VA series  of programmes, to celebrate the music and values of M.S. Subbulakshmi, was organised by the Madurai chapter of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, during the birth week of the legendary singer, between September 12 and 16.A lecture-demonstration by piano artist Anil Srinivasan marked  an interesting beginning. Accompanied by Subiksha Rangarajan, the pianist revealed the  lesser known facets of stalwarts such as M.S. Subbulakshmi and Papanasam Sivan, that they were keenly aware of orchestration with a variety of instruments and that they often selected ragas suitable for the piano. M.S.  is said to have listened to the pianist play the songs and structured her sangatis to produce a harmonic effect. No wonder her singing captured the attention of western composers and pianists who orchestrated several of her renditions, including Annamacharya&#8217;s &#8216;Ksheerabdhi Kanyakaku&#8217; in Chenjurutti and Sadasiva Brahmendral&#8217;s &#8216;Broohi Mukundeti.&#8217;Anil went on to make interesting observations. He said,  &#8216;Kurai Onrum Illai&#8217; was set to music on the piano in New York and that &#8216;Katrinile Varum Geetham&#8217; was inspired by a Bengali melody, which was based on Chopin&#8217;s nocturnal chamber piece. Anil Srinivasan had the audience lapping up his words with absorbed attention. He spoke with clarity and played with inspired felicity. Subiksha&#8217;s singing was light and attractive. Her rendering of &#8216;Enneramum&#8217; in Devagandhari was melodious.The expectation created by the success of the first day&#8217;s programme was amply fulfilled by the vocal concert of Lakshmi Rangarajan, the next day. Co-sponsored by Raga Priya, this traditional presentation began with the Atatala Bhairavi varnam, &#8216;Viribhoni.&#8217; &#8216;Rangapura Vihara,&#8217; &#8216;Akilandeswari&#8217; and &#8216;Shambo Mahadeva&#8217; were compellingly nostalgic.Lakshmi&#8217;s alapanas  brought out the intricacies of the ragas, particularly in Abhogi and Sankarabharanam. T.H. Vasantha captured and reflected the nuances while Narayanan on the mridangam provided perfect percussive support. People&#8217;s demands for well-known kritis soared,  with the audience wanting to relish the music and relive the days of M.S.A Bharatanatyam recital on the popular songs of M.S., by Meenakshi Chittaranjan and students of Kaladiksha, Chennai, was presented under the joint patronage of Sri Satguru Sangeetha Samajam. The excellent nattuvangam by Pandanallur Pandiyan combined with the dancer&#8217;s erect posture and restrained energy made the programme worth watching.It began with the original track from &#8216;Savithri&#8217; for which the dancer emoted. This was followed by &#8216;Sada Saranga Nayane&#8217; in Ranjani by  the students,  replete with poses and rhythmic footwork to produce a pleasing effect. The dramatic content in &#8216;Vadavarayai Mathakki,&#8217; which included scenes such as the disrobing of Draupadi and Hiranya vadam, was commendable. While all the students tried to emulate their teacher&#8217;s style, the one who played Hiranya and Duryodhana was particularly successful.Meenakshi and her student scored on abinaya in the enactment of a romantic tryst between Muruga and the young woman in &#8216;Malai Pozhudinile.&#8217;Sangeetha Sivakumar presented a wholesome fare with a good mixture of enthusiasm and energy. Her deep voice is distinct and matches her traditional style of singing. The alapana in varali for &#8216;Maamava Meenakshi&#8217; and the kalpanaswarams sung with &#8216;Sobillu&#8217; are worthy of mention. The favourites of M.S., &#8216;Bhogindra Sayinam&#8217; in Kuntalavarali and &#8216;Jagadodharana&#8217; in Kapi,  were rendered by her. The tani avartanam by Manoj Siva was excellent.Revathi Sankaran&#8217;s kathakalakshepam on the life of M.S.Subbulakshmi, preceded by Kalki Rajendran&#8217;s felicitation,  led to a grand finale on September 16, the doyen&#8217;s  birthday. Conducted in association with Sruthi Arts Academy, Madurai, this programme showcased the multifarious talents of Revathi.Rajendran extolled the virtues of generosity, simplicity and the musical genius of M.S., who learnt from several gurus and yet managed to sound unique and divine.Revathi Sankaran, clad in traditional costume and jewellery of harikatha narrators, introduced herself as Sakku bai, who hailed from a family of traditional story tellers. She also introduced her accompanists, Suresh on the mridangam and Subbu on the harmonium as &#8216;pucca&#8217; vadhyakaras.Her story began with Goddess Parvati gifting a &#8216;manikka veenai&#8217; to mortals in the form of M.S. Subbulakshmi. She then went on to trace the growth in her career as a singing sensation, her marriage, her scholarship in several languages and the part played by Sadasivam as mentor. She interacted  with the audience, encouraging them to sing along with her  as time passed swiftly and delightfully.
