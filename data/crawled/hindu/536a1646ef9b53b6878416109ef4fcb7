VSrinivasan&#8217;s rapport with the instrument  essentially rests on the respect he has for classical values. The ragas of Srinivasan&#8217;s choice (Ritigowla, Yadukulakambodi, Dhanyasi and Kedaragowla) for the evening had a high melodic quotient and his presentations totally eschewed hyperboles.Soft yet emphatic Srininvasan&#8217;s agenda was to distil the  essence  of the ragas. &#8216;Tatvamariya tharama&#8217; in Ritigowla with a well-knit swara passage at &#8216;Mathi Sekaran magane&#8217; paved the way for the imposing Yadukulakhambodi swarajati &#8216;Amba Kamakshi&#8217; by Syama Sastri.The swaras and sahitya emerged eloquently as a steady stream.The Dhanyasi alapana and &#8216;Meena lochani brova,&#8217; another Syama Sastri composition provided Srinivasan the best prospects for slow and sweet rendition.Kedaragowla is always a charmer with its exceptional range; it was well-exploited and the soulful phrases were neatly deployed in the lower region very effectively by the artist in the raga elaboration.&#8216;Tulasi bilva malligadi&#8217; of Tyagaraja was suitable selection with subtle and scholarly niraval and a charming spell of  swaras landing on an interesting korvai.&#8216;Kanja dalaya dakshi&#8217; in Kamalamanohari and the breezy numbers of Darbari Kanada and Sindhubhairavi were apt fillers and closers. Srinivasan&#8217;s playing carries sensitivity, speed and depth. Yet at times the  swiftness makes the swaras fall out of the line. A careful watch and control on this will provide more comfort for the artist in performing strategy.T.V.Vasan  exhibited his prowess on the mridangam and not ghatam with which he is generally associated with. Pudukottai Ramachandran handled the ghatam. Even their right measures of restrained &#8216;pakka vadyam&#8217; sounded a bit voluble for the soft and smooth veena perhaps due to a slight imbalance in the acoustic levels.
