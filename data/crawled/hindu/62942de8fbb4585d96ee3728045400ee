VG. SWAMINATHANMuthuswami Dikshitar's compositions are  tough and demands great skill on the part of the musician, especially the singer. But they give immense pleasure if the grandeur is captured well.  Dikshitar Jayanthi organised by Saraswathi Vaggeyakkara Trust in association with Narada Gana Sabha featured two   concerts of  proficient vocalists &#151;  Varalakshmi Anandakumar and Prema Rangarajan. Both vocalists  treated the rasikas to the not-so-familiar compositions of the legendary composer.Varalakshmi Anandakumar's voice may not have the instant attraction of the extra syrupy tenor; but her full-throated articulation and the manner in which she presented her concert were laudable. `Sarasa Dala Nayana' in Khamas with raga prelude that mostly moved on the upper registers and later the expansive preamble to  Thodi for `Sri Krishnam Bhaja Manasa' were the important items of Varalakshmi's concert.Varalakshmi's Thodi exposition could well be an example for any aspiring  singer on how to develop a raga  for a masterpiece like `Sri Krishnam.' It was neat, tradition-bound,  steady and sonorous with compete emphasis on all regions. Her niraval and swaras at `Sangu Chakra Gada'  were not of the high voltage category but definitely a serenely attractive  exercise. The other choices of Varalakshmi Anandakumar were `Sri Guru Guha Taraya' in Devakriya, `Sundareswaram' (Suddha Vasantha) and `Sri Kamalambika Avava' (Ghanta). Violinist Padma Shankar's versions were as catchy, knowledgeable and impressive as those of Varalakshmi's. Mannargudi N. Subramanian provided an  energetic percussive padding.Commanding voice, perfect clarity in enunciation, and complete conviction in presentation were the hallmarks of Prema Rangarajan's vocal recital. Prema provided a variety fare with several gems  from the Dikshitar's treasure chest.Exotic kritisFrom the opening `Vinayaka Vigna Nasaka' in Vegavahini to the concluding `Ganga Mampahi' in Chenchurutti,  she packed her programme with  the exotic kritis of Dikshitar apart from a few popular ones. `Parameswara Jagadeeswara' in Nattai with its well-knit chittaswaram was followed by `Brahadambigayai Namaste' in Vasantha that came with a neat niraval and swara passage at `Brahadeesa Mohita.' A breezy alapana of Mohanam preceded `Pahimam Parvathi.' `Sringara Rasamanjarim' in Rasamanjari, `Chidambara Natarajam' in Kedaram and `Santatam Govindarajam' (Sankarabahranam) in western note made for the interesting mixture.The raga of the evening was Kalyani and `Sivakameswarim Chintaye' stood out for its niraval and kalpanaswara, especially at `Sivakameswara Manapriya Hari' in the anupallavi. The kalpanaswara segments, instead of being connected by the usual strands,  landed on the ascending and descending notes of Kalyani raga aarohanam and avarohanam. The kuraippu swaras were perfectly assembled   converging immaculately on the finale. It was again Padma Shankar who followed the vocalist on the violin.  Her versatility fully complemented Prema in the raga alapana, niraval and the swara segments. Melakkaveri Balaji on the mridangam and N.Guruprasad on the ghatam captured the attention of the audience with their  subdued but crisp percussion layers in their extended thani avartanam.Bottom Template Starts
