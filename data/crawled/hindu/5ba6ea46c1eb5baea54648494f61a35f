VWith a view to mark not only the year ending schedule but also its farewell  with something special, Visakha Music and Dance Academy featured a thematic composition of orchestral music in its auditorium Kalabharathi .It was intended to be a symphony effort musically expounding the individual attributes of the five elements (Panchabhootas-akasa/space,vayu/air,teja/fire,apas/water andprudhvi/earth), their cumulative action yielding positive results that help creativity progress unhindered.It was as well intended to correlate the phenomenon with some of the nerve plexus such as theVisuddha, Anahatha, ManipuraandSwaadhishtana chakrasas they find mention in books on Indianyoga. The music was composed by the local veena virtuoso R. Madhuri Devi, holder of M.Phil degree in music of the Delhi University.She had six veenas played by noted artistes  T. Padmini, A. Pushpa, V. Anjani, V. Subbalakshmi and A. Ashok with herself in the lead, Mohammed Parviz ( guitar), Ch. Srinivas ( keyboard), M. Sridhar (mridangam), A. Rambabu (tabla, ghatam) and vocal rendering of somejathisby R. Tejeswi, M.S. Prakash (eletronic pads) and morsing by G. Venkatesh besides vocalists, N. Kiran Kumar, T. Radha and Indrakanti D. Priyadarsini to renderOmand select hymns from theMantrapushpa. Madhuri sought to picturise the positive as well as the negative facets of each element with the help ofSuddhaandPrathimadhyama ragas.The appropriation of theragaandlayapatterns seemed to be neither logical nor scientific. Devoid of any consonant and otherwise chords, counters and so forth, the composition did not fulfil the norms of the modern concept of symphony music. Nonetheless, isolated from the theme ofPanchabhutas, so on and so forth, the music composing that too very innovatively in the classical idiom deserves appreciation.A.R.SBottom Template Starts
