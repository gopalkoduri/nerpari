VVijay Siva's erudite vocal recital featured by The P.R. Ramakrishnan Endowment Trust at the Corporation Kalaiarangam brought out the burnished shimmer of the ragas and numbers handled by the top-notch artist. The range of his musical expression imbued with a softly radiant glow was couched in melody and chaste diction.The composition, &#8216;Maha Ganapathi' in Thodi, a rare beginning for a kutcheri, was demonstrative of patanthara suddham. After the rendition of &#8216;Sadananda Thandavam' (Bahudari) with niraval and swaras, his alapana of Pantuvarali for the kriti &#8216;Aparamabhakti' and Bhairavi for the song, &#8216;Rakshe Bettare' were suffused with imaginative phrasings and the more he delved into them, the more were the varieties of nuggets, which he brought out nonchalantly.The compositions themselves were rendered in a tone of intense devotion and compassion. The raga delineation of Mohanam kriti, &#8216;Kapali' strung together strands of assertive prayogas made vibrant by suitable swara combinations, and a generous use of akaaraa invested it with a haunting quality for the rasikas. The presentation of &#8216;Mayamma' in Aahiri was a lilting interpretation. Sriramkumar's violin accompaniment was superior all the way and his fluent versions of ragas and swara sallies lingered on their grace and elegance. Mali's (mridangam) and Athreya's (ganjira) heightened the dignity of the concert with their measured and rhythmic beats.Winsome packageSinging to a packed audience at the Corporation Kalaiarangam, Nithyasree Mahadevan, to the accompaniment of Krishnaswami (violin), Sivakumar (mridangam) and Suresh (ghatam), displayed her mastery over her vocal range and fluency of expression on the second day of the music concert featured by the Endowment Trust. Her winsome start of &#8216;Gananayaka Varanamuka' varnam in Sunadhavinodhini with chittaswarams, struck an instant rapport with the listeners. &#8216;Paramathmudu' (Bagheswari ) and &#8216;Manavyala' (Nalinakanti) reflected the singer's enthusiasm and zealous approach in kriti renditions.The presentation of the kriti, &#8216;Ninnuvina' was enjoyable. &#8216;Mayarohanesam' (Karnataka Devagandhari) and &#8216;Karunai Purindhu Rakshiamma' (Nattakurinji) brimmed with esoteric appeal.Her alapana of Kalyani for &#8216;Etavunara' was marked by clear and telling prayogas softened by jarus indicating a perceptive mind.Krishnaswami (violin) provided melodic modulation and perpetual lyrical softness in bowing.Sivakumar (mridangam) and Suresh's (ghatam) well-balanced thani with multiple segments of soft and subtle rhythmic layers in the laya wing added zest to the kutcheri.Gripping swara passagesViolinist-turned vocalist, Amirtha Murali, who had done her homework, displayed her manodharma and vidwat on the concluding day of the fest.Beginning her concert with the Sri raga varnam, &#8216;Saami Ninne,'Amirtha took up &#8216;Sankaradhi' in Manohari and her sarvalaghu swaras in the charanam were gripping. Her tonal niceties in gamaka were evident in the alapana of Harikhambodi for the kriti, &#8216;Entha Neethana' though there was some vocal discomfort in the upper reaches.After a brief sketch of Husseini for the song, &#8216;Raghuveera Ranadheera' her raga vinyasam of Purvikalyani for Syama Sastri's &#8216;Ninnuvina' showed her penchant for sangatis and subtle prayogas.In her alapana of Thodi as the main piece of the kutcheri for the kriti, &#8216;Karthikeya Kangeya,' its vivid and imaginative structure showed her adherence to sampradaya.Amirtha concluded her concert with peppy thukkadas.Ananthapadmanabha's (violin) responses to the solo versions of ragas and swaras were commendable. Sivakumar's (mridangam) play of subtle patterns was lively in the percussion wing.
