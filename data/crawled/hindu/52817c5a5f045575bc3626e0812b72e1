VCome Sunday and grounds in Chennai normally host some cricket match or the other during the day. Halls in Chennai feature Carnatic concerts in the evenings.Amateur cricketers play with zest and seriousness, as if they are competing  at the State or national level.  The vidwans too perform with the same energy, crowd or no crowd.These thoughts came to mind while watching the last few overs of a cricket match at the P.S. High School ground before walking into the Dakshinamurthy Auditorium adjacent to it.Nadopasana presented G.R.S. Murthy on the veena that Sunday evening. The smooth sound of the veena did help overcome the radiation from the parched ground. The heat and the sight of an empty hall did not deter Murthy.&#8216;Ramaa Neepai&#8217; (Kedaram-Adi-Tyagaraja) has a natural lilt to it and Murthy&#8217;s approach did full justice to the kriti.A neat sketch of Purvikalyani replete with jantai and gamaka oriented phrases, ended with &#8216;Anandanadamaduvar Thillai&#8217; (Rupakam-Nilakanta Sivan). It was proof enough for this man&#8217;s prowess on the instrument.&#8216;Kalavati&#8217; (Kalavati-Adi-Dikshitar) passed muster. As rasikas began filling the hall, Murthy took up Mukhari, a raga that is slowly fading into oblivion.It was full of rakthi phrases and right concoction of classicism and jana ranjakam.A perfect ten for &#8216;Ema Ninne&#8217; (Adi-Subbaraya Sastry). Murthy cleverly avoided the swaras to allow the rasikas soak in the kriti&#8217;s beauty.Mannarkoil J. Balaji (mridangam) embellished it further with his deft touches. B.S. Purushothaman (ganjira) did not lag behind, what with his feathery landings befitting a veena recital.&#8216;Nee Chittamu&#8217; (Vijayavasantham-Adi-Tyagaraja) came in as an end-change bowler.Balaji was in his elements. Murthy&#8217;s treatment of Sankarabharanam, the evening&#8217;s main raga, deserves special mention.Firmly rooted in tradition, this disciple of G.N. Dandapani Iyer strived to sketch the raga&#8217;s vintage beauty, sans gimmicks.Tanam and veena are synonymous but it was disappointing that he chose to skip it. &#8216;Akshaya Linga Vibho&#8217; (Misra Chapu-Dikshitar) was presented in all its grandeur.Balaji and Purushothaman combined well to present a tani.
