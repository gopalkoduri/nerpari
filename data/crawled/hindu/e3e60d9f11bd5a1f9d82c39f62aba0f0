VGuru KeerthanaaniSri Sadasivendra StavahSwathi's Sanskriti seriesMusic by: V.SubrahmaniamPrice: Rs. 150One of the earlier pontiffs of the Dakshinamaya Sringeri Mutt, Sri Sacchidananda Sivabhinava Nrisimha Bharathi has composed a set of 45 slokas extolling the greatness of the avadhuta Sri Sadasiva Brahmendral.Composed by musician V. Subrahmaniam, the deep philosophical content of the lyrics are soothing to listen to.The instrumentalists who are featured in this album are Jayalakshmi Sekhar (veena), Mala Chandrasekhar (flute), R. K. Sriram Kumar (violin) and J. Vaidyanathan (mridangam). Slokas on the presiding deity of Sringeri, Goddess Saradambal, and on the pontiffs of the Mutt serve as curtain raisers.Vocalised by Subrahmaniam, these hymns are offered in ragas such as Bhairavi, Bilahari, Saveri and Kalyani.The central piece of the album &#8216;Sadasivendra Stavah' is preceded by a vibrant thanam on the veena in Nattai.Clear lyricsThe full-throated singing and clarity of the lyrics mark the vocal display of Meenakshi Ganesh, Bhavana Iyer and Maalavika Sundar. They however seem to be more comfortable in the upper registers, as can be heard in the passage tuned in raga Desh.The tunesmith has chosen popular ragas such as Nattai, Hamsadhwani, Abhogi, Nattakurinji, Shanmukhapriya, Kannada, Brindavanasaranga, Khamas, Kuntalavarali, Desh, Kaanada, Behag, Kapi, Hamsanandi, Bagesri, Sindhubhairavi and Suratti.Raga bhavas of the chosen melodies come out well and stand testimony to the musical maturity of Subrahmaniam. Pleasing raga portrayals by the instrumentalists add charm to the verses.Vaidyanathan maintains a brisk khanda nadai throughout. The disc ends with Brahmendral's &#8216;Pibare Rama Rasam' (Yamunakalyani), set to music by Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. Vaidyanathan's playing for this piece is a sheer delight.The booklet accompanying the compact disc provides meanings of the slokas in English, which helps one to enjoy the music better.
