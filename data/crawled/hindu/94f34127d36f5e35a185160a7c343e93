VGenerally, Carnatic vocalists prefer to take up weighty and well-known melodies for Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi, probably because they feel lighter and less familiar ragas may not give them adequate scope for developing the concept fully and properly. But highly accomplished solo instrumentalists don't feel such constraints. Among the leading musicians who seem to specialise in adopting a variety of unusual and attractive ragas for RTPs in their performances together, are violinists Lalgudi Krishnan and his sister Vijayalakshmi.They've been offering an annual treat to the regular and earnest audience at Hamsadhwani in the form of a Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi in some infrequently heard and delicate raga -- such as Saraswati (in 2007), Bhavani (2008), and Hamsanandhi (2009). So one was wondering what it was going to be this year; and the eloquent answer was Rasikapriya -- which can be translated, if one is permitted some liberty, as &#8216;One for the rasikas!' And it turned out to be a beautiful garland of colourful flowers, with a string of other lovely tunes also added in the improvised swara sequences.Dynamic teamWith such pleasant memories of past events surfacing in the mind, one couldn't help recalling that for the consistent excellence achieved by them at this venue in recent years, Lalgudi Krishnan and Vijayalakshmi had owed much to the accompanying percussionists, including mridangam maestros Umayalpuram Sivaraman and T.V. Gopalakrishnan, and the sensitive ghatam player V. Suresh (who is one of TVG's distinguished disciples). And in the concert under review, Srimushnam Raja Rao and S.V. Ramani, playing the mridangam and ghatam respectively, gave a dynamic performance which was an equally effective source of inspiration for the violinists.Another strong impression obtained by many listeners on the occasion was that Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi, whose violin sounded particularly energetic and graceful, gave one of the best performances of her career, with a superb alapana of raga Charukesi, as well as brilliant exchanges with her brother at every stage of the recital.The concert began and ended, as usual, with a varnam and a tillana composed by the violinists' father and guru, Lalgudi Jayaraman, in the ragas Neelambari and Mishra-Shivranjani respectively. The songs included Subbaraya Sastri's composition &#8216;Jananee Ninuvina' (Ritigowlai) and Tyagaraja's &#8216;Aadamodi Galadaa' (Charukesi), &#8216;Naada Loludai' (Kalyanavasantam) and &#8216;Mohana Raama' (Mohanam).
