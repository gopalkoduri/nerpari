VNadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha had arranged Nadakishorothsava-2009 in Mysore for five days, with 20 concerts of young talented artistes. The platform also served as a means to recognise and select a suitable artiste for the Nadakishora award.H.N. Smitha sang accompanied by Sushruth (violin) and A. Radhesh (mridanga). The artiste exhibited control over articulations of varied nature and speed. Her only shortcoming was a gentleness in displaying her competence.As this factor percolated into all the presentations, the alapanas, though instantly delineated the morphological features of the ragas, belittled their essence and melody. &#8220;Intamodi seyaga&#8221; (Varna-Saranga-Thiruvottiyur Thyagayya) preceded &#8220;Sarasiruhasana priye&#8221; (Naata-Puliyur Doreswamy Iyer), and in both, undue speed masked the clarity of the lyrics. She was fluent in elaborating the ragas and quick in framing the swaraprastara, but they remained short of appreciable appeal because of the lack of necessary pauses and intonations.&#8220;Kamakshi&#8221; (Varali-Shyamashastri) featuring an elaborate alapana, neraval at &#8220;Tamasamela&#8221; and elaborate swaraprastara would have been more pleasing and absorbing had the artiste considered the tone of the lyrics, which addressed the Goddess with utmost affection and humbleness.Other inclusions were &#8220;Shankari nive&#8221; (Begade-Subbarayashastri) &#8220;Kamalapthakula&#8221; (Brindavani-Thyagaraja) and others.***Meghana Murthy&#8217;s concert (H.N. Smitha on violin and Shashishankar on mridanga), trod a path very much similar to the above concert. Her voice spans over the required sthayis with ease without losing the timbre, but the volume disproportionately increases with the rise in the pitch.Varna in Durbar, &#8220;Chalamela&#8221; (Tiruvottiyur Thyagayya /Veena Kuppayya) gave an impetus to the concert, followed by Shyamashastri&#8217;s &#8220;Brovavamma&#8221; (Nilambari). A pleasing tempo with liberally-employed lilting jaarugamakas rendered the latter one pleasing. In general, one could feel a great deal of attention paid to complicated articulations of varied combinations and permutations comprising cursively-executed akaaras without sufficient pauses. In Begade (Nadopasana-Thyagaraja), she was clearer in expressing the shades of the raga than the emotive aspects of it.An elaborate neraval at &#8220;Thantrilaya&#8221; was fluent and inspiring. Swarakalpana sections conformed to the intricate patterns, which spoke of committed practice. However, the clarity in lyrics suffered because of slurred accentuations.The young artiste could have planned the concert more meticulously to include either a Devaranama or a Thillana for an ideal conclusion.***Shubha Santosh played the veena, reaching professional heights. A composed approach automatically kept her comfortable while interpreting the ragas.Take for example Thodi (&#8220;Shrikrishnam bhaja&#8221;- Dikshithar), which she elaborated incorporating different ragas (efforts at shrutibheda to elicit Kalyani did not materialise satisfactorily). Graces with special effects beautified all the passages, and imaginative developments enlivened her extempore. Neraval at &#8220;Shankhachakradhara&#8221; favoured the import of the lyrics, and swarakalpana too did sufficient justice to the composition.&#8220;Meevalla gunadhosha&#8221; (Kaapi-Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Krishna ni begane&#8221; (Yamuna Kalyani) were among other highlights. Shashishankar (mridanga) and Manjunath (ghata) accompanied her, harmonising with the style of the artiste and the resonance of the finely-tuned veena.
