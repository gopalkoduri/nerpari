VThe year-long Diamond Jubilee celebrations of the Malleswaram Music Sabha will come to a close on February 24 at the Chowdiah Memorial Hall. Felicitations, concerts, ensembles and exhibitions will mark the big day of the 60-year old Sabha that has ch\u000aalked its path with eagerness to propagate &amp; broaden the horizons of music.The Sabha is all set to felicitate senior musicians such as R.K. Srikantan, Seethalakshmi Venkateshan and Rajamma Keshava Murthy and the valedictory occasion would also see young talent as Ananya Prathibha Puraskar awardees take to the stage.The grand ensemble of the evening however, &#8220;Ninaada Vaadya Vaibhava&#8221; with a 20-instrument rhapsody (directed by B.K. Chandramouli) would splash melodies even as variety of percussion instruments and rare inclusions such as the chande, pakhawaj and dolu is gearing to collectively thump for an aural treat in the string-and-percussion assemblage.&#8220;The evening will see a singularly different photo exhibition of musicians too that have lit the stages of the sabha since six decades,&#8221; says M.R. Doraiswamy Iyengar, President, Malleswaram Sangeeta Sabha.Recalling the long journey Mr. Iyengar says: &#8220;The Sabha has seen everything&#8230;toil, hard work, economic crunch which threatened its survival, a hither-thither run for concert halls and of course some extraordinary melody moments by  stalwarts, and the reams of dedicated study material from seminars and lecture-demonstrations helped thousands of enthusiastic learners and rasikas across Bangalore.&#8221;The Sabha now enjoys a 1000-member strong list with star musicians and musicologists making their presence  through the year. The reward is doubled as the Sabha will see the construction of its own building flagging off soon in Malleswaram for its activities.It was the passion and burning zeal of a few young music enthusiasts in Malleswaram that set the ball rolling. It started by way of a few modest concerts in the Forties.Within months, violin vidwan T. Chowdiah had stepped in to offer his good offices and make it &#8216;a running sabha&#8217; naming it the Malleswaram Sangeeta Sabha. With M.L. Srinivasa Sastry as the founder president, the Sabha also had musicologists as T.B. Narasimhachar (Saragrahi), B.V.K.Sastry and E.N. Sitaraman in its committee earlier.&#8220;We haven&#8217;t looked back since then as far as bringing musicians and dance artistes from all over to Bangalore. We are grateful to Parveen Sultana and M.S. Subbulakshmi for their philanthropic endeavours,&#8221; says a release from the Sabha.&#8220;Over the years we brought in a lot of interesting events as the Veena Utsav where in different styles of veena play was celebrated. The Eka Vaggeyakara concert series was a raga-composer-kriti acclimatisation for the young, while the Haridasa Sammelana in 2004-05 exposed the works of Haridasas through the year,&#8221; explains Mr. Iyengar.The Sabha was one of the oldest in instituting the talent hunt &#8216;Tiger Varadachariar Memorial Music Competition&#8217;. Hundreds of students in the city take part.  &#8220;Our monthly and yearly events are serpentine with thematic and commemorative musical saints&#8217; day and festival youth performances that is announced in our magazine &#8216;Nadopasana&#8217;,&#8221; says Iyengar. &#8220;The Sabha&#8217;s work has been appreciated by visiting artistes of repute as De. Rosette Ranshaw, Indirani Rehman, Kamaladevi Chattopadyaya and the German Quartet.&#8221;As the robust 60-year journey gains momentum in the Diamond celebrations, the Sabha is instituting a scholarship programme for  poor students interested in learning music.&#8220;We will release funds directly to the guru,&#8221; says Iyengar.
