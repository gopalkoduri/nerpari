VIn the rendering of &#8216;Kanta Joodumi&#8217; (Tyagaraja)  one witnessed a continuous interplay of bhava and technique, the niraval and meaningful swaras at &#8216;Ala Naadu Sowmithri,&#8217; and  the splitting of sahitya to contain and convey its full meaning.Her other songs &#8212; &#8216;Varanamukhava&#8217; (Hamsadhwani, Koteeswara Iyer), &#8216;Narasimha Maamava&#8217; (Arabhi, SwatiTirunal), &#8216;Meru Samaana&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla, Tyagaraja), &#8216;Maa Ramanan&#8217; (Hindolam, Sivan), &#8216;Sri Maathru Bhootham&#8217; (Kannada, Dikshitar), &#8216;Sarasamukhi&#8217; (Gowdamalhar, Harikesanallur), &#8216;Rama Namame Thudhi&#8217; (Desh, Sankara Iyer) and a tillana  (Revathi) &#8212; were outputs that were registered well and served to vindicate the laudable scholarly distinctions she has achieved.Sri Ragam (&#8216;Nama Kusuma&#8217;- Tyagaraja) was the main item, sung with a focus to proclaim its Carnatic colour. An afterthought, as one listened to her, is  a suggestion &#8212; a slight lowering of her sruti (pitch).Ramakrishnan (violin) seemed to derive inspiration from the main artiste and showed  depth, and rendered  winsome prayogas during raga alapanas and swara exchanges. Nellai Balaji (mridangam) gave a thani &#8212; short, yet full of substance.
