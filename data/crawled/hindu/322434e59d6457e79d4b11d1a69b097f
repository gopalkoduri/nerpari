VThe Performing Arts Promotion Trust presented a classical music concert in memory of the late Ustad Ali Akbar Khan at the  India bHabitat Centre recently, featuring Sarathi Chatterjee in a vocal and Shubhendra Rao in a sitar recital.Invoking the long awaited rain, Sarathi opened his recital with raga Megh. The bada khayal &#8220;Baadal garjat aaye&#8221; was set to the slow tempo (vilambit) Ek tala where the gradual elaboration of the monsoon raga revealed its different facets. The complex variety of taans in sargam and aakar also adorned the drut Ek tala bandish, &#8220;Kajra kaare, laage ati pyaare&#8221; and the Teen tala bandish &#8220;Gagan garje damkat daamini&#8221;, bringing out the lyrical content of the compositions. Trained initially by his father Pandit Arun Chatterjee of the Kirana gharana, Sarathi is further groomed under the tutelage of Pandit Rajan and Sajan Mishra. Hence he has imbibed the characteristic features of the Benaras gharana from them and the delicate nuances of thumri from his father.He followed up with a beautiful  composition in Ramdasi Malhar, &#8220;Ghana aye  Ghanshyam na aaye&#8221;, and a tarana set to drut Ek tala. With due consideration for the next artiste, Sarathi wanted to end his recital at this point but on insistence by the appreciative audience, he also sang a melodious bhajan, &#8220;Mo sam kaun kutil khal kaami&#8221; composed by Arun Chatterjee in raga Kafi. The melodic appeal of the ragas and the  thumri style bhajan were enhanced by the involved harmonium accompaniment of Paromita Mukherjee that echoed the vocalist&#8217;s every nuance. Prasoon Chatterjee gave commendable support on the tabla,   though time constraints did not permit his prowess to be fully displayed.Shubhendra Rao, a gifted disciple of Pandit Ravi Shankar, played a detailed alap-jod-jhala in raga Hem Bihag, a special raga of the Maihar gharana, created by Baba Alauddin Khan. Before offering this as a personal tribute to the late Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, he  recalled a very special occasion his father, also a disciple of Ravi Shankar, had told him about: when Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, his sister Annapoorna Devi and Ravi Shankar once played this raga together, on the sarod, surbahar and sitar respectively, for three hours at a stretch during one of their practice sessions at Maihar. Shubhendra then played three compositions in slow, medium and fast tempo in Tilak-Shyam, a raga created by his illustrious guru, concluding it with a jet speed jhala. Durjay Bhaumik gave him brilliant percussion support on the tabla.  The drab background of the stage and the lacklustre announcements left much to be desired.
