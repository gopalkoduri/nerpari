VThe centuries-old tradition of the Mir community is on the verge of  extinction because of economic hardships and the drastic changes in the socio-economic structure, which have  left them with no audience. There are hardly a few families that are still practicing this art. &#8216;Manana&#8217;, who has been involved in a research and documentation initiative on the music of Mir singers and helps them with scholarships, concerts and recordings, presented an evening of Sufi music by Mir Mukhtiyaar Ali and his troupe at the Habitat Centre recently.Mir Mukhtiyaar Ali opened the mesmerising musical evening with a few couplets of Sultan Bahu followed by &#8220;Jive mera murshad Bahu&#8230;&#8221; in his typical style that had an uncanny resemblance with the classical Patiala gayaki. He has such a superb command over his voice that it belies the fact  that he never had any training in classical music. Whatever he has learnt, he says, is only by listening to his elders (&#8220;Buzurgon ko sun kar seekha hai&#8221;).The Sindhi Kaafi &#8220;Kaladi jungle bich&#8230;&#8221; of Khwaja Ghulam, the kalam of Ghulam Farid &#8220;Aisa Ranjha albela&#8230;&#8221; in the melodious raga Patdeep or Shah Hussain&#8217;s &#8220;Man atkilaa&#8230;&#8221; soaked in the serenity of raga Darbari &#8212; whatever he sang,  every composition was in a different raga with a matching rhythmic theka. But the most moving quality of his  music was his total involvement with the poetry and its emotional content depicting the yearning for communion with the Divine.Ghulam Hussain ably accompanied him on the tabla, Faqruddin on the harmonium, while Abdul Jabbar and Allah Rakha gave him vocal support. It was heartening to see that despite declining patronage, Mirs under the leadership of Mukhtiyaar Ali and others are making an effort to revive their dying musical tradition. Mir-e-Alams like Mukhtiyaar Ali and Vasu Khan have taken the initiative to train talented children in their villages. Young Allah Rakha is one such devoted disciple of Mir Mukhtiyaar Ali, who gave an ample account of his talent and training.MANJARI SINHA* * *
