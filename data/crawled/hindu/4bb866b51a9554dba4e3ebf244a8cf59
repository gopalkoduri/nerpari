VAlthough inclement weather kept a large chunk of the regular audience away, those who braved the rain to be present at the concert were well rewarded for their efforts, as the musical expression of this accomplished disciple of H.S. Mahalakshmi and P.S.Narayanaswami displayed a natural flow, free from clich&#233;s and affectation, that drew the listener into the field of the artist&#8217;s vision with gentle insistence. An experience that had you rooting for the vocalist as a participant rather than as a spectator.Warming up with an ugabhoga that preceded &#8216;Sharanu Siddhi Vinayaka&#8217; (Saurashtram), the vocalist projected Khamas with poise and composure in a soothing jaru and gamaka-embellished &#8216;Krishnaya Vasudevaya&#8217; followed by a brisk dasarnama &#8216;Mooruthiyane Nilliso.&#8217; The kalpanaswaras with their easy lilt were proof of the vocalist&#8217;s penchant for crafting appealing patterns in sarvalaghu mode.Using time management to good effect in this two-hour programme, the artiste embarked on an exposition of the prathimadhyama vivadhi raga Jyothiswaroopini, the 68th melam certainly an unusual choice and one complemented by a praiseworthy interpretation. The apt mix of janta swara permutations and emphatic gamakas tempered with timely glimpses of the shatsruthi rishabha and antara gandhara made for an unhurried exploration that established the ragas identity with calm deliberation, taking it beyond a scale-based exposition.&#8216;Ninna Nambide&#8217; sung with passion and involvement took the recital to a melodic high, with strong supportive input and frequently expressed appreciation from the violinist, M.A.Krishnaswami and Manoj Siva&#8217;s powerful percussive strokes adding momentum.&#8216;Kelano Hari&#8217; (Suruti) ushered in a contrast in mood and pace.It was an expressive and grammatically sound Ranjani alapana that surfaced through madhyamakala akara passages. Sancharas radiating from an extended halt at the tara stahyi shadja and the rishabha rang true with conviction.The composition was Hari Neene Gathi. Fresh perspectives added sheen to Sankarabharanam in the dhaivata-nishadha suite, the alapana fortified by weighty prayogas and meaningful content that steered clear of formula fare.Full-throated karvais and intricately braided passages at the tara sthayi gandhara afforded an insight into the true potential of the artistes voice.The niraval and swaras at &#8216;Suramunigalu&#8230;&#8217;  (Pogadirelo Ranga) proceeded with verve.Vasudha Keshav&#8217;s interpretations were characterised by an innate honesty that was refreshing.If the artiste could focus on two aspects - greater clarity in sahitya enunciation and the opening up of the voice to achieve a non-constricted tone in the upper register, they would add considerably to the appeal of her music.M.A.Krishnaswami&#8217;s immensely supportive role on the violin gave a fillip to the vocalist&#8217;s impulses and his Sankarabharanam alapana glowed bright with a cascade of sancharas from the tara sthayi.Manoj Siva (mridangam) and Anirudh Athreya (ganjira) embellished compositions and kalpanaswara with the right touches of exuberance and subtlety.
