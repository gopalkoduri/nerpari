VPost-thani, after &#8216;Annapoorne&#8217; (Sama, Muthuswami Dikshitar) an RTP in Hindolam surfaced. Of the three ragas presented, it was in Hindolam that execution best coalesced with intention. Airy drifts rose in ascending spirals to attain an eagle&#8217;s-eyrie perch on the tara shayi gandhara from which swift sancharas swooped to snatch easy prey. The tanam with percussive accompaniment built atmosphere. The pallavi in 2-kalai khanda triputa tala, that morphed into1-kalai format during melkala swaras and then into rupaka tala, scored a bull&#8217;s-eye. Ragamalika festoons followed. The violinist, Raghavendra Rao, faithfully echoed the vocalist&#8217;s predilections. Also, he presented a Hindolam in which cohesiveness melded with melody.The tani with simple permutations was a tidy exchange between Neyveli Skandasubramaniam (mridangam) and R. Raman (morsing) who kept it short and sweet to allow sufficient time for the pallavi.
