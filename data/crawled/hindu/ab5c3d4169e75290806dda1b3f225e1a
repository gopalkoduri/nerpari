VAn artiste&#8217;s  musical instinct manifests itself in a sensitive exposition of kirtanas in a recital. In such a kutcheri, creativity and power of expression  go hand in hand and if the  voice of the artiste is appealing, the rasikas experience th\u000ae sukhanubhava of the music presented.Mysore Vasudha Keshav, while displaying her musical wares at the monthly concert under the auspices of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, provided this sukhanubhava to the rasikas. Visranthi characterised her concert, which was free of cliches and affectation.Warming up with &#8216;Vanajakshanee&#8217; (Vedantagamana), she rendered &#8216;Thappulannu&#8217; in Bowli. &#8216;Anupamagunambudi&#8217; (Atana) prefaced by a brief alapana, which was presented with swaras, showcased her penchant for appealing patterns in the sarvalaghu style.In the raga alapanas of Manirangu for the kriti, &#8216;Paradevate&#8217; and Subhapantuvarali for &#8216;Ennaloorake&#8217;, she mapped the contours with an aesthetic array of sancharas.&#8216;Devadevam bhaje&#8217; in Dhanyasi was presented with  involvement. Her exposition of the prathimadhyama vivadhi raga, Jothiswaroopini, for the pallavi, &#8216;Roopini jagatroopini jothiswaroopini sadha twamashrayeham&#8217; with full-throated karvais and felicitous flavour was absorbing.Madhav&#8217;s sensitive violin accompaniment gave a fillip to the vocalist&#8217;s impulses and his raga sancharas and impressive swara repartees were enjoyable. Anantakrishana Sarma (mridangam) and Suresh (ghatam) provided an interesting tani.
