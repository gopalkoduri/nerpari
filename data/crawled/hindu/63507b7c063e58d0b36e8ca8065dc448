VBanyan Tree Events, in their series of the All India Sufi and mystic music festival, conducted its sixth annual event in Hyderabad at Ravindra Bharathi to a packed audience. Brainchild of Mahesh Babu, Director of Banyan Tree Events, Ruhaniyat has become a platform for unknown artistes from all over the country and beyond.The Ruhaniyat concept unique to Banyan tree had Sufi Kalam and mystic songs from Rajasthan, Baul singers from Bengal, Shabads and Sufi singers from Punjab, Sufiana Kalam songs from Kashmir and Qawwals from Muradabad.The most impressive performers of this season were the Shabad performers from Punjab and the Sufiana group from Kashmir.The programme began with Beejal Khan and his troupe from Rajasthan. Jameel Khan sang two compositions. One of the compositions, a romantic mystic poems was by Baba Bhuleshah. This truly emotional story was well sung by the artiste. It is a fascinating sight to see the folk musicians of Rajasthan with their musical instruments, who besides dressing themselves in colourful attire, also decorate and embellish their instruments with beautiful trappings and ornamental coverings.The artiste using the Khartal was very good and was applauded the most for his creative use of the instrument.
