VTrained under stalwarts of Carnatic music such as D.K. Jayaraman, T.R. Subrahmanian, P.S. Narayanaswami, Balamuralikrishna, and T.N. Krishnan, S. Suresh Kumar has imbibed the traits of these masters of various banis. In a concert in Palakkad, Suresh enthralled rasikas with his style that integrated these banis.A faculty member of Music College, Pondicherry, Suresh's concert was noted for his stage presence, repertoire, meticulous planning, and judicious selection of ragas, kritis, and talas. Suresh's flair for creativity was evident in his ragalapana and skilful weaving of rhythmic patterns of kalpanaswaras.Instrumental supportExcellent accompaniment by Subbaraman (violin), and Mahesh Kumar (mridangam) added lustre to the concert.Suresh began the concert with a majestic Adi tala varnam in Kederagowla &#8211; &#8216;Sami dayajuda.' Next, he conveyed the spiritual beauty of Papanasam Sivan's &#8216;Gajavadana karunasadana' in Sreeranjani (Adi tala).A choukkakala Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Renukadevi' in Kannadabangala (Khandh chappu tala) was adorned with crisp kalpanaswara segments.The singer rendered &#8216;Anandanatamatuvar,' a composition of Papanasam Sivan in Poorvikalyani (Roopaka tala), and a sublime Charukesi for Swati's kriti &#8216;Kripaya palaya' (Misra chappu tala). A fast-paced &#8216;Natimatta' in Devakriya paved the way to the highlight of the evening a memorable ragam-thanam-pallavi.A dexterous depiction of Kalyani showcased his insight into the rakthi of the raga. Subbaraman's mellifluous essay of the raga was marked by aesthetic sancharas. Tanam was woven into attractive phrases and the pallavi was a well-articulated &#8216;Varadayaka Raghunayaka&#8230;.' That was set to a complex a Khandhajathi thriputa thala in khandhanata. It was followed by ragamalika swara strings in Sindhubhairavi, Sahana, Hamsanandi, and Mohanam.The tani was innovative.The artiste also rendered &#8216;Govardhanagiridhari'(Darbarikanada) and &#8216;Karpakame'(Madhyamavathy). He concluded with a lilting Thiruppukazh &#8216;Mathiyal uthamanaki' in Surutti.The concert was organised by Swathi Sangeetha Sabha, Palakkad.
