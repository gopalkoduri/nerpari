VJ.R. SHRIDHARANThe packed auditorium at Thummalapallivari Kshetrayya Kalakshetram,  Vijayawada last Sunday highlighted the fact that music lovers still patronise the songs of musical genius late Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao.  On the occasion  of the 33rd death anniversary of the Telugu playback doyen,  hundreds of music lovers arrived not just to pay tribute to the legendary singer, but also to sway to the rendition of his songs by V. Ramakrishna and Satyavani. The organisers, which included Anjaneya Vilas owner Brahmam and Professional Artistes' Association  provided a platform to local amateur singers to exhibit their singing prowess. Over 200 singers from all  groups  took the audience to a new high with their melodious renditions through the day. Ramakrishna was in his element as he sang many runaway hitsGhana Ghana Sundara(Bhakta Tukaram) andMadana Manohara Sundara Naari(Anarkali). Giving him able support  was the Guntur-based singer Satyavani, who matched Ramakrishna song for song in rendering some memorable duets. She also sang a couple of sizzling solo numbers of P. Susheela, much to the delight of the audience. Some of the other numbers that Ramakrishna  rendered wereYedo Yedo Annadhi(Muthyala Muggu) and the title song of the filmSarada. Duets, such as the rhythmicMama Mama Mama,Priyuraala SiggelaneandHaayi Haayigaaadded pep to the programme.The organisers bestowed the Ghantasala memorial award on the famous flautist Santharam, who hails from Kakinada. As a token of appreciation, the singers were given Rs. 200 by the corporates.
