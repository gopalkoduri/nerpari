VA. D. RANGARAJANLegendary vocalist Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna has been appointed the &#8216;Asthana Vidwan&#8217; of Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams for the second time.With this, he becomes the official singer in the Lord&#8217;s court and will have to perform at annual ceremonies and important festivals at the temple for the next two years. After making a resolution to this effect at the TTD Trust Board meeting last week, its chairman B. Karunakar Reddy handed over the nomination charter to the singer at Tirumala.The honorary post of &#8216;Asthana Vidwan&#8217; was held by Balamuralikrishna along with M. S. Subbalakshmi, during 1987-90, after which the post remained unfilled for a variety of reasons. The post has now embraced the classical music maestro after a long gap of 17 years.Balamuralikrishna&#8217;s vocal concert performed later in front of the Venkateswara temple held the audience in thrall, even as the common pilgrims gathered in large numbers to get drenched in the shower of classical music.Bottom Template Starts
