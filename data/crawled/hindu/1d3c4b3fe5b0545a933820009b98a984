VAgain one has to praise  Muthukumar for his  enthusiastic raga exposition traversing the different segments of the melody replete with vivadi swaras for the singular Dikshitar composition &#8216;Santana Manjari Sankari.&#8217;A quick visit of Pantuvarali in the earlier part of his concert with &#8216;Sambo Mahadeva&#8217; adding swaras at &#8216;Gopura Vasa Sundaresa&#8217; was well placed after the opening Kanada varnam in Ata talam and &#8216;Swaminatha Paripalaya&#8217; in Nattai. A sedate &#8216;Janani Ninnuvina&#8217; in Ritigowla of Subbaraya Sastri and a sprightly &#8216;Charanam Vijaya Saraswati&#8217; in Vijayasaraswati of Muthaiah Bhagavatar provided sufficient base  for Muthukumar to settle for Mohanam alapana.The contours and the content of Mohanam were in right measure and &#8216;Nannu Palimpa&#8217; of Tyagaraja went at  a brisk pace. Only  the unintentional blending of akaras with karvai  landed him on  the wrong track at times. The same could be felt in his swaraprastara too. A neatly assembled swara korvai was reduced to a chain of  mundane syllables because of  the speed.A tight leash on these aspects, indeed, can reap  rich dividends for Muthukumar.  B. Ananthakrishnan&#8217;s violin versions of the ragas and swaras were well perceived and executed even though he too tried to ape the vocalist at several points.Trivandrum Balaji&#8217;s beats on the mridangam were overshadowed at times by the intense talam demonstrated by Muthukumar.The conspicuously striking facets of Sankari Krishnan&#8217;s concert were the sheen her voice has acquired in recent times and the depth she provided to her renditions with practice.Sankari treated each raga  with great passion and the result was obvious &#8211; each song glistened with all its merits and melody.Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s enchanting pada varnam &#8216;Thevar Munivar Thozhum&#8217; launched Sankari&#8217;s recital. After the majestic &#8216;Pahimam Sri Rajarajeswari&#8217; in Nattai of Syama Sastri, Ritigowla wafted through gently with several swirls and spins. True, there was absence of karvais here but the composition &#8216;Oararu Mugane&#8217; of Neelakanta Sivan amply compensated for it with poignant touches, with many sangatis of soulful projection.A steady flow of Saveri in its native charm formed a perfect preface to Purandara Dasa&#8217;s &#8216;Barayya Venkataramana.&#8217; The centre place went to Sankarabharanam and Syama Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Saroja Dala Netri.&#8217;Sankari&#8217;s raga expression was   succinct. Once again it was the kriti which was given a lot of attention through proper enunciation, emotion, pauses and sangatis with care and concentration.The swaras at &#8216;Sama Gana Vinodhini&#8217; went on a long journey, &#8216;ga&#8217; figuring in numerous combinations. The closing segment came with the Kanada tillana of Lalgudi and a Thiruppugazh verse. &#8216;Durga Devi&#8217; in Navarasakannada and &#8216;Thenmadurai Vaazh Annaiye&#8217; in Hamsaroopini were fillers in between.If the vocalist and the violinist hail from the same school the advantages are many.Padma Shankar and Sankari, both from the illustrious school of Lalgudi Jayaraman, shared a fine rapport.Padma, who is also a perfectionist, played her part with equal competence and import. A.S.Ranganathan on the percussion was at his best.The concerts, midway between chamber and public, were organised by the Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer Trust at the Sri Parvati Hall.
