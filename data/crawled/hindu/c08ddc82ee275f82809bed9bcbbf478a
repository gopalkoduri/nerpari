VB. RAMADEVIThe Neelaveni Thayarammal Memorial music concert featuring the vocal recital of Ranjani and Gayathri at Nani Palkhiwala Auditorium, Coimbatore, was serene and devout. Except for `Tatvamariya Taramaa' in Ritigowla by Papanasam Sivan, all the kritis were dedicated to Vishnu.The delightfully moving `Balakrishnan Paadamalar' (Dhanyasi), another Sivan kriti, was followed by `Seethaapathi Naa Manasuna' by Tyagaraja in Khamas. During the niraval for the phrase, `Prema Joochi Naa Pai' the beauty of the raga unfolded layer after layer at the same time reinforcing the `bhakti bhava.'The selection comprised  old favourites as well as lesser-known ones.  `Ranga Puravihaara,' popularised by M.S.Subbulakshmi, was presented along with the same sloka, `Sri Ranga Mangala Nidhim' but the treatment was quite different. `Kolam Kaana Vaareer' by Ambujam Krishna (Nattakurinji) describing Sri Rama's pattabhishekam and `Arivaar Yaar Unnai' in Mukhari by Arunachalakkavirayar were immensely enjoyable.The main piece was in Kalyani. While Ranjani formed a good background, Gayathri touched new heights and provided new thrills while depicting the raga. Tyagaraja's `Etavunara Nilugada Neeku' asking Rama straightway as to where He lives, was presented with  dignity and devotion. After the ragamalika virutham with `Naadiya Porul Kai Koodum' and `Nanmaiyum Selvamum Naalum Nalgume,' they sang `Rama Naamame Thuthi Maname'.The Meera bhajan, `Paayoji Maine Raam Ratan Dhan Paayo,' the padam `Kaanthanodu' in Malayalam by Swati Tirunal (Neelambari) and the inevitable  `Kurai Onrum Illai' formed the tail-enders.  The onlykuraiaccording to some rasikas was that they did not sing an abhang.The soft and powerful strokes of Mysore Srikanth (violin) earned great appreciation. His raga delineations were particularly enjoyable.The thani by Neyveli Skanda Subramaniam (mridangam) and N. Guruprasad (ghatam) added to the rich quality of this memorable concert.Bottom Template Starts
