VK.C. ASOK`Living Legends,' a two-day musical programme in the capital city, was a celebration of music.It was a royal treat for music lovers.  `Living Legends,' a two-day musical programme in Thiruvanthapuram, was a celebration of music  that featured   the legendary playback singer Manna Dey and the connoisseur of Carnatic music, M. Balamuralikrishna. Organised by  the Travancore Trust, the concert marked the artistes' birthdays too.Manna Dey took the audience on a nostalgic journey with some of his ever popular, soul-stirring songs. The first song came as a form of  invocation `He malik tere bante hum... .' This evergreen hit from the film, `Do aankem baarah haath' was sung  by Manna Dey and  Kannada singer  Divya .Divya next regaled the audience with golden songs like `Suno sajna... (`Aye din baharke'), `Dil Chees kya he aap mere... '(`Umrao Jaan') and `Vakt ne kiya... ' (`Kagas ke phool').Immortal songsManna Dey took  his seat by his harmonium and running his fingers over the keys, he began singing his all-time hits like `Aye mere zohar-e-jabeen... ' composed by Ravi Bombay, `Yari he Iman mera... ' from the Amitabh Bachchan starrer `Zanjeer', `Ab kaham jaye hum... ,' `Cham cham bajere payaliya... ' and `Surna Saje... ' tuned by Shankar Jaykishan and the ever favourite `Ee rat beegi beegi... ,' Indeevar  -  Kalyanji Anandji duo's `Nadiya chale chale... ,' Anand Bakshi-Laxmikant Pyarelal's `Shaam Tale Jamuna Kinare... ,' and Rajendra Kishan-Madhan Mohan team's `Kaun aya mere man ke dware... '. The song `He mere pyare vatan... ,' was the concluding piece.Be it  light, semi-classical or Qawwali, he belted numbers one after another to the enthusiastic applause of the audience.When Manna Dey crooned `Manasa maine varu... ' it was a trip down memory lane for many, as for Malayalis, the song is synonymous with the singer Manna Dey, whose voice had made this a golden hit some 40 years ago.The troupe had Mahendra Gokhale on the keyboard, Richard Mitra on the lead guitar, Indranath Mukerjee on tabla, Shyam Prasad on the drums and dolak, and Vaman Koli on special effects.The simple orchestration jelled well with the songs.  K.C. Khurana, who has been with Manna Dey as the master of ceremony  for about 45 years, gave the show a touch of laughter with his  humorous narrations.Balamuralikrishna was among the audience on the first day.MesmerisingOn the second day Balamuralikrishna with his powerful voice and self-styledbaniheld the audience spellbound. The ease with which he traversed through notes over three octaves of ragas  amazed music lovers. `Saragunagavumu... ' (padavarnam in Todi), with which he began the concert, is his own composition.Some special krithis by renowned composers were sung that included `Pancha matanga mukha ganapathi... ' in raga Malahari (Muttuswami Dikshithar), `Bageya nayya neemayalentho..' in Chandrajyothi (Thyagaraja), `Namasudhamayi... ' in Suddha dhanyasi (Swati Tirunal), `Viduva Viduva... ' in Suryakaantam (Annamacharya), Jayadeva's Ashtapathi in Raga Kosala and the rare Swati composition, `Nanamakhilesanu... ' forwhich the singer himself has composed a tune in Behag. `Palayasumam saila tanaye..' in Gangeyabhooshani was the main piece.S.R. Vinu on the violin, B. Harikumar on the mridangam, Karthik on the ghatom and Govinda Prasad on the muharshang excelled.  Apart from the main raga, the maestro elaborated ragas such as Malahari, Suddhadhanyasi, Chandrajyothi, and Sooryakantham.He enchanted the audience with his unconventionalaalapana. He also juggled withmanodharma swaras, weaving magic.Singing of tatwam in praise of Lord Siva, to violin strings for sruthi, was another highlight and the concert ended with his own tillana composition in Ahir Bhairavi.The concerts proved that the maestros' unparalleled talent and experience had effectively stopped the clock for these two musicians.Bottom Template Starts
