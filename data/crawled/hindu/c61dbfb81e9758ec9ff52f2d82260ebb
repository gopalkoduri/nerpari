VHARISH BALThe V. N. M. Vasudevan Nambudiripad and Ratnam Thampuran memorial concert, organised by the Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha, Tripunithura, featured K. N. Ranganatha Sharma, a lecturer and a promising musician from Cherthala, who is making waves in Chennai music circles. The concert, had `Meru samana' as the first piece. A Mayamalavagowla raga exposition with fast akaras and crisp swaras to suit it made for a remarkable start.Beautiful variations`Ganarajena rakshithoham' in Arabhi helped sustain the heavy mood of the previous number. The Varali raga alapana for `Kamakshi amba bangaru' of Syama Shastri had some beautiful variations.Trichur Rajendran on the violin played the same phrases andgamakasin different patterns to display the immense possibility of the raga.Another feature of Sharma's singing style is his fantastic voice quality in all three octaves. Mixing bothkalais, he gave a wonderfulswararendition. `Padmanabha palitebha,' a rarely sung kriti of Swati Tirunal, in Malayamarutham set to Roopaka tala, came as a serene interlude. He returned to a weighty number, `Thandava darisanam' by Gopalakrishna Bharati in Reetigowla raga. Rajendran returned to his style of playing `ma ga ri sa' in various patterns. Unni Kerala Varma backed  Parassala Ravi on the mridangom, and the two mridangoms provided  a  sonorous tempo throughout  the  concert.Various other delightful numbers were rendered by the vocalist. A Meera bhajan, `Tum bin mori kaun khabar le' and aslokam`Shiva shakthya yukto' in Hamsanandi raga added to the plaintive mood towards the end  of the concert.Bottom Template Starts
