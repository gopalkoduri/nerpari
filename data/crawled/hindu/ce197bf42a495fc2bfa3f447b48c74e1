VValivalam Venkatraman, seemed to be a performer with high-strung nerves and one observed an apparent simplicity in his singing style.There was a well-conceived plan in his selection of songs that followed the Nattai-Gowlai-Arabhi order that came with  briefly sketched alapanas.&#8216;Pidiyadhan Uruvumai&#8217; in Nattai, a Thirugnana Sambandhar Thevaram verse was rendered in three kalams and was quickly followed by &#8216;Saranagatham Endru Unnai Nambi&#8217; of Gopalakrishna Bharati in Gowlai and for Arabhi it was the song &#8216;Sundara Kunjitha Padha Nilai&#8217;.The Saramathi alapana was of the straight and flat type and Dhandapani Desikar&#8217;s &#8216;Arula Vendum Thaye&#8217; was the obvious choice.Sankarabharanam saw an alapana with clear and winsome phrases and the song was the lovely &#8216;Yaro Endrenni&#8217; of Arunachala Kavi. The finishing course had &#8216;Rama Namame Thudhi&#8217; (Desh-Thanjavur Sankara Iyer) and a Tillana.There was a palpable restlessness in his approach and the urgent need is to cultivate calmness that would help him in adding new shades and a fair degree of mellowness to his concert.Venkatraman was accompanied by Rahul on the violin and had a threesome laya complement &#8212; Parthasarathi on the mridangam, Venkataramanan on the ganjira and Chennai Ramdas on the ghatam.Rahul&#8217;s alapanas for all the ragas had sterling qualities that had phrases with azhutham. The laya vidwans sensing the short time available to them were content with single avarthana rounds and concluded with a korvai that brought out the qualities of the percussion instruments individually.
