VFor those who listen to film music and music shows on TV channels, Haricharan&#8217;s name and voice might not  be new; he has several popular songs to his credit. An  accomplished Carnatic vocalist,  film forays have not affected the young singer&#8;\u000a217;s attitude to classical music and its time-honoured form. He has taken care of his vocal chords admirably to balance both streams.In the concert at Sri Krishna Gana Sabha, Haricharan provided the limited audience with a neat and well defined performance fully adhering to the genre chosen. &#8216;Karunimpa,&#8217; the Sahana varnam, in two speeds was the opening item of his recital. Following this was a substantially long and  well planned account of Shanmukhapriya, with the  emphasis on melody. &#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam&#8217; preceded the fast &#8216;Janaki Ramana&#8217; (Tyagaraja, Suddha Seemantini). Gowri Manohari  was sketched in a delicious way, Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Gowri Manohara&#8217;  presented with a swara fare. Kalyani  was elaborated  with brilliant swirls and delicate turns.  &#8216;Nidi Chala Sukhama&#8217; was indeed a good choice and the niraval and swaras were reserved for &#8216;Dadi Navaneetha Ksheeramula Rucho&#8217; in place of the usual &#8216;Tamasama Manu Ganga.&#8217; His swara spells are neat and precise but Haricharan seems to be more inclined to alapana.Presenting the songs in their right tenor is Haricharan&#8217;s strong point. &#8216;Enathu Manam Kavalai Enum Irul Soozhndal&#8217; (Harikhambodi), &#8216;Kamalambam&#8217; (Anandabhairavi), &#8216;Karpagame Kan Paarai&#8217; (Madhyamavati), &#8216;Srinivasa Thiruvenkata&#8217; (Hamsanandi) and Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s rhythmic Revati tillana  were offered highlighting the native charm of each composition and raga without any flamboyance.Haricharan&#8217;s supporting artists were also of his age group and were equally sober and confident. The violinist M. Vijay extended his prop in  proper manner. His raga essays also carried the flavour of the vocalist&#8217;s special focus on melody. Percussion was well taken care of by  Vignesh Rajagopal on the mridangam.
