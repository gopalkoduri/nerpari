Prasad, a postgraduate (Radio Diagnosis &#8211; 2001 after MBBS), was with NIMHANS and NIMS before getting into the present assignment, as that of assistant  professor, MIMS, Nellimarla. Three of his CT scan case reports attracted publication in medical journals of high repute like the IJRI. He proudly attributes all these achievements in medical profession to the fact that his first love has been veena music from a tender age which makes him strictly adhere to the daily routine of discerningsadhanaof the same even now.
