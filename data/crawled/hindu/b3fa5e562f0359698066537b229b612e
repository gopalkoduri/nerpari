VThe Vishnu Digambar Jayanti Sangeet Samaroh-2010, held recently, celebrated the 138th birth anniversary of Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, the great apostle of Indian music. The festival, organised by Saraswati Samaj and Gandharva Mahavidyalaya, was held at the Shri Ram Centre. The close proximity of artistes with the music loving audience in this auditorium worked wonders for building the kind of rapport that brought forth qualitative performances by each and every vocalist and instrumentalist during the three-day festival.The traditional invocation &#8220;Jaya Jagdish Hare&#8221; composed by Pandit Vishnu Digamber himself and sung by the well-trained students of Gandharva heralded the festival on the inaugural evening.New voicesThere has been a long-lasting tradition of presenting upcoming talents along with the top-ranking musicians every year. These in due course of time become famous themselves. From Veena Sahasrbuddhe to Ashwini Bhide to Malini Rajurkar, and others &#8212; in the words of Gandharva director Madhup Mudgal, it would take the shape of an epic if one tried listing all those names.This year's new-found voice was Shashwati Mandal Paul who presented ragas Puria Dhanashri and Kedar. Shashwati impressed with her taiyaari in taans, though later on they sounded repetitive.Rais Khan scheduled to play on the inaugural evening could not make it, so Kushal Das from Kolkata played the sitar in his place. Known for his reposeful and melodious music, Kushak was perhaps a better replacement, but he chose Mano-Manjari to begin with, which was an unfamiliar raga for most of the listeners. After the alap-jod-jhaala in Mano-Manjari, he regaled the audience with his melodious rendering of raga Desh. Ram Kumar Mishra gave him commendable support on the tabla.N. Rajam along with her daughter Sangeeta Shankar and granddaughters Nandini and Ragini gave a riveting violin recital playing Raga Miyan Malhar in vilambit Ek tala, medium tempo Teen tala and drut Ada Chautala, the compositions unfolding the nuances of the monsoon raga in great detail. The bandishi thumri &#8220;Na maanoongi&#8221; and the concluding dadra in raga Khamaj had the typical Benarasi andaaz in their melodious rendition, which got matching support from Akram Khan on the tabla.Pandit Ulhas Kashalkar opened his impressive vocal recital with taga Nand along with the famous compositions &#8220;E Bare saiyaan&#8221; and &#8220;Dhan dhan bhaag&#8221; in vilambit and madhya laya Teen tala respectively. Shahana was a good contrast with its comely compositions in Jhap tala and Drut Ek tala before he concluded with the traditional bandish in raga Desh with the typical Agra gayaki flavour.The Sunday morning session featured a melodious Carnatic flute recital by G. Raghuraman who regaled the audience with compositions of Maharaja Swati Tirunal in ragas Revagupti and Riti Gaula, Muttuswami Dikshitar in Purvi Kalyani and a traditional bhajan in Sindhu Bhairavi before concluding with a Lalgudi Jayaraman tillana in raga Revati set to Misra Chapu. Ashvini Bhide soulfully rendered morning ragas like Miyan ki Todi and Jaunpuri before concluding with a traditional jhoola composition in raga Pilu.The final evening had a scintillating tabla solo by &#8216;Tala Yogi' Pandit Suresh Talwalkar, assisted on the tabla by his talented daughter, on the pakhawaj by Onkar Dalvi, on the harmonium by Tanmay and vocal by Ojesh Pratap Singh. He chose Jhap tala for his main recital and performed the most complicated patterns of chhandas, playing hide and seek with the rhythm, concluding with some gems in Teen tala. Pandit Jasraj was &#8216;Ras Raj' in his Jaijaivanti before he delved deep into the meditative depths of raga Darbari. On popular demand he concluded with &#8220;Govindam Gokulanandam&#8221; and reached the crescendo in his typical kirtan style.
