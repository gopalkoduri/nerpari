VAmutham_APRM0027Volumes 1 and 2Carnatic ClassicalKamalamba NavavarnamSeeThe group songs of Sri Muthuswami Dikshitar such as the Navagraha, Kamalamba Navavarna, Abhayamba Navavarna, Vibhakti,  are most distinguished in the repertoire of Carnatic music. In his matchless Kamalamba Navavarna compositions, the poet pays his obeisance to Devi Kamalamba of Tiruvarur. He describes Her in glowing terms as Sarvarakshaakaara, Yogini worshipped by Durvasa, celestial spouse of Lord Siva, personification of flawless beauty, Kalyani and so on.Heart warmingSeetha Rajan is a senior disciple of Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. Her bhava laden rendering of these compositions, savouring the lyrical and musical content has the quality to fill one's heart and senses.Sri Maha Ganapati in Gowla and Balasubramaniam in Surutti are the starters, followed by the Dhyana kriti in Todi, the nine Avaranas in Anandabhairavi, Kalyani, Sankarabharanam, Kambhoji, Bhairavi, Punnagavarali, Sahana, Ghanta, Ahiri and the Mangala kriti in Sriragam. Padma Sugavanam's vocal support is sensitive, while R. K. Sriramkumar (violin) and K. Arunprakash (mridangam) are ideal accompanists.This double album would benefit many who wish to learn these masterpieces in the authentic Patantaram.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
