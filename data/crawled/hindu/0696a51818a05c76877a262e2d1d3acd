VMellifluous strains of music wafted through the air at the festival organised by the Sadana Sadan at the Chinmaya Vidyalaya Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Vadavalli. The programme was unique in quite a few aspects. For one, it did not feature any prominent artistes. The performers were mostly budding artistes looking forward to making a mark in the field of music and  they gave their best. To encourage them, many veterans paid homage to saint composers. The scene was reminiscent of the Tyagaraja Aradhana at Tiruvaiyaru.Some 200 young artistes &#151;   vocalists, violinists, mridangists and veena players &#151;  took part in the two-day event, which drew a huge audience.The kritis sung were in Tamil, which helped everyone understand the meaning of the compositions.Bottom Template Starts
