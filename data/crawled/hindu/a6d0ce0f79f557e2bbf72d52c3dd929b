VAs part of Spic Macay's &#8216;Virasat 2010', T.V. Sankaranarayanan and his son Mahadevan's vocal recital held at an educational institution was in keeping with the objective of the culture promotion among youth.The maestro was at his best with a pleasant smile that never seemed to leave his face even as he rendered the toughest exercises in swara with an ease and style that has come to be identified with him. The opening Arabhi Vigneshwara Shubakara&#8230; (roopaka talam) had a sprinkling of swarakalpana but we had more of his creative outflow as the concert gained momentum. Deekshitar's &#8216; Subramanya&#8230;' in Shudda Dhanyasi followed with a stylistic variation in swara kalpana upholding his musical prowess with pronounced clarity in scaling the cycles even during a speedy flow. Mahadevan kept pace with a rather controlled voice that was nevertheless mellifluous.Papanasam Sivan's composition in Tamil on Lord Venkateswara was a straight one, sans embellishments. The veteran took up Latangi ( Alarmel mangai manaala&#8230;) branding it with the Shankaranarayanan stamp. The neraval was superb with the ghatam and violin playing up to it. It lead to further complex swarakalpana which he spun effortlessly with remarkable fecundity. The swaras moved in series in the ascending and descending order as part of his technical innovation. Thyagaraja's composition in Kaapi was equally delightful to the ear with astounding creativity and tilting raga bhava. The percussionists P. Jayabhaskar (mridangam) and Nemani Somayajulu (ghatam) were at their best. Dinakar's violin support was up to the mark. A Subramanya Bharati's song in Bheempalas ( Vellai taamarai poovil &#8230;) and a sloka on Narayana in Surati was a perfect wrap up of the morning concert at Aurora Business School in the city.One wished veterans like Sankaranarayanan take it upon themselves to educate the young minds with a brief intro to the tala and raga of their repertoire instead of one-liners whenever such occasions arise.
