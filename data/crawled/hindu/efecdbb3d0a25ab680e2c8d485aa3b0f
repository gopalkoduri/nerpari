VAs always, Rangayana has come up with yet another interesting production. Directed by Chidambara Rao Jambe, also the director of Rangayana,Apsare, is based on Kalidasa's play.The period costumes were tasteful, but the dance movements were amateurish. Though the play managed to retain the charm of the original work, replete withshringararasa, it did not match the beauty of Sanskrit language.Expressive eyes and facial expressions of Hulugappa Kattimani as Pururava, particularly during the scene in which he faces the wrath of the queen, was impressive. Nandini's portrayal of Urvashi was convincing. Music played a predominant role in the play.SubliminalVidwan Srikanth's vocal concert at Gokulam Sri Krishna Gana Sabha was a remarkable event. The artiste's approach to ragabhava in Bilahari, Rishabhapriya and Mohana with sublime melody in tristayi sanchari was praiseworthy.The effortless delineation of ragabhava touching the finer fabric of raga Rishabhapriya ("Ghananayadesika", a rare composition of Koteeswaraiyer) even in the ati-mandara stayi and the mnemonic creativity in svarakalpana were the hallmarks of the concert. The other selections like "Sri Chamundeswari" (Bilahari) and Thyagaraja's "Mati-Matiki" (Mohana) were rendered with delightful gamaka prayogas.Vidwan H.N. Bhaskar on violin beautified the ragalakshnana with his refined touch of melody. Dixitar's Manipravala composition ("Venkatachalapathe") was scholarly.Gathi-bedhas of intricate rhythm patterns was well-articulated by G.S. Ramanujam on the mridanga supported by Ramesh on morsing.B.S.S. RAOBottom Template Starts
