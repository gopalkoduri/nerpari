VSrujana Satish is a gold medallist of the A.U. post graduation and holds a doctoral degree in Carnatic music. She is also a senior graded artiste for AIR. She not only presented several research papers at National and International conferences on classical music, but also rendered hundreds of recitals all over South India besides Mumbai. A disciple of her mother V. Gouri Rammohan (A.U. Department of Psychology and Music), she has been honing her skills in the art of exposition of Carnatic music under the tutelage of Sriman Datta. She was featured by VMDA to render a vocal concert at Kalabharathi, Vishakapatnam, last week, ably supported on the violin by K. V. S. Prasad and G. Venkata Rao on mridangam.It turned out to be a refreshing recital. Rendering of Sri Dattaa's composition in the ragam Achala, elaborated version of Ninne Namminanu of Syama Sastry (Todi) and Ragam, Tanam and Pallavi in Brindavana Saranga and swaram in the two tempos in a number of ragas, were special attractions.
