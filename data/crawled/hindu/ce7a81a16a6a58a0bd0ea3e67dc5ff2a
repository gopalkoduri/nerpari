VR.A.Ramamani&#8217;s vocal concert on Saturday, accompanied by M.S.Govindaswami (violin), B. Shivaraman (mridanga), and B. Shashishankar (ghata), was part of the 9th anniversary celebrations of the Suswaralaya College of Music.The performance commenced with a brisk rendering of &#8220;Samidayajuda&#8221;, the adi tala varna in Kedaragoula, followed by the Mysore Vasudevacharya krithi in Goula, &#8220;Pranamamyaham&#8221;, and &#8220;Bhuvaneswariya&#8221; in Mohanakalyani. The artiste came into her own in the alapana of Nagaswaravali. The well-ordered kalpana swaras suffixed to &#8220;Srisankaraguruvaram&#8221;, Maha Vaidyanatha Iyer&#8217;s krithi in rupaka tala, also incorporated a brief shift of the adhara shadja to the madhyama, begetting the Hamsadhwani scale of sa ri ga pa ni sa. The Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Paramathmudu&#8221; in Vagadheeswari preceeded a detailed exposition of Todi. The alapana was peppered with super-fast, complicated passages that gained a measure of serenity at the thara shadja, and the style was reflected to a large extent in the violinist&#8217;s alapana. &#8220;Datsukovalena&#8221; in jhampa tala was adorned with a fine neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Soumithri Thyagaraju&#8221;, culminating in a scintillating thani avarthana.A raga tana pallavi in Kamboji followed. The complex structure of the pallavi was set within the framework of chathurasra rupaka tala, misra gathi - a definitive indication of the artiste&#8217;s calibre. However, a more leisurely treatment would have enabled the audience to savour and appreciate its intricacies in their entirety.**** Senior vocalist D.V. Nagarajan&#8217;s concert under the same auspices was held on Sunday. He was ably accompanied by M. Rajappa (vocal support), Venkatesha Jyoshier (violin), Eshwara Bhat (mridanga), and Prasanna (morsing).The concert opened with &#8220;Viriboni&#8221;, the majestic atta tala varna in Bhairavi, succeeded by the Mysore Vasudevacharya krithi in Kamboji, &#8220;Lambodaram&#8221;. A delectable alapana of Sreeranjani was followed by &#8220;Marubalka&#8221;, notable for the plethora of sangathis at &#8220;Jarachora&#8221; in the anupallavi, and the ensuing fluent kalpana swaras. The first raga of the concert, Bhairavi, was featured once again in a raga tana pallavi that underscored its somber beauty and the infinite possibilities within its prescribed parameters.The expansion of the pallavi, &#8220;Neerajadalanayana&#8221; in adi tala and the exhaustive kalpana swaras established beyond doubt the artiste&#8217;s uncompromising classicism, discipline, and devotion to tradition. An occasional unevenness of voice was overshadowed by an unerring sense of propriety and proportion born of long years of experience.
