VGARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMThe men and  women  behind the Hindustani Sangeet Samaroh of Chennai, with their noble mission to put the spotlight on younger stalwarts in the field, surely have their hearts in the right place.With better publicity, the event would perhaps have attracted bigger crowd. But the event certainly did not go unnoticed.The constant drone from the pedestal fans in the background put a question mark on the SGS Sabha as a venue for any musical event.If these are not bad enough,  the  main morning programme on Sunday commenced a good 45 minutes behind schedule because of an extended inaugural ceremony, the point of which is not obvious after Saturday's  inauguration.Kumar Das, vocalist from Darwar, featured as the main artiste on August 5 took the audience to  a different plane when he began  Brindavansarang. If he was upset by the delayed start &#151;  where was the need for an inauguration that morning when a full-fledged opening ceremony had taken place the previous evening, one wondered &#151;  it was not evident."Mohanki Murli baje," the opening line followed a short alaap and when he wrapped up the raga within half an hour, after a second bandish, it was obvious that the time lost was beginning to affect the proceedings.Kumar Das then took up  Multani, moving effortlessly and repeatedly into the higher octave. The resemblance to  Pt. Bhimsen Joshi and the late Kumar Gandharv was quite perceptible.The composition in  Mishrkalavati by Guruswami Kalkeri: "Dhyanmado sriguruvina," and then a Meera bhajan in  Kirvani "Prabhuji manmane jabtare," concluded the proceedings.Ishwar Murugeri on the harmonium, Gurusangappa Gunjal on the tabla and Veereshwar Madari on the violin lent able support to the vocalistBottom Template Starts
