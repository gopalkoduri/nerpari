VThe MLV Rasikar Mandram conducts special programmes every year on M.L. Vasanthakumari&#8217;s memory day with  a music concert.This year, the mandram hosted a concert by Varalakshmi Anandakumar, who belongs to the D.K. Jayaraman school, at Sastri Hall. A highlight  was that Varalakshmi chose songs and ragas close to the late musician&#8217;s heart.She began the concert  with GNB&#8217;s Andolika varanm &#8216;Nee daya rada&#8217;; MLV had made this varnam and raga very popular.Her detailed rendition of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Raga sudha rasa&#8217; with alapana and complex swarakalpana was  memorable.Varalakshmi impressed the audience with supplementary swaras to the varnam agreeably framed keeping in mind the composer GNB and his famous disciple MLV and their inimitable style of structuring intricate combinations with several forms of jandai and tattu swaras.&#8216;Saranu siddhi vinayaka&#8217; of Purandaradasa in Sowrashtram was presented next.Varalakshmi kept a tight control on her raga vinyasas due to time factor; her sub-major Ranjani followed with GNB&#8217;s &#8216;Ranjani niranjani&#8217; with a package of well knit swaras at &#8216;Kanja dala lochani&#8217;.Between the main raga Todi (&#8216;Sri krishnam bhaja manasa&#8217;) and Ranjani, there was the sprightly &#8216;Nena runchara napai&#8217; in Simhavahini.Varalakshmi might not be an overzealous singer but she is definitely diligent and her style carries the evidence of her perception of  the raga&#8217;s depth, shades and range.Bringing forth many of the customary and creative phrases of Todi, she could indulge quite a bit in neraval and swaras at &#8216;Sanku chakra gada&#8217;, lending that stamp of MLV&#8217;s zesty approach.Varalakshmi concluded her concert with &#8216;Venkatachala nilayam&#8217; in Sindhbhairavi.Her recital was a significant tribute to MLV. Additionally, the concert was presented at a brisk pace, which was another hallmark of MLV.Poorna Vaidyanathan, being a meticulous violinist and sincere follower of the artist she accompanies, made her presence conspicuous in all raga essays and swara sallies.Her lively additions in Andolika and Todi were harmonising with the vocalist&#8217;s perception.Kallidaikuruchi Sivakumar kept the acceptably racy gait of the concert and also treated rasikas with a brief but perfect tani.
