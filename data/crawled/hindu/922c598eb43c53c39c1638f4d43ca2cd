VMaharajapuram SrinivasanSrishti&#8217;s Carnatica, Chennai.MRP Rs. 125Carnatic music is to a large extent a raga-based system. Be it alapana, kriti,thanam, niraval or swara rendition the raga&#8217;s hues in all these segments should be presented so as to create a tranquil atmosphere. This atmosphere can be created by the artistes provided they look beyond the mere scales of the melody and understand its Jeevan (life). This is what  legends such as Veena Dhanammal did and were able to offer the quintessence of Carnatic melodies.The recently released compact disc of the Maharajapuram lineage by Srishti&#8217;s Carnatica contains a part of a live concert of Maharajapuram Srinivasan and his son Maharajapuram Ganesh Viswanathan.The disc opens with Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s samashti charanam krithiSri Rama Saraswathiin Nasamani a vivadhi raga. Nasamani is known as Nasikabhooshani in the sampoorna paddhati. This composition in praise of Goddess Lalithambika is sung with a clear understanding of the vivadhi swaras. The vocalists have presented an alapana of Thodi, which initially is a healthy dissertation anchored by phrases which are meaningful. This later on  becomes a sawal jawab exercise between the singers. The phrases sung by Srinivasan are duplicated by Ganesh, leaving no room for the violinist to follow the main singer.Tyagaraja&#8217;sDasukovalenain Misra Jampa is sung adhering to a good patanthara. The violinist responds to these exercises confidently. The mridangist plays an appropriate and crisp thani avarthanam for the tala cycle of 10 beats.Mannargudi Sambasiva Bhagavathar&#8217;s Maand creation,Neerajadalanayana, which was a favourite with Maharajapuram Santhanam is sung joyously. It is praiseworthy that Srinivasan concludes the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam of this song asNeerajainstead of justNias sung by many, conveying the meaning &#8212; lotus.
