VG.SWAMINATHANDedicating her concert to Muthuswamy Dikshitar, Suganda Kalamegam offered quality music. Her recital at Narada Gana Sabha bore the stamp of tradition. On the whole it was an educative experience.The veteran showcased some rare compositions and this included  `Raktha Ganapathim' in Mohanam (with a spry chittaswaram) in praise of Ganapathy of Thiruvananthapuram, `Sri Dum Durge' in Sriranjani on Durga of Tiruvarur, `Pahimam Ratnaachala Nayaka' in Mukhari devoted to Ratnachaleswarar in Aganda Kaveri near Kulithalai and `Sundareswaram' in Suddha Vasantha sung on Madurai Sundareswarar.They were remarkable with perfect raga essays. With a single phrase, Suganda captured the essence of the raga.  The method adopted was not linking of  phrases but a full-fledged linear development of melody.Outstanding qualitiesSuch profound contributions come from rich knowledge, practice and experience. Short essays of Sriranjani, Saranga (Arunachala natham) and Mukhari and the main Sankarabharanam (the popular Akshaya linga vibho) stood out for these qualities. Creativity marked the swara segments in Mohanam, Sriranjani, Saranga and Sankarabharanam. Suganda also included well-known Dikshitar songs such as `Angaarakam' (Suruti), `Santhanaramaswaminam' (Hindolavasantham), `Akhilandeswari' (Dwijavanti), `Kanchadalayadakshi' (Kamalamanohari).It was a young group that accompanied the veteran &#151;   Srikanth (violin), Arun Prakash (mridangam) and Purushotham (kanjira).The trio was finely tuned to the mood of the concert and the calibre of the main artist.Bottom Template Starts
