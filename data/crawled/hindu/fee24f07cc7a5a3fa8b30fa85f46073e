VSYED MUTHAHAR SAQAFVeteran singer K. Vageesh gave a scintillating performance at the FGN hall under the auspices of Rasika Ranjana Sabha, Tiruchi, recently. Vageesh commenced the concert with a stanza from Kamba Ramayanam on  Hanuman, "Anjile Ondru Petran" inMalayamarutham, followed by the varnam,  "Hanumantham." This was followed by another of his composition, "Ganapathi Thalai" with an  introductory piece of Mahakavi Bharati's "Enakku Vendum Varangalai Isaippen Kelai Ganapathi" in  Hamsadhwani.Vageesh kept the devotional spirit alive in each of the carefully chosen pieces. ``Sakala Grahabala'' (devarnama of  Purandaradasa) in  Atana, ``Nee Dayarada'' of Tyagaraja in Vasanta Bhairvai, "Nanda Goapala,'' a composition of  Muthuswami Dikshitar in  Yamuna Kalyani and ``Padumanabhan Maruga'' of Papanasam Sivan in Nagaswaravali  all flowed in quick succession.Elaborate renditionThe bhavanubhava of the performer expressed in each song captivated the audience. The elaborate rendering of  Subha Pantuvarali in the main piece of  Koteswara Iyer's rare kriti, "Velane Nee Allal Thunai Verillai"  and the flowery flow of kalpanaswaras kept the  audience spell-bound.In the concluding session, Vageesh sang a kriti on Sri Varada Perumal of Kanchipuram in Varam, followed by a composition of Tiruchi `Paarathan' in Kavadi Chindu.  With a devarnama of  Purandaradasa rendered in tillana style in  Brindavana Saranga, the concert came to a close.  T. H. Vasantha's violin was smooth and pleasing. Salem S. Srinivasan on the mridangam and Andanallur Renganathan on the ghatam gave a riveting performance.Bottom Template Starts
