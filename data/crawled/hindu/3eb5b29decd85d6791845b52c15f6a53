V&#8220;T he eyes looked up in prayer; they looked down in bashful (romance); and sideways in style.&#8221; This was one of the playful verses Hindustani vocalist Pandit Channulal Mishra rendered at his recital for the Friday Review November Fest. His singing was distinguished by all three dimensions.The audience came to Mishra's recital prepared to be introduced to a kind of music quite different from the branded products that have become the norm today. True, this Kirana Gharana veteran, groomed by martinet Abdul Ghani Khan, has never made a secret of having garnered features from other schools of music. But not haphazardly &#8212; after all, he is also the disciple of the master musicologist Thakur Jaidev Singh &#8212; but to enrich his presentation. And the audience did get to experience this multi-fold absorption.In his first recital in Chennai, it was obvious that Mishra could unify these diverse strands into a pattern of his own.He also demonstrated their differences with authority, as he did in his thumri in Mishra Khammaj (&#8216;Vyakul bhayi braj'). First identifying the methods of murki and pukar, his badhat (improvised development) detailed the lyricism of the Benarasi purab ang, the glitter of Punjab and the folk lilt of Gaya. The thumri also provided a fine example of his passion for the sahitya, which he shared with listeners amidst the singing. The flow of &#8216;O Shyam, don't play the flute in my lane. If you do, don't enslave me with your music, and don't you leave me after making me your own&#8230;' was coloured by yearning melody.Spontaneity rulesMishra began with a brief alaap in Puryakalyan, showing the right pitching of the rishabh note in the raag, differentiating it from the same note in allied raag Marwa. He punctuated his vilambit khyal (&#8216;Aaj sovana') and the faster chhota khyal (&#8216;Bahut din beete'), with verbal explanations of their segments from akaar to sargam and taan, at times even the variability of laya counts within the same rhythm cycle. Accelerating the pace, he skipped and leapt over the swaras in several gatis. Notably, he never overdid anything, even as he spontaneously tossed in the tihaayis of rhythm and lyric phrases, so much part of Hindustani music, without undue affectation.The fun came with Hamsadhwani and Muthuswami Dikshitar's kriti &#8216;Vatapi Ganapatim.' Mishra said he learnt it by listening to loudspeakers at the Marina Beach 20 years ago! He actually sang the famous pallavi sangatis with Carnatic gamakas, acquitting himself creditably in the anupallavi, and rambling into a few ad hoc lines from the charanam before plunging into a Hindustani counterpart in &#8216;Aye sajan more mandirwa.'For the rest, Mishra decided to display Benares wares such as chaiti and kajri, a Diwali song in Aada chautal &#8211; always opting for the rare over the familiar. The hori provided an eerie surprise with Siva (and his bhootaganas) supplanting Krishna and the gopis dancing with the damaru, splashing ashes and flames, serpents spurting &#8216;colours' all across the graveyard! A Kabir bhajan rounded off the evening.Childlike charmAgainst the striking backdrop of a lighting design that suggested a tawny sunset on a blue green river, Mishra's stage presence was filled with a childlike charm. His voice retained sweetness despite fatigue towards the end. And even then the urge to communicate the special merits of the lyrics of Benares and his joy in rhythm remained unflagging.But listeners were left wishing there had been less talk and more music. Not stopping with an introduction, the singer chattered intermittently, converting parts of his concert into a lec-dem.In this eagerness to share the beauty of poetry and technique finesse, Mishra lost out on mood evocation and in depth exploration. Often even the singing of the lines sounded as if they were quotations in speech.It seemed he could not lose himself in the melody and transcend to a self forgetful level of pure music &#8212; all the more regrettable because a sudden poignant phrase in Khammaj or Nand or Bhairavi took your breath away, offering tantalising glimpses of substance lurking below the surface.
