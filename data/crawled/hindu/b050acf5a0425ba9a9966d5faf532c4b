VShanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha&#8217;s annual musical extravaganza, &#8216;Isai Amudham,&#8217; held at Velayuthaswamy Thirumana Mandapam, Tirupur, was marked by its characteristic taste and class this year also. Right from the backdrop design (It was a madhubani painting of Sri Krishna&#8217;s Rasaleela this year), the comfortable seating arrangements and the quality of the music system, (not to forget the  canteen), made this mega festival, something special. And of course, the calibre of the artists is the prime consideration.On the inaugural day, Mannargudi M.S.K. Shankaranarayanan made an auspicious beginning with his three-hour nagaswaram concert accompanied by Thiruvalappuththur T.A. Kaliamurthy and Mannargudi M.R. Vasudevan on special thavils. The sabha&#8217;s maiden venture of featuring a full-length nagaswaram concert met with whole-hearted audience support.The ragas Karnaranjani (&#8216;Vaanchatonu Naa&#8217; by Muthaiah Bhagavatar) and Kalyani (&#8216;Unnaiyallal Vere Gathiyillai Ammaa&#8217; by Papanasam Sivan) were depicted with great depth and sweetness. There were scintillating fireworks during the &#8216;Special thavil thani.&#8217;No one knows what techniques Lord Krishna used to produce the intoxicating melody through his flute. But S.Shashank, who is a young legend himself, and has the honour of having been centre stage with many  legends worldwide, has truly developed a technique of his own that is based on experiments and consistent hard work. He uses many flutes with different pitches and brings the effect he desires by using different fingering techniques. He has been greatly influenced by the flute legend Mali.Having learnt vocal music from  veterans such as  R.K.Srikantan and Palghat K.V.Narayanaswamy, Shashank seems to &#8216;sing&#8217; through his flute. His humility and respect for the audience are phenomenal. The very first varnam (Sriragam) was the choice of the audience. The multi-speed rendering won a thunderous applause. The listeners sat up with greater expectations and how Shashank obliged them!&#8216;Manavyaalakincharaa&#8217; in Nalinakanti and &#8216;Evarani Nirnayinchiri Raa&#8217; in Devamruthavarshini had the usual zing in them. He began Ranjani in a soft and smooth manner and moved on to great heights and greater speed. Sure enough, &#8216;Nagumomu&#8217; in Abheri  was the main piece and Shashank&#8217;s swaraprastaras in quick succession reminded one of the showers of Parijatha flowers when one shakes the tree. The whole of the lighter session was pure &#8216;Listeners&#8217; choice.&#8217; By applauding Shashank at the right places, the audience proved  that what a rasika needs is an ear for music. Nagai R. Sriram on the violin was as tender and tempestuous as Shashank. Patri Sathish Kumar (mridangam) and Thiruppunithura Radhakrishnan (ghatam) vied with each other in creating rhythmic waves.T.R. Ramanathan, secretary of the sabha, broke into a poetic analogy while felicitating the artists. He pointed out that the holes in the flute and nagaswaram can be equated to the obstacles in our lives and that just as music can be produced by closing and opening the holes in the instrument, we can fill our lives with joy by knowing how to handle the obstacles.Anuradha Sriram made a clean conquest the following day. The first half of the concert was purely traditional. She poured out the essence of Lalitha and sang &#8216;Hiranmayim Lakshmim&#8217; by Dikshitar. Ritigowla, another tender raga, was presented with equal warmth preceding &#8216;Guruvaayoorappane Appan&#8217; by Ambujam Krishna. The second half was full of soft ghazals, moving viruttams and devout bhajans. She carried the audience with her by giving them what they wanted and with her friendly interactions.
