VNishikant Barodekar gave a solo tabla recital at SGS Sabha hall, as part of Ganayogi Hindustani Music festival, which was jointly organised by SGS Sabha and Sri Guru Gnanayogi Panchakshara Sangeeth Yogashram Trust (ChennaI). He was accompanied by Sri\u000a Katti on the harmonium. The tabla had a quiet introduction in the athi vilambit gati in teen thaal, as the short alap on the harmonium (Raag Puriya Dhanasri) ended.The hallmark of Nishikant&#8217;s playing was his desire to fill the gaps between the strokes, even in its most languid pace, with  skilful embellishments that suited the gats chosen. Even as a variety of gaits and styles were presented, one noticed  the maintenance of evenness in sound in the Bayan and Dayan drums.The clarity and perfection in strokes at all varying speeds and the different Gharanas &#8211; Dilli, Farooqabad, Ajrada, Benares and Punjabi &#8212;  that he demonstrated by prefacing them with appropriate bols, were lessons that were instructive. One only wished the concert had continued for a longer hour as the audience  seemed to be relishing every moment of it.The Ajrada style of playing with the ring and index finger alone which he repeatedly produced had both authority and class. If you went in search of mannerisms or hard-beats, they were conspicuous by their absence. There was the azhutham even as he presented many mukdas and embedded chathusram in tisram during the first phase of the concert.
