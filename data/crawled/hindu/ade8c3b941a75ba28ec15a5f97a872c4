VGARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMThe timing of the recent workshop on the famed Kamalaamba Navaavarana kritis of Muthuswami Dikshitar, the renowned 19th century composer of Tiruvarur, which coincided with the Dasara Navaratri celebrations, carries a special significance for musicians and music lovers who continue to debate the place of language and lyrics in their creative musical inspirations.These kritis, which Dikshitar composed in praise of goddess Kamalaamba of Tiruvarur, providing deep insights into the `srichakra' cult of worship of shakti, possess an obvious religious significance. But at the end of the six-day event organised by Devaganavali, Nada Inbam and the trust named after Dr. Pappu Venugopalarao even agnostics among the audience would have gone away with a firm conviction that a grasp of the text, context and sub-text of a composition must form a necessary prelude, if not a precondition, for a meaningful musical rendition as well as appreciation.The `navaavarana' kritis, which deal with the intricacies of the nine enclosures of the `srichakra,' are in fact 11 in all, inclusive of the opening and closing benedictions.Poetic bent of mindIt is not surprising that Dikshitar set the 11 kritis in as many raagaas with the first piece in Hanumatodi and the final one in ragam Sri. But he reveals a poetic bent of mind when he set the first eight of the 11 kritis each in a different declension of the proper noun Kamalaamba and the ninth in all the eight declensions.The workshop commenced daily with a group chanting of the Lalita Sahasranamam, followed by the singing of Dikshitar's invocation kriti on lord Vinayaka by vidushi R. Vedavalli and her disciples.The subsequent audio-visual presentation by Pappu Venugopalarao focused on two `navaavarana' kritis on each day, highlighting the characteristics of each enclosure (`aavarana'), associated deities and their divine powers.The selection of the compositions on Lord Vinayaka were appropriately those composed by Dikshitar at the Tiruvarur shrine itself.The organisers should draw added inspiration from the fact that their pioneering effort coincided with the 50th year of the first publication in Tamil of the "Kamalaambika Mahaatmeeyam," in 1956, by N.Subramanya Iyer, founder of Guhanandamandali.Bottom Template Starts
