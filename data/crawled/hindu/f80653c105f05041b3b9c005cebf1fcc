VUstad Mahmud Mirza&#8217;s recent recital at the Triveni Kala Sangam auditorium before a jam-packed audience was indeed a treat to the lovers of chaste classical music. One has to compliment Ustad Sharif Bharati of the Dilli gharana and his cultural organisation Dehli Sangeet Sabha for inviting Ustad Mirza all the way from London to perform on this occasion. The artiste  commenced his recital with the chaste raga Puriya Dhanashri  of proven values and a befitting melody for the evening. His alap-jod was remarkable for the fine display of the raga&#8217;s &#8216;vakra&#8217; or  criss-cross format. His plucking of the strings and movements over the frets was a delight for being executed with a slight tinge of gamakas, the modulation that was reminiscent of his uncle Ustad Haider Hussain. He then  switched over to a slow tempo Masitkhani gat-toda set to a 16-beat Teen tala.The &#8216;upaj&#8217; or improvisations were executed with utmost spontaneity and landed mostly on the mukhda &#8212; the opening phrase. So were the tihais and most of the variations, all of which are the hallmark of his style, known as the Masitkhani-baaz.The style is imbibed from his maternal uncle the late Ustad Haider Hussain, the sitar maestro and doyen of Jaipur&#8217;s Masitkhani baaz. The legendary maestro took Mahmud as his disciple when he was just six years old and trained him for a good number of years to become an exponent of this unique style. This critic had the good fortune of listening to the late maestro performing on the stage and private concerts wearing the Rajasthani turban and regaling his listeners by executing with utmost ease some of the most difficult nuances, particularly the &#8216;kritans&#8217;, &#8216;zamzamas&#8217; and &#8216;sapaat taans&#8217;.After the demise of his uncle, Mahmud came under the tutelage of the renowned scholar-musician, the late Pandit Jeewanlal Mattoo, who was the founder of All India Radio&#8217;s first national orchestra (Akashvani Vadya Vrinda) which later came under the full charge of Pandit Ravi Shanker Shankar. The sterling qualities of his training were evident when he topped the Junior Classical Instruments list in a competition organised by All India Radio to coincide with the first Radio Sangeet Sammelan in 1954.The drut or fast Teen tala Razakhani composition presented by Mahmud was redolent with liltingly inserted phrasings. He concluded with slow and fast Teen tala compositions in the colourful melody of raga Jhinjhoti with scores of liltingly deployed variations that were a treat for the gathering of music lovers.Pandit Subhash Nirvan on the tabla provided excellent accompaniment and his own rounds of solo variations were scintillatingly executed and typical of his old and reputed Dilli gharana of eminent tabla maestros.Mahmud&#8217;s popularity is due, besides the excellent technique, mainly to his strict adherence to chaste music. His repugnance for &#8216;hybrid music&#8217; drove him from the world of the silver screen which he entered after giving up his position with AIR. Finding few opportunities in his homeland, he set his sights on foreign lands where he gradually built up a large following of Hindustani classical music lovers. He performs frequently in Britain, France and the United States.&#8226; From childhood, Mahmud Mirza trained under his maternal uncle the late Ustad Haider Hussain, the legendary sitar maestro and doyen of Jaipur&#8217;s Masitkhani baaz (style).&#8226; After the demise of his uncle, Mahmud trained with the renowned scholar-musician, the late Pandit Jeewanlal Mattoo, founder of All India Radio&#8217;s first national orchestra (Akashvani Vadya Vrinda)&#8226; In 1954 Mahmud topped the Junior Classical Instruments list in a competition organised by All India Radio.&#8226; After working in All India Radio, he briefly entered the world of film music but gave it up due to his known repugnance for &#8216;hybrid&#8217; music and strict adherence to &#8216;chaste&#8217; music.&#8226; He is currently settled in the U.K.
