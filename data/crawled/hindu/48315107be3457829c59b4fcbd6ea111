VThree very promising girls figured in two vocal concerts organised by Vignana Samithi, held last week at its premises at Anand Nagar community hall. The first was an hour long concert by Shyamala Ravi. She is now a graded artiste of AIR. Gifted with \u000aa melodious and soft voice, she set her repertoire well with some select numbers of whichPahimam Parvathi Parameswariin Mohana of Dikshitar was the main attraction. She detailed the raga reasonably well and went through all the technical facets of the concert revealing her grip on Carnatic music.Nannu Brova Neekinta Taamasamaof Thyagaraja in Natakuranji was a pleasant rendition. Swathi Tirunal&#8217;sDevadeva Jagadeeswarain Poorvikalyani was another appealing number. Of the end pieces Meerabhajan was notable.The Smitha Sisters &#8212; Madhumitha and Sushmitha performed the main concert of the evening. The twins have completed diploma courses in music in Telugu University under the tutelage of noted violinist of the Dwaram family, Poosarla Manorama. D. Vardhani is their present teacher.One notable quality of the twins was their ability to blend their voices perfectly.It was indeed a confident presentation.  Opening with Begada varnam followed by an invocationPranamamyahamin Gowla, the sisters went for Thyagaraja&#8217;s popular compositionTeliyaleru Raamain Dhenuka. They combined well even in expression of Sahitya with one voice.Baagayanayyain Chandrajyoti,Marugelarain Jayanthisree andPaalayamamin Kannada of Deekshitar were neat kriti renditions. For a change Narayana Teertha&#8217;sTharangamin Kalyani, Misrachapu Talam, was chosen as their major presentation. Swathi Tirunal&#8217;sBhogeendra Saayinamin Kuntala varali and Dhanasri Tillana were notable end pieces that concluded the show.Pavan Singh on violin and R. Srikant on mridangam lent support to both the concerts. Srikant&#8217;s tani avartanam was good.
