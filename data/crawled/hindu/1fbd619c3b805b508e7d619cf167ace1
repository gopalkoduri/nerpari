VSHE IS restful while singing. Restless  while contemplating in music. Ashwini Bhide Deshpande, at Dashashwmedh Ghat in Varanasi recently,  was in her performance dignified, rendering two ragas. Complacency was there in foreground, but in the sub-conscious, background was unfolding mystically.Starting  with Dakshinatya Ke Basant, a Carnatic  raga, she emphasised her tonal concern and tendency to stay in significant swaras inherited from her mother and Guru Manik Bhide. But the effect was different when she enunciated the raga Tilak Kamod. Both Nishad, how she feels and expresses, were stylised in terms of its vibrant colours. This kind of Sruti does not have anxiety to happen but it takes time to express."I used to allow a restful ambience in my mind while entering into performance," says Ashwini. But she is in the midst of pure musical deliverance. She feels young and learning, and practice her own when teaches. "Students come to me regularly but I never teach them. I have told them to learn with their capacity and talent when I am singing. Receiving end is the thing," she explains. Spic Macay performance, Ganga Mahotsav and now in this programme of Ganga Sewa Nidhi, this was her third frequent visit to Varanasi. "It is a different kind of experience. What I feel here is musical and spiritual fulfilment," she adds.Bandish on CDAshwini's latest success has been the recently-published book "Raga Rachananjali" having 84 bandish in different ragas which has been composed and sung by her in a CD sold along with the book. Pandit Ravi Shankar writes  -   "Having learnt many old compositions, she has been able to retain the spirit of the tradition through the dialects she has used as well as pay attention to subject matter!" The Bandish has been described here as the `paathya' or the `logogenic' element. The attempt is significant and attention- seeking, which comes to the fore as Ashwini says, "May be, it is a new turn."Bottom Template Starts
