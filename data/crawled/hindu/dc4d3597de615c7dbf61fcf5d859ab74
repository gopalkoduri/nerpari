VA vocal duet by Chithkala Sathish and Vathsala Sunil was part of the Navaratri celebrations at the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam in Malleswaram, Bangalore. They were accompanied by C.A. Nagaraj (violin), T.N. Ramesh (mridanga), and Shree Rangarajan (ghata).The first item of the concert was Muthaiah Bhagavathar&#8217;s daru varna in Khamach raga and adi tala, &#8220;Maate Malayadhwaja Pandya Samjaathe&#8221;, a difficult piece, which was presented neatly with the swaras and corresponding jathis and sahitya in two speeds.&#8220;Varasiddhivinayakam&#8221; in Nattai which followed, featured a few crisp kalpanaswaras. &#8220;Akhilandeshwari&#8217;, the Dikshithar krithi in Dwijavanthi served as prelude to a brief but pleasant alapana of Keeravani, Muthaiah Bhagavathar&#8217;s &#8220;Amba Vani&#8221; set to adi tala and a few kalpanaswaras at &#8220;Varaveenapaani&#8221;.The rendition of GNB&#8217;s &#8220;Nee paadamegathi&#8221; in Nalinakanthi was remarkable for the kalpanaswaras that highlighted the melodious vakra structure of its scale, and was succeeded by &#8220;Ranjani Niranjani&#8221;, in Ranjani, another GNB composition.Shankarabharana was taken up for a fairly detailed alapana in an unpretentious style that conformed to the traditional raga swaroopa, mirrored in the violinist&#8217;s mellow accompaniment. There seemed to be some difficulty in the negotiation of tara sthayi passages, which were not clearly audible. &#8220;Sarojadalanethri&#8221;, the Syama Sastri kriti in adi tala was rendered beautifully and enriched by neraval and kalpanaswaras at &#8220;Saamagaanavinodini&#8221;, and a tani avarthana in keeping with the tenor and duration of the item.&#8220;Kanjadalayathakshi&#8221; in Kamalamanohari, &#8220;Jagododdharana&#8221; in Kapi and a Hindi bhajan were some of the compositions in the concluding segment of the concert.****Bangalore is justly renowned as a hub of prolific cultural activity spanning diverse genres and styles. The Carnatic music concerts held in various localities of the city maintain a uniformly high standard that is a tribute to performers and connoisseurs alike.However, one suggestion would be that greater attention be bestowed on the accoustics at the concert venue, and the balancing of accompanying instruments. Some of the halls used for concerts are not equipped for the purpose, and the problem can be mitigated to a certain extent by adjustments in the sound system.The voice is frequently overshadowed by the instruments, and its true quality and range cannot be gauged. The subtle inflections and nuances, and the bhava sought to be conveyed to the listener, are lost due to faulty bass and treble adjustments, and uneven volume control. Often the words are indistinct and the beauty of the composition is marred. A little consideration to these aspects  will enhance listening pleasure and generate a better understanding and appreciation of the efforts of the artistes.
