VT. K. GANAPATHYWith pleasing voice modulation, Haripriya and Shanmughapriya displayed their musical wares with liveliness and verve at the concert held under the aegis of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore,  tackling their programme with nice coordination and camaraderie. "Ninnukori" varnam in Vasantha, setting the pace at commencement, was followed by "Tatvamariya Tharama" in Reetigowlai sprinkled with charming swaras and "Ennadu Jootu" in Kalavati.Haripriya's alapana of Sahana was marked for purity and paatantharam and its appeal sprang from its presentation. The alapana lured the rasikas with its vakra sancharas with appropriate brighas and gamakas. The kriti, "Sree Kamalambika" was a neat rendition reflective of its philosophic contents.Shanmughapriya's raga delineation of Hamsanandi for "Paahi jagajanani" confined to mantarasthayi failed to impress for lack of tonal trimness and it was a launching pad for the younger sister to take it on its curvaceous paths in tharasthayi. The composition was embellished with catchy swaras.Their raga vinyasam of Madhyamavathi for RTP - Paalintsu Bhagavathi Siva Yuvati Madhyamavathi - had a good degree of novelty. The raga sancharas in Saaramathi, Revati and Madhuvanti with corresponding alterations in sahityam crowned by a tani went down well with the audience.The package of songs included, "Nambikkettavar" (Hindolam), "Chalamelara" (Margahindolam), "Jagata" in Hindolavasantham and a viruttam.Sivaraman's silky and velvety original essays in his solo violin versions of Sahana, Hamsanandi, Madhyamavati and swara repartees enhanced the quality of the concert.  The rhythmic format of Balaji (mridangam) and Murali (ghatam) was arresting.Bottom Template Starts
