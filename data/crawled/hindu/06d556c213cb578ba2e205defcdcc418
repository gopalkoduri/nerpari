VIn this compact disc, brothers K.N. Sashikiran and P.Ganesh have chosen the Andolikavarnam(Needayarada) of the legendary G.N.Balasubramanian as the opening number. Thisvarnamis an apt curtain raiser to the fare which follows. One of the most moving compositions of Tyagaraja,Teliyaleru Ramain Dhenuka is rendered with the contours of the melody not being trespassed with. Amongst the various compositions of Tyagaraja in Sriranjani,Brochevarevarestands out due to its different structure.Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s Kannada masterpieceSri Mathrubhuthamin praise of Thayumanaswamy of the Rockfort temple at Tiruchirapalli, is sung true to the patanthara of T.Brinda. The piece de resistance of this disc is Tyagaraja&#8217;s Saramathi krithiMokshamugaladha.Thevinyasaof Saramathi by Sashikiran is a careful one without deviating from theragalakshana.  The violinist V.V.Ravi&#8217;s portrayal of Saramathi falls very pleasantly on the ears. Percussive accompaniment is provided on the mridangam by Thiruvarur Vaidyanathan.The concluding Javali in BehagSamayamidheis soothing and the voice modulation of the artists reminds one of John Higgins&#8217; presentation of this javali.Carnatica BrothersSrishti.s carnatica P Ltd.Devotional CD (Price: Rs. 125)PVK
