VN. Jayalakshmi Sarma presented a vocal concert to a packed audience at a programme held under the banner &#8216;Eppadi Paadinaro&#8217; organised by the Rasika Ranjana Sabha, Tiruchi, in association with Sri Krishna Sweets.She started with a brisk rendering of the popular Annamacharya kriti &#8216;Vande Vasudevam&#8217; in Sri ragam. &#8216;Sobillu&#8217; of Tyagaraja followed with engaging swara passages.Jayalakshmi sang a Papanasam Sivan song in Mukhari (&#8216;Saranam Ayyappa&#8217;). The nuances of pantuvarali raga was well brought out in her alapana and the niraval, swaraprastharam for the Dikshitar kriti, &#8216;Visalakshim&#8217; were  enjoyable. Her rendition of the rare Tyagaraja piece &#8216;Samayamu Ae Marage&#8217; in Kalkada preceded by a brief raga alapana deserves mention.&#8216;Entarani Tanaku&#8217; of Tyagaraja was the main piece. The detailed alapana of Harikhambodi brought out with dignity all the beautiful phrases of this difficult raga.Jayalakshmi sang &#8216;Mahadeva Siva Sambho&#8217; of Thanjavur Sankara Iyer, &#8216;Janasammodini&#8217; a composition of her guru Embar Raghavasimhan, &#8216;Pullaaippiravi&#8217; of Oothukadu Venkatakavi and &#8216;Panimathi Mukhibale&#8217; of Swati Tirunal.An Oonjal song on Goddess Ranganayaki (by Shakti Charanan) was well received.Jayalakshmi was ably supported on the violin by T. H. Vasantha and Salem Srinivasan on the mridangam (both of them are graded artists from All India Radio, Tiruchi).Vasantha&#8217;s Pantuvarali and Harikhambodi were laudable. Salem Srinivasan&#8217;s various rhythmic patterns during his tani avartanam were commendable. Jayalakshmi concluded her recital with a Purandaradasa Devarnama in Brindavana Saranga.
