VWhen a musician perfectly understands the tone and tenor of a particular raga in the right perspective and crafts his expression in such a manner that it does not disturb its core character, the raga will shine in all its glory.Kasturirangan's Charukesi treatise was not just lustrous but also a statement of the singer's clear vision of the raga chosen. His unhurried alapana with finely etched akaras at the right places was appealing in every way. Charukesi was wholesome and expressive of its depth with distinction. The Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Aada Modi Galada' was rendered in an unhurried manner and the initial swaras, to build up the tempo for the pallavi at the end, prepared the listeners for a poignant climax. So when Kasturirangan started weaving his swaras centring on the panchamam, the right tempo was created for the flawless finale.Different approachIn the Charukesi exercise, Kasturirangan was inventive. But, his approach to Kalyani was entirely different.The deliberate swings from lower to upper regions and the slightly cluttered and desolate exposition of phrases, though creative and impressive, did not help to enhance the quality. But then, Kalyani is as resolute as gold. In whatever manner it is burnished, it will shine and it did that evening.The raga prelude was followed by Swati Tirunal's &#8220;Pankaja Lochana,&#8221; which projected Kalyani in its full vivacity. The niraval and swara sessions on &#8216;Brindavanakritha' were succinct.Kasturirangan cleverly arranged his concert with well selected numbers, presented well too. Between the opening varnam (Sri) and concluding thillana (Sindubhairavi) his space fillers had the breezy &#8220;Manasukaruga&#8221; in Hamsadhwani and &#8220;Endavedu Kondu&#8221; in Saraswathi Manohari.Melakkaveri Thiagarajan on the violin maintained a rather low profile. His Charukesi was more impressive than Kalyani. His response in swara sallies was a tad tepid. M.S. Varadan (mridangam) with Papanasam Sethuraman (ganjira) presented a crisp thani avartanam.
