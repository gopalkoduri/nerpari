VFor die-hard Ghantasala aficionados of Vijayawada, it was an evening to remember and cherish last Wednesday. The sprawling music college grounds at Satyanarayanpuram witnessed a rich fare of vintage songs rendered by Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao, in a programme held to commemorate his 35th death anniversary. Guntur-based singer Satyavani, along with debutant Shobha Kumari, T.V. Subrahmanyam and Dilip Kumar, enthralled the audience by churning out old popular songs.A couple ofashtapadisandslokascame as a pleasant surprise, turning the senior citizens nostalgic. Satyavani, with her crystal clear voice, exhibited her nuances in classical music in a splendid manner in the duets such asHayi hayi ga aamani.., Divi nundi bhuviki&#8230;, Rajasekhara neepai&#8230;, Gilli kajjalu pettukune&#8230;, Kanupapa karuvaina&#8230;, Nannu dochukunduvate&#8230;,she sang along with T.V. Subrahmanyam and Dilip Kumar.The debutant singer Shobha hardly looked like a novice as she renderedChelikadu nanne raamani piliche&#8230;andAligina velane chudalito near perfection.Along with the musical fare, the orgainsers also displayed the bronze statue of the legendary singer, sculpted at a cost of Rs. 5 lakh, which will decorate the college premises soon. Dilip Kumar, member of the organising committee said that they had honoured as many as 195 artistes both locals and from outside for their contribution to classical and film music.
