VO.S. Thyagarajan, one of the top class Carnatic vocalists of this country, was invited by the South Indian Cultural Association and arranged his concert at Ravindra Bharati, last week. Thyagarajan&#8217;s assets are an appealing voice with good vocal range. He has the art of presenting akritiwith good expression, without disturbing thesahitya bhava. He is innovative but never crossing the limits of the tradition and a hot name for m\u000aajor concerts and festivals. This Chennai-based vocalist has had tutelage under stalwart gurus O.V. Subramanyam, T.M. Thyagarajan and Lalgudi G. Jayaraman. He gave performances all over the country and abroad and has been a favourite with  AIR and Doordarshan. He is now the Dean of Fine Arts in Annamalai Unversity and Head of the Department of Music and Dance there. His concert always is sought after one and the response to his concert he gave last week for SICA was a testimony by itself. He was accompanied on this occasion, by Mysore V. Srikanth on violin and Trivendram Balaji on mridangam.Thyagarajan&#8217;s repertoire was filled with some popular and rare numbers. His approach sounded also to please the audience both with his vocal excellence and technical output, marked bymanodharma. The numbers that impressed the\u000a audience were lead byThodi, major show piece of the concert.His delineation of theragawas with restraint keeping an eye on what is beautiful.  The response on violin by Mysore Srikanth was complementary to vocalist&#8217;s effort adding to the wholesome appeal. His choice number for this <\u000aem style="i">ragawasNinne Namminanu.
