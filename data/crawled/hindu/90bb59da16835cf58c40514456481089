VPravin Godkindi presented\u000aflute recital at\u000aVeene Sheshanna Bhavana\u000aunder the auspices\u000aof Shri Rama Kala Vedike.\u000aIt was in memory of S.B.\u000aHungund, noted musician,\u000aacclaimed dramatist and a\u000atrenchant critic.The consummate flautist\u000agave ample evidence in support\u000aof popular recognition.\u000aHe dramatically demonstrated\u000ahis expertise, versatility\u000aand knowledge in\u000adovetailing the styles of\u000aboth the major schools of\u000aIndian classical music.\u000aFor a better understanding,\u000aanalyse the present concert\u000afrom two perspectives:\u000athe general form (more\u000aphysical) and the other, the\u000aexpected substance (or its\u000asubliminal content). In the\u000apresent instance, the former\u000atook precedence over the\u000alatter.Now, find how he explored\u000aHemavathi and navigated\u000athrough alaap, jod,\u000ajhaala and gat.Alaap featured sancharas,\u000anilugades and gamakas carrying\u000ashades suggestive of\u000aCarnatic style, simultaneously\u000aretaining the salient\u000afeatures of Hindustani grandeur\u000aby characteristic emphases\u000alaid on individual\u000anotes and the method of\u000aframing the phrases, reinforced\u000aby various alankars.\u000aThe Badhat entered into\u000amore and more intricacies\u000ato include the jod and jhaala\u000asections, which carried similar\u000aflashes.Further, when the percussionist\u000ajoined the lead\u000aartiste, their reciprocating\u000aand collective extempore\u000aknew no bounds in transforming\u000athe picture into a\u000aclimactic extravaganza.\u000aThe mature artistes (flautist\u000aand the percussionist),\u000aintuitively foreseeing each\u000aother's spontaneous moves,\u000acreated a world of wonders\u000awherein surging tootkaaras\u000a(tonging) and sprouting\u000alayakaris kept the audience\u000aspellbound. Changes in\u000apitches in the reverberating\u000abeats simulated the expressions\u000aof a tabala tarang.Nevertheless, the above\u000afeats worked more on a conscious\u000aplane (identifiable\u000amore with the outward appearance-\u000aobjective) where\u000amastery over the instrument\u000aand exceptional dexterity\u000awere instrumental in\u000akeeping the audience thoroughly\u000aengaged.As far as the subliminal\u000acontent (subjective) was\u000aconcerned, the concert\u000afailed to penetrate into\u000adeeper layers of the psyche,\u000awhere awaited a sense of repose\u000afor a gentle arousal and\u000aa transcending peaceful experience.\u000aIn a way, this missing\u000aelement kept haunting\u000aall the time.Other highlights were Puriyakalyan\u000a(vilambit and\u000adrut), a thumri dhun (Mishra\u000aKhamach) and a Meera\u000aBhajan.
