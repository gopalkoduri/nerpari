VIn the Obul Reddy remembrance concert Bombay Jayashri unlocked the gracious elegance of the Tyagaraja songs she chose to render &#8212; &#8216;Vandanamu Raghunandana' (Sahana), &#8216;Sujana Jeevana' (Khamas), &#8216;Bhavanuta' (Mohanam), &#8216;Bhaagaayanayya' (Chandrajyoti) and &#8216;Muripemu Galige' (Mukhari). Her style, idiom and meditativeness linked subtlety to aesthetics and voice to melody.Balanced tonality, richness of texture and the touch of tenderness &#8212; the bouquet of features &#8212; formed the reverential core value of her exposition. The concept of beauty in simplicity conferred sublimity. The quality of peace was all-pervading in the recital. These constituted the dynamic element in her musical evolution.Delicate and magnificentLike the break of dawn, Bombay Jayashri began her solemn programme with &#8216;Meluko Dayanidhi' (Sowrashtram). What gifted trait helped her to capture the timeless, angelic daintiness of &#8216;Vandanamu Raghunandana' and &#8216;Sujana Jeevana' was beyond the comprehension of the rasikas. Even delicate nuances sounded magnificent. They were rich in illumined focus. The softening of the lyrics enhanced their appeal. They responded willingly to her mind's desires.Mukhari was one raga briefly elaborated. All the delicious, cherished details were touched upon in spells of sensitive sancharas. Aesthetically artistic resources were always at hand to be summoned by her to present the raga picture in an aura of expressional felicity. The interpretation of the song was unprecedented in depth and vividness.The overall impression was that by her soulful rendering she recalled how Obul Reddy worshipped the compositions of Tyagaraja by surrendering himself to him and losing himself in the inspiration of the saint merging with eternity. The listeners, glued to their seats in silent enjoyment, would certainly have felt immortality by the environment her music created.The solemn mood of Bombay Jayashri's concert without flabby raga alapanas, chattering swaras and without the crude clapping at the end of every song &#8212; the cancer of to days performances &#8212; came as a binding revelation of what the true purpose of music is. Unfashionable as it is today to talk of music's spirituality, those who ignore the mainspring of Tyagraja's inspiration can never understand even a fraction of the saint's haunting charm. It is here that Bombay Jayshri stands apart not in any way tempted by vanity of her stature.&#8216;Ksheera Sagara Taranga Sekhara' (Sindhu Bhairavi) and &#8216;Sarvam Brahmamayam' (Darbari Kanada) of Sadasiva Brahmendra, towards the end spelt benediction. The serene atmosphere influenced the violin and mridangam accompanists &#8212; Pakala Ramadas and Manoj Siva &#8212; to lend polite, refined support.
