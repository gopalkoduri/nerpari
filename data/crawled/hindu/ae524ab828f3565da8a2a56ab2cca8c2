VYoung flautist Amit Nadig, the son of a famous flautist B. K. Anantharam was with the bubbling enthusiasm of his age, exuded youthful zest, energy and effervescence.  His concert was held in connection with the eighth anniversary and music festival held under the banner of Hamsadhwani Creations led by vocalist M. S. Sheela and her husband Ramaswamy at Seva Sadana Hall, Malleshwaram.Amit had to perform after a prolonged inaugural stage preliminaries. But he remained unperturbed in presenting a short and sweet recital. His music as it met one&#8217;s ears compelled one to ruminate over the classical and traditional values which laid increasing emphasis on the inner and outer aspects of music.And hence, the concert which took off with a fine varna in Vasantha raga brought out the profundity of the young artiste in Dwijavanthi (Akhilandeshwari), Shuddha Dhanyasi (Muthaiah Bhagavatar&#8217;s &#8220;Sri Hari Vallabhe&#8221;) and a bhajan in mishra Maand. Hopefully, he was never loud and flashy at any point of time of the recital. C.N. Chandrasekhar (violin), A.V. Anand (mridanga) and G. Omkar (ghata) imparted a resounding support.***** A senior and seasoned singer T.S. Vasantha Madhavi needs to be congratulated for successfully holding Rageshree Sammelanotsava featuring classical and music dance recitals, symposiums, workshops etc for the 16th consecutive year, under her Sri D. Subbaramaiah Fine Arts Trust. This year&#8217;s three-day festival was held at Sri Vidya auditorium of Banashankari&#8217;s &#8220;Our School&#8221;.On the second day one was moved to listen to a musical feature entitled &#8220;Rukmini Kalyana&#8221; in which there was a happy confluence of sahitya (text), raga (melody) and tala (rhythm). The tale of that great and playful Lord Krishna was the theme. Veteran vocalist Neela Ramgopal had strung different compositions culled out from various sources in difference languages together to elaborate upon the sequence of Rukmini Kalyana. The tuning of those compositions in well-thought classical ragas was another key feature of the presentation. Usha Kesari, a singer and a disciple of Neela Ramgopal was the narrator who did her job quite neatly and in a simple style.The young singer trio Dileep Simha, Dr. Sesha Prasad and Madhu Kashyap sang in unison and practiced understanding. Melodious voices, clarity of text and dignified laya merged together in delivering the import of the compositions. The trio comfortably executed the ideas of the composer of the musical feature. The theme covered the entire spectrum of Sri Krishna Leelas right from the childhood pranks to the marriage of Krishna with Rukmini (including the sequence of writing love letters, Radha-Krishna meet, sounding of the Panchajanya et al). Compositions by Purandaradasa, Subrahmanya Bharathi, Uttukkadu Venkata Kavi, Periyaalvar&#8217;s Divya Prabandhas, Meerabai, Narayana Bhattadri and Sanskrit shlokas.The charana portion &#8212; &#8220;Chaanoora malla&#8221; &#8211; the majestic Bhairavi krithi &#8220;Baala Gopala&#8221; by Muthuswamy Dikshitar was appropriately rendered.Selection and rendition of ragas like Hindola, Sindhubhairavi, Suruti, Bhairavi, Kalyani, Kambhoji, Kedara, Kapi and so on paid off rich dividends.Raghu (violin), Rajakamal (flute), Anand (mridanga), Swamy (khanjari) and Bharadwaj (morsing) lent useful support.M.
