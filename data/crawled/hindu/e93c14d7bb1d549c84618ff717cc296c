VWith scholarship in both the fields of music and Bharatanatyam, musicologist Sujatha Vijayaraghavan&#8217;s  lecture-demonstration on &#8216;Kapi in Bharatanatyam&#8217; for Narada Gana Sabha and Saraswathi Vaggeyakara Trust explored the musical scale as well as the bhava aspect of the ragam with equal authority.  Sujatha&#8217;s presentation revealed deep research and  a systematic study of the ragam.Kapi ragam&#8217;s Hindustani roots were discussed and Soumya Madanagopal, Hindustani vocalist, made a short presentation on Kafi. In the Hindustani system, Kafi is a sampoorna raga and is hence one of the 10 thaats or seven-swara modes. It is an equivalent of the 22nd melakarta Kharaharapriya in the Carnatic system.Since Kafi indicates sringara or the romantic mood, this raga or its offshoot Mishra Kafi is used in the lighter classical and folk-related compositions of thumri, tappa, hori and bhajan. Soumya demonstrated Kafi in &#8216;Chalo Hato Chodo&#8217; and Mishra Kafi in a hori &#8216;Khelatha Hai Nandalal.&#8217; In Soumya&#8217;s estimation, the Carnatic style Hindustani Kapi is a combination of Peelu and Kafi, examples of which are &#8216;Jagadodharana&#8217; and &#8216;Intha Sowkya.&#8217;Back to the Carnatic system, the discussion moved to Dikshitar&#8217;s Karnataka Kapi (Sumitra Nitin sang &#8216;Venkatachalapathe&#8217;) that is more Kanada sounding and Tygaraja&#8217;s use of the Kharaharapriya janya ragams like Sri and Kapi.The usage of Antara Gandhara and the Kakali Nishada in Kapi came in later.  Two Sringara padavarnams, &#8216;Sarasaalanu,&#8217; (Karnataka Kapi, Thanjavur Ponniah) and &#8216;Mohalaahiri&#8217; (Kapi, Kunnakudi Venkatarama Iyer), the first with emphasis on the Gandhara and the second rendered in the slower samakala, were delineated.A natural extension of romantic love is vatsalyam. This was presented in &#8216;Enna Thavam&#8217; (Papanasam Sivan) in which the kakali nishada featured. This kriti was the highlight of the morning in terms of the musical quality (Sumitra) and maturity in bhava (Guru Rhadha).According to Sujatha, Kapi lends itself to different facets of love and to different characters it portrays. One example was Kshetrayya&#8217;s &#8216;Vanne Kadu&#8217; which is full of sadness and anger at the messenger&#8217;s betrayal. A javali, &#8216;Paayaraani,&#8217; (Tirupati Vidyala Narayanaswami) captured an anxious and yearning nayika, while the lively &#8216;Sarasamulaade&#8217; (Javali, Ramanathapuram Srinivasa Iyengar) caught her playfulness. It was obvious that besides the sahitya, the manner and speed of singing can influence the flavour of a composition.Thus Kapi became the vehicle for bhakthi in Ambujam Krishna&#8217;s &#8216;Ninda Stuthi.&#8217; &#8216;Aravinda Padamalar&#8217; with hasya, veera and other rasas explored in the miracles those feet have wrought.There is no disputing that the nritta depends on the ragam, the arrangement of swaras and the speed of the composition. To illustrate the difference it can make, two tillanas were presented. One in Karnataka Kapi (Thanjavur Quartet, Adi) and the other in Kapi, chathusra jaathi Jhumpa talam by Thanjavur S. Kalyanaraman. The latter was presented and one noticed how split-second pauses were created in dance movements by the clipped manner of the composition.Sujatha concluded her scholarly and in-depth two and a half hour presentation with a verse in Kapi from &#8216;Kurai Ondrum Illai&#8217; that was a joyful finale. She also had a point of view on the old and the new versions of Kapi. Should we not call this new avatar Nava Kapi, she asked. The singers were: Sujatha, Jhanani, Sumitra. Nattuvangam was alternately by Guru Rhadha, Sumitra and Sunanda Narayanan.The orchestra members were Sigamani (violin) and Dhananjayan (mridangam). The dancers were: Guru Rhadha, Sumitra, Tara Raman and Pranathi. Dance choreography was by Guru Rhadha.
