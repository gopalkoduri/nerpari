VBlessed with a husky voice, K.P. Nandini's vocal concert was marked by her thoughtful and restrained presentation. There was no hurried articulation but at the same time, no wilting passages; the concert moved at the right pace and was replete with impressive kritis.The first raga alapana Sriranjani came after nearly four numbers. Starting from the lower region sancharas, Nandini developed the raga smartly, integrating long melodious phrases with swift akaras thus maintaining an even tempo. The raga essay also showed Nandini's penchant to showcase the richness of the raga without any compromise or over indulgence. Tyagaraja's &#8216;Brochevarevare' kept the mood and momentum alive; the swarakalpana was precisely conceived and smartly framed.Good choicePantuvarali carries an intrinsic vibrancy, which was fully exploited by Nandini in her raga exposition. &#8216;Enna Ganu Rama Bhajana' of Bhadrachala Ramadas was, indeed, a good choice. &#8216;Sannutinchu Sri Rama', the anupallavi line, was taken up for detailed niraval and swaras. The exercise went on well with the kuraippu swara strings towards the end centering on shadjam.Nandini's raga and swara essays showed her maturity in approach and clarity in delivery. Nevertheless, it will augur well for her growth as a successful vocalist if she pays more attention to the lyrical aspect of the kritis and a bit of calculation on her ability to set free flowing swaras especially while fixing the finale. These are definitely minor issues and in fact, imperceptible, but it would be better for her to take care of them even now.The programme opened with &#8216;Gananathane' in Saranga by Periaswami Thooran and &#8216;Dayapayonidhe' in Jaganmohini (Meesu Krishna Iyer) and concluded with the delicate but poignant Sivaranjani tillana of Lalgudi Jayaraman. The other kritis performed were &#8216;Sangeetha Gnanamu' in Dhanyasi, &#8216;Vandanamu' in Sahana both by Tyagaraja, &#8216;Endraikku Sivakrupai' in Mukhari by Neelakanta Sivan, &#8216;O Jagadamba' in Anandabhairavi by Syama Sastri and &#8216;Muruganai Bhajimaname' in Jhonpuri by Papanasam Sivan.Since the programme at Raga Sudha hall was under the banner of Youth Association of Classical Music, it was a youth parade. Violinist G. Badrinath enjoyed equal opportunity and time for raga exposes and swara segments. He acquitted himself well with commendable ease and confidence.K.H. Vineeth on the percussion provided soft and subtle support to Nandini. His tani avartanam was expressive of his youthful energy.
