VSalem Gayathri VenkatesanCD - Rs. 75.Kalavardhani has brought out a CD of Salem Gayathri Venkatesan's vocal concert. The concert commences with the ever bright `Varanamukha' (Hamsadhwani-Rupakam-Koteewara Iyer) followed by brief kalpanaswaras. `Smara Janaka Subha' (Behag-Mishram- Swathi Tirunal) that follows finds Gayathri going very nasal in the pallavi improvisation as she traverses the upper octave. The sangatis appear too concocted. Her Panthuvarali alapana passes muster while Akkarai Swarnalatha's (violin) reply is competent.`Sundartharadeham' (Adi- Tyagaraja) with niraval and swaras in Agama Sancharam is on expected lines but `Raga Sudhrasa' (Andolika-Adi-Tyagaraja) is a lacklustre effort. However, Gayathri makes up for all this in her well structured alapana of Sankarabharanam. `Akshyalinga Vibho' (Mishram-Dikshitar) rendered at an appropriate pace is satisfying. Special mention must be made of Gayathri's pronunciation. Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar (mridangam) and Adambakkam Shankar (ghatam) combine well to add pep to the proceedings, particularly in the thani.
