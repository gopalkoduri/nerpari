VR. Swaminadhan's violin solo was an opportunity for raiskas in Palakkad to listen to the sound of the &#8216;Paroor school.' Swaminadhan, a faculty member of the Chembai Memorial Music College, is a student of the violin maestro M.S. Anantharaman, son of the legendary Paroor Sundareswarayyar, founder of the distinctive Paroor style.Swaminadhan played pieces that were adorned with symmetry and refined bowing techniques. He was accompanied by the talented Palakkad Mahesh Kumar on the mridangam and E.M.Dipu on the ghatom.The violinist opened the concert with a lively Ata tala varnam &#8216;Neranammithi' in raga Kanada; a piece composed by Ramanathapuram Sreenivasayyankar. A lilting &#8216;Nee vatanegana' of Tyagaraja, set to Khandhachappu tala, was appended with crisp swara prasthara. It was followed by the Swati Tirunal composition &#8216;Devadeva' in Mayamalavagoula, Roopaka tala.Exquisite Kunthavarali&#8216;Bhogeenthrasayinam,' another Swati kriti, set to Khandhachapputhala, following an exquisite rendition of Kunthalavarali, led to the high point of the concert &#8211; an eloquent portrayal of Thodi. Flashes of sancharas illuminated the facets of the raga. While the alapana fulfilled the technical and aesthetic parameters, the violinist ensured that serenity reigned supreme.
