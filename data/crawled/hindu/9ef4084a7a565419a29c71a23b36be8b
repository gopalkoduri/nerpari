VThe mathematical beauty of Carnatic music was revealed at the very outset in a vocal concert of the versatile Trivandrum Krishnakumar. &#8216;Evaribodhana' in Abhogi raga, Adi tala, a varnam composed by Patnam Subrahmaniayyar, was sung in two speeds. While singing the charana swaras, Krishnakumar demonstrated &#8216;gruhabhedam' by shifting the &#8216;adharashadja' of the pentatonic Abhogi, to Madhyama and deriving raga Valachi, thereby clearly differentiating the characteristics of both ragas.Krishnakumar's concert was marked by clear diction and articulation. Thiruvananthapuram Sampath (violin), Vadakara Anilkumar (mridangam) and Vazhappalli Krishnakumar (ghatam) provided adequate support.Grace and eleganceSalutation to Lord Ganesa came in the form of &#8216;Gananadhane Gunabodhane' (raga Saranga, Adi tala), a composition of Periyaswamithooran in Tamil, which was embellished with swarakalpana. &#8216;Sreeneelolpalanayike,' one of the group compositions &#8216;Neelolpalamba navavarana' of Muthuswami Dikshitar in Sanskrit (Narireetigowla, Roopaka tala), was sung in a slow pace, which showcased the grace and elegance of the composition.Another choukkakala kriti &#8216;Nee dayarada Amba,' composed by Krishnakumar's guru M. Balamuralikrishna and set to Adi tala, which followed a skillful Poorvikalyani, was adorned with niraval and cascading Manodharma swara passages at &#8216;Kalamellaneekai&#8230;' The only brisk number Krishnakumar sang was &#8216;Marukelara' of Tyagaraja in Jayanthasree.An enchanting elaboration of Kedaragowla filled with karuna bhakthi bhava, was reminiscent of his guru. Krishnakumar's rendition of the Tyagaraja krithi &#8216;Thulaseebilwa,' set to Adi tala (two kala), brought out the structural aesthetics and sahithya bhava of the composition. Spirited niraval at &#8216;Karunatho&#8230;' and an impeccable manodharmaswara sequence, was followed by an opulent tani.&#8216;Ennapizhai cheithano' of Koteeswarayyar in Rasikapriya, &#8216;Kanthrpajanaka' of Annamachrya, &#8216;Etheeruhananu' of Bhadrachala Ramadas and &#8216; Jagadodhrana' of Purandaradasa were dipped in devotional fervour . Krishnakumar wound up the concert with a Thillana in Behag and the mangalam &#8216;Sreenivasaya' due to shortage of time. The concert was organised by the Palghat Fine Arts Society.
