VSmitha Shrikiran presented a flute recital at Vasudevacharya Bhavana in Mysore on the occasion of releasing her CD, &#8220;Divine Vibes&#8221;. Trained under the able guidance of Guru A.V. Prakash, (trained in the lineage of the legendary T.R. Mahalingam), Smitha has inherited their mesmerising naada characteristic. Her approach is gentle, devoid of flashy movements.The selection of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Paramathmudu&#8221; (Vagadhishwari) as the focus, and the method of its rendition pointed to the artiste&#8217;s strong spiritual inclination. In a detailed alapana she took care to see that the duration of shadshrithi rishaba was sufficiently stretched and appropriate gamakas imaginatively incorporated, freeing this vivadimela of its inherent shortcoming (dosha).She upheld the karunarasa the raga carried and the gravity of the message the composer has imprinted in the lyrics. Even the swarakalpana complemented the general mood, further enhanced by Dhayakar on the violin.A brief, crisp and melodic thani avarthana by H.L. Shivashankaraswamy (mridanga) and Ananthakrishna Sharma (ghata) spoke of the percussionists&#8217; discretion in maintaining the meditative ambience created. Other highlights were GNB&#8217;s &#8220;Saraswathi Namosthuthe&#8221; (Saraswathi), Swathi Thirunal&#8217;s &#8220;Bhogindrashayinam&#8221; (Kunthalavarali), and Purandaradasa&#8217;s &#8220;Pillangoviya&#8221; (Mohan).***Neurologist Dr. M.S. Bhaskar gave a Hindustani concert under the auspices of Swarasankula Sangeetha Sabha. Balance and proportion framed the developments. A definite predominance of mood- oriented badhat made the difference.In &#8220;Khovan Laagi&#8221; (Puryakalyan), the elaboration derived all its charm from a methodical approach, in which lyrics thrived on appropriate behlavas and sancharas traversing the whole terrain of the raag. Due importance was given to the purvang and the uttarang, and also a judicious emphasis on komal rishabh, pancham and shudha dhaivath, admirably preserved the individuality of Puryakalyan. Elaborations at &#8220;Abtho Yaadh (Dhyaan) Karo Naam Hariko&#8221; were one of the significant moments where his total involvement enlivened the cheez. Taking cues from the nature of the construction of the bandhish, he imaginatively expanded the taans. Patterns, magnitudes and the depths of the articulations and inflections harmonised with the general mood, and the number shone as a composite musical whole.Though the singer preferred the middle and the lower octaves to unravel his extempore, it did not in any way restrict either his expressions or the personality of the raag.&#8220;Pratham Sur Sadhe&#8221; (Rageshri) stood for unflinching dedication and humble commitment &#8212; prerequisites of any learning process, in which the divine presence of the teacher is indispensable. The tune and the tenor lulled the mind.&#8220;Naneke Badavanayya&#8221; (Desh), &#8220;Govinda Ninna Ananda&#8221; (Kiravani- both of Purandaradasa) and &#8220;Matha Saraswathi&#8221; (Bhairavi) were other equally interesting numbers.The art of accompanying the lead artiste is by itself a specialisation, not something to be taken for granted, and in this respect Veerabhadraiah Hiremath&#8217;s harmonium &#8216;sang&#8217; with the vocalist and Bhimashankar Bidanur&#8217;s tabla resonated with the peaceful experience.
