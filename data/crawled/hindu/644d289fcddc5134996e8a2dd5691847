VIn every aspect, the Musiri Chamber Concert was appealing; as one entered the polygon shaped hall of the music maestro's ancestral home, the delicate fragrance of agarbati greeted rasikas. There was no stage or huge loudspeakers -- only two small speakers placed at vantage points. A cup of hot coffee was served to all those present. The hall was aesthetically illuminated with soft incandescent lights, and some really catchy black and white line drawings of the Trinity decorated the wall behind the performers seated on the floor. It was not a crowded gathering; just fifteen to twenty rasikas.When an artist approaches music with humility and reverence, it definitely shows in the presentation. Ch. Mahalakshmi possesses a dulcet voice with considerable reach and good training, and her vocal recital was reflective of her respect for the classical idiom. The Nattakuranji varnam, &#8216;Chalamela,' was presented with swara and sahitya packages. Mahalakshmi quickly moved to raga expansion after the Atana kriti &#8216;Sri Mahaganapatim' of Mysore Jayachamaraja Wodeyar.Accent on phrasesMayamalavagowla, Hamsanadam and Dhanyasi were offered with great assiduousness and commitment. Mahalakshmi's focus was on the phrases of the raga and she preferred to integrate quickset akaras to embellish them. Melody and emotion were never sacrificed at any juncture.Simplicity and straight forwardness many times could be rewarding, as was seen in Mahalakshmi's effort. Mayamalavagowla and Dhanyasi showed enough maturity and Hamsanadam had peripheral charm rather than core content.Tyagaraja's &#8216;Vidulagu' in Mayamalavagowla and the brief niraval and swaras with panchamam as the central note were impressively linked to the line, &#8216;Kamala Gowri.'Annamacharya's &#8216;Telisithe Mokshamu' in Hamsanadam with a few strings of swaras made for a sincere offering. Tyagaraja's &#8216;Dyaname Vara' in Dhanyasi was relaxed sans niraval and swara appendages.Mahalakshmi was parsimonious with the swaras and so there were no long drawn meanders with them. A little more stress on the clear enunciation of the lyrics will add merit to Mahalakshmi's credentials. Shertalai Sivakumar on the violin shared excellent partnership with the singer and his raga delineations and swarakalpanas were loaded with melody and harmony.Melakkaveri Balaji on the mridangam was in perfect sync with the proceedings and his tani avartanam came in the initial stages itself after &#8216;Vidulagu'.
