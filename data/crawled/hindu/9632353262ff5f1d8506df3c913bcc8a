VIn keeping with the kutcheri tradition, he began with the majestic Ata tala varnam, &#8216;Sarasija Naabha&#8217; in Khambodi. &#8216;Gajavadana Maampaahi&#8217; by M.D.Ramanathan in Hamsadhwani followed impressively with intricate swara patterns. Immediately after the sprightly torrential swaras for &#8216;Saaramegaani Anya Maarga,&#8217; the Tyagaraja kriti in Panthuvarali, Srinivasan rendered &#8216;Kaamakshi&#8217; (Syama Sastri&#8217;s swarajathi in Bhairavi) with quiet dignity, filling the heart with blissful peace.He also sang &#8216;Narayana Ninna Naamava&#8217; in Suddha Dhanyasi (Purandaradasa) and &#8216;Dayaraani.. Dayaraani&#8217; in Mohanam (Tyagaraja), his father&#8217;s favourite kritis. &#8216;Naaga Gaandhaari Raaganuthe&#8217; and &#8216;Raghuvamsa Sudhaambudhi Chandra&#8217; lifted the spirits with their fast pace. &#8216;Senthilaandavan&#8217; by Papanasam Sivan (Kharaharapriya) was presented as the main piece at an unhurried pace. If there was the rarely heard &#8216;Saarasa Sama Mukha&#8217; in Khamas by Swati Tirunal, there were also the popular delightful songs &#8216;Neeraja Dhala Nayanaa,&#8217; &#8216;Thungaa There Viraajam,&#8217; &#8216;Raagathil Sirandha Raagam Edhu&#8217; and &#8216;Bho Shambho.&#8217; Srinivasan concluded his concert with a thillana on the Kanchi Paramacharya  composed by Maharajapuram Santhanam.His son Ganesh Viswanathan exhibited remarkable improvement in the raga delineation and swaraprastharas. But when his father took over, the difference was very obvious as Srinivasan scored over him with his lively imagination and enviable energy. He surely has embellished the hereditary gift with untiring industry.M.A.Sundaresan enhanced the effect of the concert with honeyed phrases on his violin. The glistening swaras leapt through his nimble fingers as his bow coaxed them into shape. Thanjavur Kumar on the mridangam and Alathur Rajaganesh on the ganjira  formed an excellent team along with Ganesh Srinivasan&#8217;s konnakkol (vocal percussion) and made the thani avarthanam sparkle.
