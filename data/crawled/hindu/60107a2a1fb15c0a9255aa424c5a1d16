VDo grace and tension co-exist? No, at least not in music. Recently Arati Ankalikar Tikekar, a deserving vocalist of the Jaipur gharana, performed an enjoyable classical recital in Varanasi. She sang two modern ragas Madhuwanti and Hemant in her own confident style, keeping the aesthetics of Jaipur aside.The drut of both ragas suited her nature, and made a good impact on the listeners, the vilambit (slow tempo) of Madhuwanti in Jhap tala brimmed with effort.Is the nature of this raga in contrast with the singer&#8217;s  nature? &#8220;No,&#8221; she answers, but admits, &#8220;The mood of an artiste matters. Being a professional vocalist, I ought to disregard this aspect, but it was there.&#8221;Organised by Kala Prakash, this recital went through a range of mixed emotions, in the Pandit Omkar Nath Thakur Hall of Banaras Hindu University. Madhuwanti is a new raga cultivated from raga Multani by making its two notes Re and Dha pure (Shuddha). In this recital, the note tivra Madhyam and the vadi note Pancham sounded harsh, losing the beauty and grace of the Jaipur gharana. Komal Gandhar was also not meticulously soft. Arati has cultivated her musical skills in the golden shadow of Kishori Amonkar, stalwart of the Jaipur gharana but now she is taking lessons from Dinesh Kaikini of the Agra gharana. As we know, the Jaipur school is known for its aesthetics and Ustad Alladia Khan Saheb. &#8220;I doubt that Kishori Tai sings Jaipur gharana,&#8221; she adds, &#8220;Gharanas are simply attitudes to perceive the same raga through different angles. I don&#8217;t quite follow any gharana now. Swara, shabda and laya should be there, sadhana should be there and a beautiful heart should be there, which was absent that evening I admit, but not fully.&#8221;She sang the chhota khayals of raga Madhuwanti and Hemant impeccably.  &#8220;I choose a raga on my own first and then try to convey its essence and essential nature in terms of musical energy and accurate notes. Sometimes one fails, as you knowraga,rasoi aur pagdi kabhi kabhi hi achhi banti hai. Therefore, the alap portion of a raga matters to me more than the attributes of alamkaras,&#8221; Arati asserts.Finally, she presented her most popular Meerabai bhajan, &#8220;Mhare Ghar Aana ji&#8221; with patterned improvisation. It brought to mind the devotional bhajan sung by Kishori Amonkar &#8220;Mharo Pranam&#8221; that became much more popular in the 60&#8217;s.The next day Arati presented two remarkable lectures-cum-demonstrations at the Departments of Musicology and Mass Communications.  Recently she also received a National Film Award for best playback singer.&#8220;I am going to have different experiences in other art disciplines. I would like to create a new paradigm of classical music in terms of post modern fusion and that is natural to me,&#8221; she concludes.
