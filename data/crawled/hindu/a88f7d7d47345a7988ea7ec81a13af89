VThe vibrancy of Youth Association of Classical Music (YACM) was visible in their anniversary celebrations scheduled at the Raga Sudha hall showcasing the young talents in special concerts and other interactive programmes listed.The Veena-Venu-Violin combo of R. Sriram, J.B. Sruthi Sagar and M. Rajiv with A.V. Manikandan and H. Prasanna on percussion turned out to be one such event.Understandably, it is a trying exercise to create a musical revue blending the wind and string instruments without sacrificing their characters and quality and at acceptable decibels.The commendable quality of this trio&#8217;s concert was the perfect rapport shared by the players. The kritis went in succession at no point suffered from any confusion of overlapping sangatis or jarring isolated notes. Bhairavi Ata tala varnam and Hamsadhwani composition (&#8216;Vandeham Jagat&#8217;) made a good start. Unique ragas and kritis like &#8220;Padavini sadbhaktiyu&#8221; in Salagabhairavi and &#8220;Mayamma&#8221; in Ahiri at fast and medium pace maintained the gait.The raga alapana of Kanada shared by the three artists was  rather lukewarm. The sharp karvais of Sruthi Sagar and a couple of catchy phrases by Rajiv had to compensate the tepid passage of Sriram. The swara circles for the composition &#8220;Mamavasatha janani&#8217; also moved on a similar vein without much energy though the song came with verve. The concert picked up force after the sparkling &#8220;Nenarunchi nanu&#8221; in Malavi and gravitated to the main raga Kalyani.The exposition of the raga was spread out among Sriram, Rajiv and Sagar. Sriram&#8217;s control on veena came to fore when he played a highly evocative and colourful thanam in the traditional genre bringing the melody and versatility of the instrument. The combined raga vinyasa carried more of melodious face of Kalyani than its majesty. &#8220;Ethavunara&#8221; with its innumerable permutations of sangatis in enjoyable unison culminated into the extensive niraval and swara at &#8220;Sri Garudaku Tyagaraja.&#8221; The niraval segment with swara sallies exchanged on nishadam as the landing note flowed with freshness and fertility in imagination of the young artists marching towards a well-rehearsed and neatly aligned finale.Shortcomings? Yes; the major being the total lack of balancing of instrument specific audio levels. The bamboo was dominant all through almost effacing the two string instruments. Sruthi Sagar had, therefore, enjoyed an edge over the other two and it looked as if they were playing second fiddle to the flautist. It is no belittling the talents of Rajiv and Sriram but a better planning and audio control would have definitely showcased all the three artists on equal footing.In a similar manner, Manikandan on the mridangam  overpowered Prasanna on the ghatam; again blame it on the audio.The rhythmic padding was no doubt absolute but would have been more enjoyable with softer touches.  The tani avartanam went the same way.
