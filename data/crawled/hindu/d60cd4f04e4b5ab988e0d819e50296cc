Then, he sangEvaraniin Devamrithavarshini andAnnapoornaof Dikshitar (Sama) next he extensively dealt uponSarasijanabha Murareof Swathi Tirunal (Todi).Sriram proved his mettle by his expression of manodharma in the form of ragaalapana, neravu and swarakalpana. After singingBantureethi(Hamsanadam), he came out with yet another exercise, Mohana ragam, thanam and pallavi set in Aaditalam.
