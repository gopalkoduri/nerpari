VThe staid images of raga alapanas and rendering of kirtanas in the concert of the violin duet by Vasanta Kannan and Kolkata Srividya in the Gokulashtami series of Sri Krishnagana Sabha failed to make their presentation impressive. Success of a concer\u000at calls for more than competence.Special techniques to catch the fancy of listeners within the frontiers of classicism serve to cater to rasika expectations. Exhilaration of raga bhava and the rave gift of spontaneous suggestiveness are the ingredients that rivet the attention of listeners.While the quality of the duo&#8217;s play was noteworthy, the effort did not reveal sufficient musical fervour, though it adhered strictly to kutcheri propriety. Their technique was marked by symmetrically arranged sancharas in alapanas and interpretation of kirtanas.  The recital sailed on the strength of a good list of kirtanas. &#8216;Raghu Nayaka&#8217; (Hamsadhwani) and &#8216;Ra Ra Maa Intidaaga&#8217; (Asaveri) gave a sedate beginning. Tyagaraja&#8217;s songs at the beginning are really the saving grace in the hands of any musician. They automatically attune the minds to real values.The first raga alapana was from Srividya. Raga Begada, at her hands, was well expressed and the kirtana, &#8216;Sankari Neeve&#8217; was rendered with dignity within the artistic limits. The more elaborate vinyasa of Thodi was by Vasanta Kannan. Step by step build-up on traditional lines formed the fabric of the raga. There was lucidity in the sancharas, simple in approach and restrained in picturisation. In the song, &#8216;Sri Krishnam Bhaja Manasa&#8217; and the  kirtana &#8216;Akhilandeswari&#8217; there was a spark of reverence.The mridangam artist, Kolkata Mohan, another family member was more interested in laying bare his rhythmic ideas than to graft his play to the format of the kirtanas. It was okay in his thani with the ghatam player S. Venkataramanan.
