VEnjoyment of music does not arise from a technique-based raga frame or kirtana rendering. It springs from how a vidwan imparts intuitively sensitive touch of soothing quality. Violin solo recitals of good standard ensure thisanubhavabecause its decibel level, unlike that of vocalists, is ear-friendly.  R.K. Shriramkumar provided such a concert under the auspices of Nada Inbam.When stringed melody and the Trinity kritis blended, &#8216;O! Jagadamba&#8217; (Ananda Bhairavi) &#8216;Kaaru Baaru&#8217; (Mukhari) and &#8216;Sri Subramanyaya Namaste&#8217; (Khambhodi), the impact was irresistible. Shriramkumar&#8217;s raga vinyasa of Ananda Bhairavi and Khambhodi and his handling of the songs looked as if he was gauging how severely the exposition was progressing. The playing standard of the kirtanas was appropriate to their grandeur.Shriramkumar&#8217;s watchful absorption of a great violin maestro&#8217;s performances &#8212; which he never fails to attend &#8212; found reflection in his music&#8217;s basis. If the rakti-filled raga images were classy, the kirtanas got a melodic revamp. Listening to him over the years, both as an accompanist and recently as a soloist, there was every indication of his enhanced understanding of sangita&#8217;s soulfulness.The flow of sleek, polished presentation of Ananda Bhairavi found its way to solid movement punctuated with karvais and curves making listening experience engaging. The first two or three sancharas opened up an arc of the raga&#8217;s deliciousness.With manodharma and expression in harmonious precision Shriramkumar&#8217;s edifice of Khambhodi was remarkable for sprightly elegance with which it reached classical heights. Resplendent flashes and versatility in spreading a gorgeous canvas of aesthetic lyricism formed his inspirational journey in the tara sthayi.Gripping sancharas competed for attention and the rasikas silently absorbed the stunning landscape of Khambhodi.Shriramkumar fathomed the depth of the kirtanas, &#8216;Kaaru Baaru&#8217; and &#8216;Sri Subramanyaya Namaste,&#8217; his interpretative vision looking beyond merely the structure of the songs. There was organic discipline and emphasis in bringing out the aesthetic niches. He captured the ecstasy of Rama Rajya portrayed by Tyagaraja in the Mukhari piece and the sampradaya sangatis in the Dikshitar&#8217;s Khambhodi magnificence. The Kapinarayani song &#8216;Sarasa Sama Dana&#8217; was to whet the appetite of rasikas. Refinement as the corner stone of his aspiration, the concert focussed not only on his talent to touch brilliance but also the capacity to sustain it.Manoj Siva&#8217;s percussive support was quiet, correct and thoughtful. His teka caresses were exceptionally soft revealing his intimacy with the gentle aspects of Shriramkumar&#8217;s style. His thani, however, was provocative.
