VChilling at The Park listening to the fusion of a sarangi by Sabir Khan and Beatboxing Aussie sensation Benjamin Standford a.k.a. Dub Fx, was like standing in sharp spiking rain with lightning to boot!The volley of songs &#8211; including nursery rhymes like Hickory Dickory, the fusion ignited the mood of the young (old too, though few) who started foot-tapping on an impulse and powered more response as the songs progressed. Spurred by the impetus from Benjamin and Sebastian, whose timbre was electrifying, especially with the numbers I woke up in the morning and Run, run as fast as you can the enthusiastic audience were on a high.Egged on by instant gratification of the audience, Dub Fx came out with some unique music that may sound a wee bit outlandish to the prude conventionalist mind, but it had a reach that could kindle musical interest even in the masses. Simple lyrics, wonderful music and an awesome presentation-what more can one ask for? He came armed with a set of foot pedals, used to create sound effects, like reverb, high pitch-low pitch, bass sounds and the like. Coupled with vocals, he generated some funky tunes. With his fianc&#233; and fellow dub-stepper, Flower Fairy, he straddles various musical genres by simply stepping on the pedals from time to time, complimenting it with his beatboxing.Sabir Khan, at the sarangi tuned in perfect. It was an ethno-fusion at its best what with the wizard weaving magical spells like a sharp-shooter in keeping with the tempo of the beatboxer. Sound and music mixed like a multi-lingual mother tongue that is the rightful product of a globalised music realm. The seamless merger wiped out the earlier demarcations of music vesting it a new dimension and meaning branding it as the present day's passion to reach out to the world at large.
