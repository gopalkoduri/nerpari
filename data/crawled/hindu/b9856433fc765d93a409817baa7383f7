VSeasoned vocalist V.R. Dileepkumar's chaste concert mesmerised Carnatic music buffs in Palakkad, recently.Endowed with a pliable voice, Dileep's creative style, which is devoid of unnecessary brigas and frills, strictly adhered to tradition. His bhava-laden treatment of ragas, and the manner in which he appended interesting manodharmaswaras with arithmetic precision to each composition, were praiseworthy.The vocalist established his command over his craft in the opening Adi tala varnam &#8216;Inthamodi' (Saranga) itself, which was sung in medium tempo, with admirable support from T.H. Subramanian (violin), Gurvayoor Sanoj (mridangam) and Vellattanjore Sreejith (ghatam). From Tyagaraja's &#8216;Nannubrovani' (Abhogi) to Swati Tirunal's kriti &#8216;Vande sada Padmanabham' (Navarasakannada), throughout the concert Dileep maintained the appropriate kalapramana.A poignant ragaalapana of Sama, rich in devotional fervour, showcased the musical perception of the vocalist. His nourishment of &#8216;Santhamuleka,' the Tyagaraja kriti in Vilambakala, which he soaked in devotion, evoked serenity.Erudite elaborationSyama Sastri's &#8216;Ninnuvinamarigalada' in Reethigowla and a brisk &#8216;Kanjadalayathakshi' by Muthuswami Dikshitar (Kamalamanohari) were apt preludes to an erudite elaboration of Poorvikalyani. He went on to expound the innate beauty of the raga in systematic developments, with subtle gamakas and apt repose. Subramanian complemented the rendition by melodiously responding to the improvisational passages. Syama Sastri's &#8216;Ninnuvinagamari' set to Misrachappu tala, embellished with a well-articulated lyrical sequence at &#8216;Paramalopulalu&#8230;' and brilliant cascading strings of swara, showcased Dileep's mastery over classicism. The tani matched the quality of the vocal rendition.The latter half of the concert saw devotional numbers such as Purandaradasa's &#8216;Idu bhagya' (Vridavanasaraga) and &#8216;Baro Krishnayya,' and wound up with a lilting javali &#8211; &#8216;Chelinenethu' in Paras &#8211; and a mangalam thereafter. The concert was organised by the Palghat Fine Arts Society.
