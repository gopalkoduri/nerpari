On this occasion, Bharata Bharati felicitated veteran journalist and art critic Chaganti Kalpaleswara Rao by presenting him with a Swarna Kankanam, a shawl and a garland.On the occasion many celebrities among musicians and dancers were also felicitated. Siva Prasad designed this concert in a different way. He made raga Mohana as the main vehicle and chose some popular compositions in it and presented them with utmost care.Some of them areVilambakala kirtanasthat suit his style of presentation. And yet he ventured inSwarakalpanaand the last piece inRagam TanamandPallavi, to go for higher speed presentation. One aspect that marked his whistling was the perfect sound, sans any hiss that generally accompanies a whistle sound.He also arranged for himself a good orchestral support with leading names taking part as accompanists. They included violinists Peri Sriramamurthy and Ramanamurthy, mridangam artiste D.S.R. Murthy, Ramanamurthy on ghatam and Kapa Srinivasa Rao on morsing.
