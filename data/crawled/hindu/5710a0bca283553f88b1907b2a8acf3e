VKrithis of Swati TirunalTrichur V. RamachandranNadham Music Media.MRP Rs 125.Semmangudi Sinivasa Iyer and G.N.Balasubramanian, who had both served as principals in the Swati Tirunal Music College at Thiruvananthapuram, were frequent singers of the compositions of the Maharajah in their concerts. The current popularity of these songs is to a great extent due to the efforts of these legends.Trichur V. Ramachandran, from the GNB lineage, is gifted with a robust voice akin to his guru's and has been a consistently good performer with a sincere approach to music.Faithfully upholding his mentor's unique bhani, Ramachandran has sung seven compositions of Swati Tirunal in the recently released audio compact disc brought out by Nadham Music Media. The accompanists M.A. Sundareswaran (violin ), J. Skandaprasad (mridangam ) and Vaikom Gopalakrishnan (ghatam) have accompanied with gusto and contribute enthusiastically. Ramachandran commences with the K. Ata tala varnam &#8220;Sarasijanabha,&#8221; which is rendered in two speeds. This varnam is also attributed by some to be composition of Thanjavur Vadivelu. A brisk start is provided to the proceedings with this varnam and is sung with a good grip.&#8220;Pahisreepathe&#8221; (Hamsadwani ) is a good choice and is a refreshing number. The oft-heard kriti on Devi &#8220;Mamava Sada Janani&#8221; (Kanada-Rupakam) follows paving the way for a spirited vinyasa of Pantuvarali. The vocalist and the violinist offer the raga in their respective styles which is thoroughly engaging. The technical ornamentation by way of niraval and kalpana swaras for the kriti &#8220;Paripalaya&#8221; is at the sahitya portion &#8220;Kamalarasana&#8221; as against the frequently taken up &#8220;Sri Padmanabha&#8221; by many.Raga grammar&#8220;Paripalayamam&#8221;( Reetigowlai-Rupakam) and &#8220;Parama Purusham&#8221; (Lalita Panchamam-K.Chapu ) are involved renderings. Ramachandran is careful with the grammar of raga Reetigowla and wisely chooses to commence the charanam of the song &#8220;Thamarasa&#8221; at nishadam in the madhya stayi.The bhava laden alapana of Charukesi is done with sheen. &#8220;Krupayapalaya&#8221; (M. chapu ) has a good patantharam with a brief solfa swara bout at &#8220;Narada Muka Muni.&#8221; The percussionists have done their role admirably.The mistakes which appear in the inlay card of the disc are a bit too many. The tala for the varnam reads as Khandachapu and the raga Lalitha Panchamam reads as 'Lalitha Panchangam to mention a few.
