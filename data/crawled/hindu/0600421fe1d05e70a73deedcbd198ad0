VAfter the recital of Panacharatna kritis, veteran musician N.P. Ramaswamy presented choicest compositions of the composer. He won the audience with emotive renditions of &#8216;Rama nine nammi nanu&#8217; in Huseni and &#8216;Lavanya Rama&#8217; in Poornashadjam. His elaboration of Kalyani was kept to the essential phrases owing to time constraints. &#8216;Amma Ravamma&#8217; in Khanda chappu was packed with swaras, offering a wide  variety within the full scale of the raga.The concert by Bombay Jayashri in the evening had B.U. Ganesh Prasad on the violin and Njanjil Arun on the mridangam. The vocalist displayed an inclination for &#8216;raciness&#8217; even though her creativity  remained unblemished. As always,  her &#8216;shruti shudha&#8217; music struck a chord with therasikas.The barest phrases of Begada led to &#8216;Vallabha nayakasya,&#8217; which was the opening piece. The fast rendition of the Darbar kriti &#8216;Mundu venuke&#8217; raised many a discerning eyebrow. Arun on the mridangam filled the gaps and sangatis effectively. A short depiction  of Bowli raga was followed by  &#8216;Karunanidhiye,&#8217; in which she filled the short gaps with jarus and fast sangatis.Repetitions were often noticed in the vocalist&#8217;s detailing of Kanada raga for &#8216;Sri Narada.&#8217; The rich timbre of Ganesh Prasad&#8217;s violin added sheen to the  raga. &#8216;Pavanutha Narada&#8217; was caught up with a poignant &#8216;Chitham irangadenayya&#8217; in Sahana raga and mishra chappu tala. Brigas, usually not used much by Jayashri, was found in her Kalyani alaapana. A brisk rendition of &#8216;Himadri suthe,&#8217; a composition of Shyama Shastri in Roopaka tala, had swaras in the second speed.The Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Sarasasamadana bheda danda&#8217; in Kapinarayani raga was tagged on to the main elaboration of Todi. Minute, fast sangatis that were sung gave a  detailed picture  of the raga. The neraval for the charanam in &#8216;Kaddanuvariki&#8217; was splendid for its leisurely treatment.The taniyavarthanam was well planned and short. Gopinatha Prabhu did a good job on the ghatom.  Two Hindustani bhajans &#8216;Gopala gokul vallabheepriya&#8217; and &#8216;Aaye giridhar dware&#8217; in Puriya Dhanashri were appreciated by the  audience.  As these songs have been popularised by the singer in her albums, the instrumentalists seemed to know every twist and turn in the sangatis.The programme  was organised by Sankara Educational institutionas and Kerala Fine Arts society.
