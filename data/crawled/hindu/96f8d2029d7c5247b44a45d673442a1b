VRight from the Nattakurinji varnam, the well-planned concert of violin exponent Kanyakumari in the company of disciple Sanjeev, at the Music Club, IIT, Madras, provided a wholesome experience.  &#8216;Sri Mahaganapathi&#8217; (Gowlai-Dikshitar) prefa\u000aced Dikshitar&#8217;s Chathurdasa Ragamalika (14 ragas). One wondered why jatiswaram was omitted in the former. &#8216;Dharini Telusukonti&#8217; (Suddhasaveri, Tyagaraja), which is full of sangati is ideal for the violin.Kanyakumari&#8217;s alapana had each prayoga in its burnished form indicating that this artiste has won her spurs deservedly through her long immersion in music.The niraval and swarakorvais brought out the sensitivity of the strings on the violin. The instrument with the pick-up mike made vivid the lower octaves and at times one was able to visualise and hear &#8220;the voice&#8221; of a seasoned vocalist.A bold and powerful innovator that she is, Kanyakumari then posed a teaser by essaying Madhyamaravali (&#8216;Narayanaya Namo Raghavayya&#8217; -Narayana Tirtha, tuned by T.M.Thiagarajan) demonstrating the razor thin line between this raga and Karnaranjani. Ragas are best understood only if one approaches them through kritis and this was re-confirmed by the violinists.A dual-raga RTP (Revathy and Chandrakauns) was an engaging traversal where the ragas and violinists alternated with leading and directing phrases, spun with many threads but done unerringly.The concert then entered a phase which was a deluge of songs &#8212; &#8216;Kurai Ondrum Illai,&#8217; &#8216;Kanda Naal Mudhalai&#8217; and &#8216;Koovi Azhaithal,&#8217;  &#8216;Mudhugare Yashoda,&#8217; &#8216;Krishna Nee Begane,&#8217; Tillana (Desh), &#8216;Bhaagyaadha Lakshmi Baramma&#8217; and &#8216;Venkatachala Nilayam.&#8217; The songs and their number signify how the span of a concert can successfully showcase the potential of an artiste. It was a nice gesture to mention the tunesmiths for the songs rendered.Sanjeev had an individualistic approach and was at home in every department. He served both as a responsible accompanist and a nurturing companion.K.V.Prasad (mridangam) and Vaikkom Gopalakrishnan (ghatam) gave dignified laya support.  Their thani stood for the well-regulated fingering speeds and  nadai variations.
