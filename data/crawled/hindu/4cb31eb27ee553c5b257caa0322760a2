VFor his concert at Hamsadhwani's 16 {+t} {+h} NRI festival, Dr. Sanjay Subramanian, a physician in the field of critical care in the ICU of Providence Hospital, Seattle, U.S.A., had Pakkala Ramadas on the violin and Akshay Ananthapadmanabhan, a young lad from New Jersey on the mridangam. He had learnt the art from T.S. Subhashchandran.Dr. Sanjay opened his concert with &#8216;Era Napai' varnam in Thodi, in right earnest with swaras. The next was Dikshitar's &#8216;Panchamathanga Mukha Ganapathi' in raga Malahari and it looked like he was on the right path. The sruti-alignment was perfect, too.Unusual pieceThe vocalist chose Atana for alapana and it was free from blemishes. The kirtana was also an unusual piece, Ponnaiah Pillai's &#8216;Ambayanine Moralida' and here again it was a clean rendition of the sahityam.Before launching on an elaborate Kharaharapriya, Dr. Sanjay sang Tyagaraja's fast paced kriti &#8216;Nenarunchinanu' in Malavasri, as if warming up for a long musical presentation.It was a fairly long alapana of Kharaharapriya packed with manodharma, stretching into more than 15 minutes.Pakkala Ramadas, however, took less than half the time to sketch his version. When Dr. Sanjay began thanam, one guessed he was on RTP mode, but after the thanam (with mridangam accompaniment), he did not sing Pallavi, but a full kriti &#8216;Natachi Natachi Sucherayodhya' of Tyagaraja. The anupallavi line, &#8216;Pudamisudha Sahayudai' for niraval and swaraprastara followed.He took critical care of both the elements with alertness and never seemed to slip anywhere. That perhaps was due to sadhakam plus dedication.(However, why did he embark on tanam?) At the end, he sang Thooran's Tamizh song &#8216;Muruga Muruga' in Saveri and a Devarnama. Akshay's thani was a blend of enthusiasm and vidwat.
