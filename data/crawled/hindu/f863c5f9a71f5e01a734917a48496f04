VP. K. AJITH KUMARHe has composed the music for one of the finest albums of devotional songs in Malayalam, but P.K. Kesavan Nambudiri is hardly recognised even in his hometown. Not that he is complaining.For,  temples across Kerala are still playing songs from `Pushpanjali'  -   23 years after it was released. Rarely has one single album of devotional songs featured so many great tunes.Evergreen songsSongs such as `Vadakkumnathanu suprabhatham... ,' `Vighneswara janma nalikeram... ,' `Ambadi thannilorunni... ,' `Mookambike... ' and so on  could have been composed only by a gifted musician."I have never asked anyone for work, that is why I have done very little music outside All India Radio (AIR)," says Kesavan Nambudiri, who was in Kozhikode recently. He adds he has no regrets that he could not compose too many songs."Even `Pushpanjali' would not have happened if Ramesan Nair, my colleague in AIR, Thrissur, was a little less ambitious. He always wanted to be a lyricist and he had asked me on many occasions to compose some of his lines and get  P. Jayachandran, a close friend of mine, to sing those lyrics."Kesavan Nambudiri eventually agreed to do the album and Jayachandran did sing the songs. The result was an album that topped the charts. "We did not expect the album to do so well. And I never thought that my songs would be liked so much by people like Sivaji Ganesan and Lalithambika Antharjanam; I felt great when I was told that they loved my compositions."I remember the late L.P.R. Varma coming to my home late one night to say that no composer could have used the Hindustani raga Bilahari for a Malayalam song as well as I did in `Koodum pinikale... "' `Pushpanjali' was followed by another devotional album, `Vanamala.' The first song in `Vanamala,' `Guruvayarooppante pavizhadharam muthum... ' was sung soulfully by K.J. Jesudas.Team work"There has been some pressure on me to tune songs for a second edition of `Pushpanjali,' but I am not very keen. `Pushpanjali' worked because it was great team work. Besides, I don't think there is enough scope for an album like that today. People's tastes in music have changed a lot." He believes he has been able to compose some outstanding devotional numbers because he is a very religious person himself.Bottom Template Starts
