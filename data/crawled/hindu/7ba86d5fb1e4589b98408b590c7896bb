VOn the first day, veteran musician Chinglepet Ranganathan was conferred the title &#8216;Sangeeth Samrat&#8217; by C.R.Gopinathan, co-ordinator, Pongal Music Festival Committee. Bombay Jayashri  gave a pleasing recital accompanied by B. U. Ganesh Prasad on the violin, Poongulam S. Subramaniam on the mridangam and S. Karthick on the ghatam.The function began almost an hour late and the audience was getting restless, but Jayashri&#8217;s enchanting voice cast a spell on the rasikas who stayed on.  Significant compositions  were dedicated to Lord Ranganatha, with  &#8216;O Rangasayee&#8217; in Khambodi  as the centre piece. The  RTP was in Brindavana Saranga with the pallavi at &#8216;Sri Ranga Mangala Nidhim Aashraye.&#8217;The next morning,  Tyagaraja aradhana was celebrated at the same premises under the leadership of Vaidhyanatha Krishnan. Most of the prominent musicians of Coimbatore participated in the singing of the pancharatna kritis. N. Vijay Siva&#8217;s performance in the evening was wholesome and fulfilling. He was accompanied  very efficiently by Charumathi Raghuraman (violin) and  N. Manoj Siva (mridangam).Beginning with the varnam &#8216;Pagavari Bodhana&#8217; in Hamsadhwani, he presented &#8216;Premaswarupa Saarasa Lochana&#8217; (Ananda Bhairavi - Oothukkadu Subramaniya Iyer), &#8216;Talli Ninnu&#8217; (Kalyani - Shyama Sastri) and &#8216;Sri Rajagopala&#8217; (Saveri - Dikshitar) elaborately.Mala Chandrasekhar&#8217;s mesmerising flute recital was sheer joy to the ears. A bundle of energy and cheerfulness, she lit up the whole stage the minute she ascended it. Her music and smile seemed inseparable, as she let the melody flow through her fingers. She began with the varnam in Sankarabharanam and moved on to the popular &#8216;Gajavadhana Karuna&#8217; in Sriranjani by Papanasam Sivan.After a glistening delineation of Saranga, Mala began &#8216;Jnana Sabhaiyil Thillai&#8217; ( Sivan). Suddenly the power went off. The stage was lit only by the shimmering light of the jewel-like kuthuvilakku. The continuing melody from the flute enveloped the pandal making the darkness appear extremely pleasant. The generator brought back the power soon, but those two minutes of darkness were wonderful.Her RTP in Kalyani, with the pallavi &#8216;Un Darisanam Kidaikkumo Nataraja&#8217;  was another shining jewel, with swarakalpanas in Saveri, Kanada and Behag.V.V. Srinivasa Rao&#8217;s violin was the ultimate in melody , while Shertalai R. Ananthakrishnan on the mridangam and Kovai G. Suresh on the ghatam exhibited great camaraderie and talent. Malladi Brothers Sree Ram Prasad and Ravikumar presented a delightful concert that did not swerve from tradition, yet pleased everyone present. They began with &#8216;Ninne Koriyunnadhi&#8217; (Kanada varnam -Tiruvotriyur Thyagayya). Ravikumar portrayed Dharmavati with impeccable beauty, and the brothers followed it with &#8216;Bhajana Seya Raadhaa&#8217; by Mysore Vasudevachar. The niraval for the lines &#8216;Niravadhi Sukha Daayakuni&#8217;  was filled with ragabhava and  Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Sankara Dayaakaraa&#8217; (Harikhambodi) was sung with proper embellishment.After a swift &#8216;Naaga Gaandhari Raaganuthe&#8217; (Dikshitar), Sri Ram Prasad opened the vistas of Thodi journeying into the familiar as well as the unexplored beauties of the raga.Ravi Kumar joined him, complementing and supplementing. With immaculate diction and bhava, the brothers presented &#8216;Chesinadhella Marachitivo&#8217; in which Tyagaraja reminds Rama of his acts of mercy to Sita, Vibhishana and Hanuman, and wonders whether He has forgotten to show mercy on him alone.M.A.Krishnaswamy&#8217;s violin clearly exhibited the fragrance of experience. While being  supportive to the vocalists throughout, he rose to his full stature in the delineation of the ragas and his nimble fingers created marvellous music. Thani by K.V.Prasad on the mridangam and Kovai G.Suresh on the ghatam was brilliant and absorbing.In the junior slot, S.M.Vilasini, Rajeswari Saikrishna and Radha Sathyanarayanan presented vocal music. R.Padma Janani, R.Sai Jaya Harini, R.M.Swathi, G.Tarangini and V.Vaishnavi (disciples of Mohana Krishnan), sang Tiruppugazh in an admirable manner.
