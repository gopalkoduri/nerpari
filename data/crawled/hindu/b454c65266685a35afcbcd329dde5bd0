VTo commemorate Pandit Vasant Rao Deshpande&#8217;s 89th birth anniversary, Vasant Kala Vilas recently organised a concert of vocal music at the India Habitat Centre, inviting Suhasini Koratkar the well-known exponent of the Bhendi Bazar gharana from Pune. Trained under Pandit T. D. Janorikar, Suhasini is one of the very few exponents of this vanishing gharana, associated with ustads like Amaan Ali Khan who composed beautiful bandishes  under the pen name Amar. Suhasini&#8217;s recital proved that the musical values of this gayaki are sustained with considerable care by her.Suhasini opened her recital with raga Bihag which provided ample scope for employing the characteristic features of this gharana like thebeen-ang alapiwith meend,  systematic presentation of the bandishes, etc. The playful rhythmic treatment of sargam passages and bols added charm to her compositions inviting much appreciation from the audience. The next raga was Kalavati in which she presented two compositions in Roopak and Teen tala in medium and faster tempos one after the other. Suhasini believes that the raga is hidden in every composition and the beauty is diminished if you keep increasing the tempo of a particular composition which is not meant to be sung this  way.Her own composition in this raga, &#8220;Jhoolan Shyam jhulaaye&#8221;, was mesmerising.  She sang as if swinging the swaras and  lyrics of the  composition like a swing. The odd, rather rude interruption to present her a bouquet  in between the two compositions though, broke the flow of the concert.  The thumri Pilu and the concluding Bhairavi bhajan could not restore the spirits of either the artiste or the audience thereafter. Vinod Lele accompanied her on the tabla. The loud harmonium accompaniment by Jairam Potdar needed proper balancing although it had superb tonal quality.&#8216;Harmony&#8212; Sur &amp; Taal&#8217; a two day festival of classical and Sufi music was organised by Sumadhur Hansadhwani Trust at The Ashok&#8217;s theatre last weekend.  Vocalist Sumitra Guha opened the festival with raga Kedar, presenting a slow, a medium and a drut khayal and concluded with the famous composition of Ustad Aman Ali Khan in raga Hamsadhwani, followed by a tarana.Shubhendra and Saskia Rao presented a duet on sitar and cello. Saskia, a brilliant cellist from the Netherlands who has specialised in Indian classical music under Kaustav Ray  and Sumati Mutatkar among others,  has modified her cello to suit the requirements of Indian classical music and plays it with amazing ease.Shubhendra and Saskia opened their duet with an elaborate alap-jod-jhala in raga Maru Bihag, followed by two compositions in raga Charukeshi. The opening avroh (descending notes) of raga Maru Bihag on the tuneful tarabs of Shubhendra&#8217;s sitar was reciprocated by the deep soot  (glissando) of Saskia&#8217;s cello ascending from Mandra Pancham to Shadja. The duo gave an impressive performance, complementing each other.Parvati Baul and Hayat Mohammad Langa presented Sufi music, preceded by devotional songs by Sumitra Guha the next evening.
