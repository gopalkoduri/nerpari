VI ensure that first I understand the meaning of the ghazal and then expect the common man to appreciate it. What is the point of imposing lyrics on my fans if I don&#8217;t understand myselfEven the traditionalists concede he has brought ghazal out of the closet. His following has a wide base, from young to old, and it seems to be growing.The disciplined queue outside the Siri Fort, waiting for the doors to open, was a reflection of Jagjit Singh&#8217;s immense popularity.It was cold and windy and Jagjit was late in reaching because of a flight delay from Mumbai. But his audiences waited patiently to take their seats inside the cosy auditorium.The event was organised by  Action for Ability Development and Inclusion, formerly The Spastics Society of Northern India, to create awareness among the people, to provide direct services to people with disability. The 66-year-old Jagjit was thrilled like a child when asked to associate himself with this noble project.Ghazal was meant for a certain class, if not masses, but Jagjit&#8217;s singing has bridged the gap.&#8220;You have to understand the language,&#8221; he insists. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t understand the language, the essence of ghazal would be lost.&#8221;Jagjit, for obvious reasons, is judicious in picking his ghazals.&#8220;I ensure that first I understand the meaning of the ghazal and then expect the common man to appreciate it. What is the point of imposing lyrics on my fans if I don&#8217;t understand myself,&#8221; says the veteran.That was the precise reason why he chose some simple ghazals for a memorable evening, aptly called &#8220;Yaadein&#8221;, a journey through timeless classics.At no stage did Jagjit appear to be pushing himself. He innovated with his ghazals, interacted with the audience and enjoyed every bit.Jagjit, as is his wont, enthralled the gathering with his voice. His choice of ghazals was impeccable.He welcomed the audience with a 1993 hit &#8220;Zindagi Tuune Lahu Leke Diya Kuch Bhi Nahi&#8221; and then moved on to &#8220;Hosh Waalon Ko Khabar Kyaa Bekhudi Kyaa Cheez Hai&#8221;.On a request, he hummed the unforgettable Mirza Ghalib offering &#8220;Hazaaron Khwaaishen Aisi Ke Har Khwaaish Pe Dam Nikle&#8221;.Having gauged the mood of the evening, Jagjit came up with &#8220;Ye Daulat Bhi Le Lo Ye Shohrat Bhi Le Lo&#8221;, a must at most of his &#8216;live&#8217; performances, to be followed by &#8220;Apni Aankhon Ke Samundar Me Utar Jaane De&#8221; from the ageless &#8220;Beyond Time&#8221;, his first digitally mastered album, recorded in London 20 years ago.&#8220;Aap Ko Dekh Kar Dekhtaa Rah Gayaa&#8221; left the young audience ecstatic.During the break, Jagjit confessed he was in love with the gathering. A quick tea and he was back on the stage with some more improvised ghazals.Having spotted some elderly fans in the crowd, he next sang &#8220;Tum Itna Jo Muskuraa Rahe Ho&#8221; from &#8220;Arth&#8221;. The song evoked a spontaneous response from the audience, which was prompted into joining Jagjit.He obliged a request for &#8220;Shaam Se Aankh Me Nami Si Hai&#8221; penned by Gulzar for the album &#8220;Marasim&#8221;.The audience was in a trance. &#8220;Gulzar saab is special. I have done two albums with him and look forward to another.&#8221;Once again he invited the gathering to hum along &#8220;Tum Ko Dekhaa To Ye Khayaal Aaya&#8221;.A jugalbandi between Abhinav Upadhayaya on the tabla and Deepak Pandit on the violin lit up the evening. Javed Sheikh (dholak), Devendra Rajbhatt (flute), Atul Raninga (keyboard) and Girdhar Prasad (tabla) had their share of contribution too as Jagjit came up with &#8220;Pyaar Ka Pehla Khat Likhne Mein&#8221;, the evergreen &#8220;Baat Niklegi To Phir Dur Talak Jaayegi&#8221; and signed off with the all-time romantic hit &#8220;Sarakti Jaae Hai Rukh Se Naqaab Aahistaa Aahistaa&#8221;.&#8220;I feel privileged to be performing in front of such a wonderful audience,&#8221; he said as he left the venue, a delighted man.The audience reciprocated with a standing ovation for the maestro who has made ghazal singing an art that is understood by the masses, truly bringing it out of the closet.
