VA significant feature of the Thrissur-based Rasikapriya's monthly concerts is that each of them is a commemorative offering to eminent Carnatic musicians of yesteryear. The latest in this series was Pantula Rama's inspiring vocal recital that was held on the death anniversary of M.S. Subbulakshmi.Even as the vocalist from Andhra Pradesh paid rich tributes to the doyenne before the concert, her sense of propriety was evident in her meticulous selections of a few kritis that revived memories of the &#8216;Ganakokilam.'Dr. Rama's resonant voice, effortless rendition and keen sense of sruti made the three-hour concert an enthralling experience for rasikas. A stickler for tradition, Dr. Rama opened with a varnam &#8211; &#8216;Vanajakshi' in Kalyani, Ata tala, the much-sought-after composition of Pallavi Gopala Iyer. Then she moved to &#8216;Vande Vasudevam,' the composition of Annamacharya in Sree raga, Khanda chapu. The sloka in the beginning of the number provided a spiritual ambience to it.Eloquent alapana&#8216;Brova bharama,' the popular Tyagaraja kriti in Bahudari, Adi tala, had an eloquent alapana, gliding freely in the three sthayis.The abrupt start and the fast tempo in which &#8216;Sobhillu sapthaswara' was delivered captured the verve characteristic in the Tyagaraja composition in Jaganmohini, Roopakam tala. The selection was demonstrative of the erudition of Dr. Rama as a musicologist, for the kriti elaborated the technique of the production of &#8216;nada' in the human body.The rasikas walked down musical lane as Dr. Rama ventured into an ecstatic rendition of &#8216;Ranga pura vihara,' the Dikshitar composition in Brindavana Saranga, Roopakam, which was immortalised by M.S. Subbulakshmi.The raga had a short but sweet alapana as well. Swati Tirunal's &#8216;Bhogeedra sayanam' in Kuntalavarali and Jhampa tala seemed a fitting number before the second major raga, Panthuvarali.For the elders among the audience, the Tyagaraja composition &#8216;O Rangasaayi,' which the musician took up for elaboration, evoked memories of M.S. as the late musician had dwelt on the same number in her last concert in Thrissur, many years ago. Dr. Rama exhibited an uncanny penchant for bringing out the nuances of the enchanting Kamboji on an extended scale. She appeared very comfortable in doing so in the slow tempo of the number (vilambita kalam in &#8216;randu kala' choukkam).The neravals at &#8216;Bhooloka vaikundam' and swaras that ensued are sure to linger in the memory of the audience.A couple of melodies in Pahadi and Yamunakalyani with which she wound up provided much relaxation after the heavy rendition of Kamboji.While M.S.N. Murthy, Dr.Rama's husband, provided excellent support on the violin, V.V. Ramana Murthy's mridangam seized every opportunity to embellish the rendition.Adithyanellur Anil Kumar accompanied on the ghatom.
