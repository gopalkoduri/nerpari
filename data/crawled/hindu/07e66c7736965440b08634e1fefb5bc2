VMumbai-based Banyan Tree has delighted the music lovers of the Capital with their well conceived festivals at regular intervals. This time they came up with the unique concept of &#8220;Teen Prahar&#8221;, covering the ragas of morning, afternoon and evening, in a day-long festival spread over two sessions, from morning till night. The two-fold purpose of the concert was to provide a  platform to the young talents along with the known names, and to expose the audience to the ragas that are not heard in the regular night concerts. Featuring the best of the younger generation maestros-in-the-making and some established artistes in solos, duets and group ensembles of vocal and instrumental music, &#8220;Teen Prahar&#8221; was hosted recently by the India Habitat Centre.Opening with the reposeful Komal Rishabh Aasavari in drupad style vocal rendition by Sombala Satle, a talented disciple of Ustad Fariduddin Dagar, the concert proceeded to ragas Basant Mukhaari and Haripriya on flute by Rakesh Chaurasia, and Alhaiya Bilawal on sitar by Ustad Shujaat Khan, covering the entire array of morning and forenoon ragas with masterful delineations. Haripriya, played by Rakesh, was a combination of Sarang and Gorakh Kalyan, a raga created by Hariprasad Chaurasia. Shujat Khan&#8217;s superb portrayal of Alhaiya Bilawal created lasting impression with his soulful singing of the famous bandish (composition) &#8220;Sumiran kar man Rama naam tu&#8230;.&#8221; along with playing it on the sitar. Sudhir Pande and Arunaanshu gave him the most musical support on tabla.The afternoon session opened with Bhimpalasi, the most melodious raga of the afternoon, rendered passionately by Devaki Pandit. Presently under the guidance of Baban Rao Haldankar, Devaki was groomed earlier by gurus like Jitendra Abhisheki and Kishori Amonkar and her music bears the creative inputs of all her mentors. Heralding the evening with raga Shri, she continued with a medium tempo teen-tala composition and a tarana in Drut Ektala. Charmed by her mesmerising performance the audience would not let her go until she obliged with a Marathi Abhanga as the concluding item. She was ably accompanied by Suresh Phadtare on harmonium and Rohit Majumdar on tabla.The Carnatic and Hindustani jugalbandi was a great hit, with Jayanthi Kumaresh on veena and Ronu Majumdar on flute. Both, very talented artistes, gelled well in their captivating dialogue of raga Mohanam/Bhupali, which was followed by a Dhun in raga Kapi/Pilu. Known by different names in Carnatic and Hindustani music, both the ragas were equally popular in their respective regions. Sudhir Pande on tabla and Patri Satish Kumar on mridangam were brilliant in providing them percussion support.Taal India lead by Anindo Chatterji, with Patri Satish Kumar on mridangam and the vibrant folk artistes from Rajasthan on dholak, khadtala and Sindhi sarangi, sounded totally unrehearsed and needed coordination.The concert concluded with the meditative vocal recital of Mukul Shivputra, the gifted son and disciple of the legendary Kumar Gandharva. Mukul opened with a serene aalap preceding a medium tempo Jhaptala bandish (composition) in raga Sawani, followed by a teen-tala tarana in Sawani-Nat where the tinge of raga Nat in Sawani saw both the ragas in a friendly embrace. He sang another tarana set to Drut tin-tala in raga Jait-Kalyana, before concluding with Sohani-Pancham extending &#8220;Teen Prahar&#8221; to a midnight flavour. Suresh Phadtare on harmonium and Rohit Majumdar on tabla enjoyed accompanying the artiste who delved deep into the ragas he sang with intense involvement.
