VThe Andhra Music Academy, Visakapatnam, is paying homage to vaggeyakkaras by undertaking a sangeeta yatra (a musical journey). It began with a concert at the Kapaleeswara Temple, Chennai, and was followed by a second in the precincts of the Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple, Madurai, on October 27.At the Madurai event, lead singers, Manda Sudha Rani and Saraswathi Vidyarthi took turns to sing alapanas and kalpanaswaras while Subha lakshmi, Sruthi Ravali, and Nalini sang &#8216;Mahaganapathim' (Nattai) by Muthuswamy Dikshitar in chorus.Sudha Rani took charge of the first half of the concert and presented the works of several composers, bringing out the beauty of Syama Sastry's &#8216;Marivere Gati' in Anandabhairavi, Tyagaraja's &#8216;Nannu Anna Talli' in Sindhu Kannada and Subbaraya Sastry's &#8216;Vanajasana Vinutha' in Sri Ragam, with her deep voice and consummate skill.Though her alapanas were short and the focus of the concert was on the compositions, the experience was satisfying to the listeners. Subhalakshmi and Sruthi Ravali sang along with her and attempted to bring in variety by singing certain phrases in different stayis.Violinist Krishna was well attuned to the differing styles of the singers and excelled in the solo sessions. Madhu on the mridangam provided adequate support.Longer alapanasSaraswathi Vidhyarthi sang the composition of Dikshitar, &#8216;Madhurambika,' in Desi Simhavara, and those of Syama Sastry, &#8216;Mayamma' in Ahiri and &#8216;Nannu Brovu' in Lalitha. Her alapanas were longer and much applauded. The voices of Saraswathi and her daughter Nalini blended well. The alapana in Nalinakanthi was sung with finesse and creativity.The concert ended with all the singers chanting Meenakshi Pancharatnam.Sadguru Sivananda Moorthy, humanist, spiritual leader, and founder of Andhra Music Academy, presided over the concert. He is accompanying the singers in their tour of musical landmarks.They are scheduled to perform at the samadhis of Sadasiva Brahmendrar, Muthuswami Dikshitar, at the Padmanabha Swamy temple, at the golden temple in Vellore and finally in Perur.
