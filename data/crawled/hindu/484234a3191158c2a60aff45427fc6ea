VHARISH BALHer raga musings are meditative and shrutishuddha.  Bombay Jayashree sang to a full house at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Auditorium, Kochi.She began her concert on a feisty note with a Gowla kriti `Sree Mahaganapathim.'  Other than the main pallavi and the piece in Reethigowla, all her kriti renditions were in madhyamakala. The Tyagaraja kritis `Lavanya rama' in Poornashadjam and 'Mundu venuka' in Darbar were presented in all their majesty.The deep  timber Jayashree's voice achieves in the lower octave is a marvel to the ears.Rare ragaShe presented a detailed essay of the rare raga Bindumalini, a favourite of hers, as well as the Lalgudi school to which she belongs to. V.V.S. Murari, son of veteran violinist V.V. Subramaniam, provided able accompaniment. He focussed his alaapana on the upper middle octave. The vocalist'skalpanaswaraswere precise and she gave different swara endings at the eduppu.Jayashree went for a neatalaapanaof Reethigowla raga. She was straining in the upper octave. This was noticed again in her rendition of `Akhilandeshwari' in Dwinjavanthi in the line `jalli maddala jarjara vadya nada mudite.'  Her neraval in two speeds for Pattanam Subramanya Iyer's `Janani ninuvina' was creative and spontaneous.After `Maravairi Ramani' in Nasikabhooshani, the vocalist unfurled the full essence of the raga Shanmukhapriya in three phases.She sang superb raga malika swaras in Kanada, Mohana Kalyani and Sindhubhairavi before going for an all-embracing medley of the three ragas. M. Manoj Siva on the mridangam and Rajagopal on the kanjeera came up with   intricate laya patterns. Then the skies opened, drowning the music with the sound of the pouring rain.Hindustani numbersAs Jayashree is a specialist with Hindustani pieces, in the last lap of her concert, she sang an emotion-laden `Irakkam Varaamal' in Behag and `Bhavayami gopalabalam' in Yamunakalyani. An ashtapadi `Natha hare' in Bageshre and slokam `Vasudevasutham' in ragas Tilang and Vrindavanasaranga were tagged along with a Lalgudi tillana in Vrindavanasaranga.The concert was organised by Rasikapriya.Bottom Template Starts
