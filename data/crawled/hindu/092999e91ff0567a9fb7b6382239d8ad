VA. RAMALINGA SASTRYThe third evening of the five-day fete of music and dance, organised by Visakha Music and Dance Academy at Kalabharathi, featured young flautist  S. Shashank from Chennai. While Nagai R. Sriram and N. Govinda Rajan from Chennai excellently supported on violin and ghatam, local AIR staffer Vankayala Venkata Ramana Murthy lent vibrant support on mridangam.Starting with theBhairavi Ata taala varnam,Viribonias per the choice of the audience, Shashank left an impression of being an invincible flautist.TheaalapanasofSarasangiforNeekela Dayaradu,ChandrajyotiforBhagayeneyya,SaramathiforMokshamugalada,Savericoupled withtaanaminragamalikacomprisingKalyani,DwijavanthiandMohana,pallaviwith delightfully sublime sojourns intoRanjani,ValajiandMalayamaruthamappeared to be manifestation of the musician's genius and creativity.His indomitable mastery negotiatingswaraprastharamin break-neck speed was also amazing.Ramana Murty executingthaniwith Govinda Rajan appeared to be his peer in all aspects.VenkataachalanilayaminSindhubhairavi, a piece inKandanakuthuhalamandVandemaatharamcontributed a haunting finale.Vocal duetThe next day figured a recital by noted vocal duo, the Malladi brothers, Sriramkumar and Ravikumar.They are known for being in possession of good quality content which they imbibed with zeal in a large measure from their gurus, Sangeetha Kalanidhi Nedunuri Krishna Murty in particular.Understandably, theirs seemed to be an arduous effort simulating Nedunuri's style of rendition. Reflecting enough glimpses of such an appealing niche of their guru, including his mannerisms, the recital turned out to be a sumptuous feast of Carnatic music.Traversing a thoughtfully chosen repertoire constituted ofKambhojivarnam,Ninnujoochi Dhanyudaithi(Sowrashtram),Evarikai Avathaaramettitivo(Devamanohari) withneravuon the lyrical phraseVedavarnaneeyamouand briskswaram,Gowri Sukumari, a composition of the noted poet-musician-musicologist N.Ch. Krishnamachari, elaboration ofMathangee Raja Rajeswariof Deekshitar (Ramapriya) andKamalaabjakulaof Thyagaraja (Brindavanasaranga), they enthralled all alike.Then they spiritedly renderedragam,tanamandpallaviinSankarabharanam. TheswarakalpanainRagamalika(Saveri,MohanaandAmirkalyani), rendered in the reverse order to conclude, attracted resounding applause.H.N. Bhaskar on violin and Trichy Murali on ghatam from Chennai, in the company of AIR-Vijayawada staffer and adroit mridangist M.L.N. Raju, lent commendable support. Thethaniby Raju and Murty, replete with erudite exercises, contributed to the grandeur.Rendering of a couple of lyrics of Thyagaraja's rarekirtanas,Paahi Parama Dayalo, andKsheenamai Tiruya Janminchiand Annamayya compositions (all exquisitely set to tune by Nedunuri) constituted the absorbing tailpiece.Overwhelming soloThe Bharatanatyam solo by Malabika Sen followed by group dances including a few episodes from formerly performed ballets, marked the grand finale of the Visakha Music and Dance Academy's five-day fete in Kalabharathi.Malabika, who was initiated into Kathak and Hindustani vocal at the age of six, later had training in Mohini Attam and Bharatanatyam under the tutelage of noted gurus of the traditions. In the early 1990s, Malabika settled down with the noted guru of the Tanjorebaaniof Bharatanatyam, Tankamani Kutti.  She has also become synonymous with Kolkata Kalaamandalam, which was established by her guru along with the noted exponent of Kathakali, Govindan Kutti in 1968.Malabika'sPushpanjalifollowed by a composition describing the characteristic attributes of the Lord Ganapathi (Ananda Natanamidum Bhavayeset inGambheeranatainaaditalam) delightfully manifested an ineffable harmony between music and her dance. In the next item, apadavarnaminSankarabharanam, thenrittaseemed to vibrate with her romance with thelayaevery moment. Hernrityaalong with theabhinayaofAbhisaarikaandVirahotkanthikain tune with the lyrical content looked like achieving a bodily form of subtle emotions in her fine movements, fluid face and empathetically communicative eyes.Her dance forRathisukhasare, anashtapadiofjayadevainyamanleft an impression as if the picturesque sculptures have come alive on the stage evolving a flow of seamless plastic visions of the subtle and intricate human feelings. She concluded with theBrindavani Thillanaof Balamurali. Soaring like a bird on the intricatejathipatterns oflaya, she looked again crystallising a bodily form to the abstracttaalam. The second half comprising a few group dances and brief episodes from some of the ballets were also sublime and enchanting. TheDasaavataradance based on Jayadevaashtapadireplete with sculpturesque visualisation of the circumstances in which Mahavishnu manifests different forms, was the piece de resistance.Students of Kalaamandalam, Arpita Sen, Madhumita Samanta, Mounikha Chaterjee, Senjti Sengupta, Arpita Chakroborthy, Banmali Dutta, Jalsa Chandra and Jinook Mukherjee, participated in the recitals. The excellent backdrop of music had expert nattuvangam by Guru Tankamani Kutti and her son G. Mohan Kutti, evocative vocals by Sukumar G. Kutty, mirdangam by G. Suryanarayana,  A. Satyavishal (violin) and D. Raja Rao (flute).Bottom Template Starts
