VAnil Murthy sang under the patronage of Shri Krishna Gana Sabha, accompanied by H.K. Narasimhamurthy (violin), Ananthakrishna Sharma Anur (mridanga) and Shashishankar (ghata). The concert left an indelible favourable impression on the listeners by virtue of the ability the artist exhibited; accurate, felicitous and fluent. The manner in which the lyrics were rendered was charged with emotion and in no time struch a chord with the listener. In this matter, clear pronunciation of the text was another factor exercising significant influence on the faculty of his expressions convincingly carrying the essences of those lyrics to the listeners. Consider for example, &#8220;Shri Shakti Ganapathim Bhajeham&#8221; (Naata-Muthiah Bhagavathar) and &#8220;Saarasaaksha Paripalaya&#8221; (Panthuvarali-Swathi Thirunal) for a reasonable substantiation.An ideal tempo, falling between vilamba and madhyama kalas thoroughly facilitated a comprehendible recitation of the text, at the same time making ample allowance for musical elements to take definite shapes. In these instances, while the melody accompanist put forth his efforts to enhance the mood of the raga, the percussionists did an excellent job by metrically following the textual significance. Neraval at the charana, &#8220;Bhamini Samudayaashaya&#8221; (&#8220;Saarasaaksha&#8221;), reaching pleasing climaxes, was not an exception to any of the above merits.The element of accuracy was at its eminence in the artiste's keen sense of shruthi and in his discretion in employing the intricacies of laya. He would reach higher octaves with ease, and there was always a method in developing the passages. As the singer maintained composure, such escalations to the desired high pitches did not suffer any mitigation either in tonal qualities or in musical fineness.Ardent toil transformed into fluent extempore governed both the alapana and the swarakalpana sections, tastefully unfurling within the strict ambit of tradition. His extempore would not leave any chance for the patterns of the delineations of the raga and phrases of the swaras to repeat, in spite of near- exhaustive elaborations. In this respect, as if to vouch in substantiation of those observations, may be considered Raga-tana and pallavi in Shankarabharana.He treated the pallavi, &#8220;Ni Padamule Gati&#8221;, ideally to highlight the theme of the lyrics (as opposed to the common approach wherein artistes take the pallavi only as of means of exhibiting their rhythm-competence). With such an exemplary approach, the singer struck a good balance between lyrics, melody and rhythm. &#8220;Neranammithi&#8221; (varna-Atatala-Kaanada-Ramnad Shrinivasa Iyengar) was majestically presented, &#8220;Janani Ninuvina&#8221; (Rithigoula-Subbaraya Shastri) could have had more depth, &#8220;Aparadhamulanorva&#8221; (Rasavali -Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Kande Kandenu Krishnana&#8221; (Saveri-Vyasarayaru), was emotively sung, were other inclusions faithfully mirroring the above observations.
