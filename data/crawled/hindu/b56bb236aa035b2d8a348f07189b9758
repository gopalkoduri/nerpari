VJANUARY:Music chakra 10 is Disi (Direction) signifying a total of 10 directions &#8212; eight formed in an octagonal fashion and two in the vertical direction, Akash (above) and Pathal (below) indicated in the inset. It includes mela ragas 55-60 (Syamalangi, Sanmukhapriya, Simhendramadhyamam, Hemavathi, Dharmavathi, Nitimathi). The Dasavatara (10 avatars) of Vishnu are pictured &#8212; Mathsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parasurama, Rama, Balarama, Krishna and Kalki.The first three avatars &#8212;Mathysa, Kurma and Varaha &#8212; in the top row have the water element emphasised in the form of waves in the background. Each avatar is easily recognisable through characteristic features. For instance, Narasimha in his divine fury is red-hued, Vamana is depicted in the act of straddling the earth and the heavens and Kalki rides a galloping horse. Only two colours are used in the stippled background, blue-grey and brown, but the panels are deftly alternated to achieve maximum contrast, further set off by the verdant green of the inset. The focus is on the higher mental chakra located at the top of the forehead, a storehouse of universal knowledge, that rules special thought. The colour Indigo and the Tanzanite stone rule this month.FEBRUARY:Music chakra 11 is Rudra, referring to the 11  Devas &#8212; Aja, Dwasha, Eekapada, Thriambage, Aparajitha, Isana, Tribhuvana, Samboo, Hara, Rudra and Ahirputhniya &#8212; headed by Lord Siva. Adorned with the crescent moon, forehead smeared with ash, the figures dance across a grey background in joyous unison in a formation that wonderfully captures the dynamics of movement.It encompasses mela ragas 61-66 (Kanthamani, Rishabhapriya, Lathangi, Vachaspathi, Mechakalyani, Chitrambari). The colour cobalt blue flecked with gold and the semiprecious stone lapis-lazuli are favoured for this month. The focus is on the Face Chakra which is a repository of the energies that help us determine what we wish to become.MARCH:The last Music chakra 12 is Aditya indicating the group of 12 Suryas that exist in the cosmic Universe (Bhoosha, Bhaskara, Marichi, Argha, Kagha, Surya, Mithra, Aditya, Ravi, Bhanu, Savitha and Hiranyagarbha). Resplendent among the splendid heavenly bodies, Surya, the illuminator, is the deity who governs the region of the eye, conferring lustre. He is the sustainer of all living beings, nourishing and energising with his golden rays. In invoking him, the son of Aditi, incantations are imbued with immense power during the performance of Vedic rites for healing and mitigating sufferings.This chakra includes mela ragas 67-72 (Sucharitra, Jotiswaroopini, Dhatuvardhani, Nasikabhushani, Kosalam, Rasikapriya). The colour gold and the semi-precious Tiger Eye are the hue and the stone of the month. The spotlight is on the new Crown Chakra. Accelerating changes on planet Earth have resulted in extreme levels of electricity flowing into both our planet and our bodies. The energy of Gold allows the human body to move and balance at the highest level &#8212; the crown of the head.
