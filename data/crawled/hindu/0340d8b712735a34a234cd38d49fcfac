VFLUTE A.V. PRAKASH flanked by A.P. Srinivas (violin), G.S. Ramanujan (mridanga) and V.S. Ramesh (mrichhangi) at Ganabharathi's Veene Seshanna Bhavana, was a perfect meet of melody-makers.The initial blow in Kedaragoula leading to "Samidayajuda" (Thiruvottiyur Thyagayya)set the standard very high. "Maha ganapathim smarami satatam" in Nata (Dikshitar), alapanas in Latangi, Bilahari and Shuddhasaveri were delectable items. The respective kritis "Marivere dikkevvare" (Patnam), "Inthakannandamemi" (by Tyagaraja) were replete with creative ideas. A raga-tana-pallavi would have eminently fitted into the mould created by Prakash. While individual items were quite charming, the concert on the whole sounded as an assemblage of random thoughts.G.T. NARAYANA RAOBottom Template Starts
