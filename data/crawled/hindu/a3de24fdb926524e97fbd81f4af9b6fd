VSrikantam Nagendra Shastri, accompanied by Nalina Mohan (violin), B.K.Chandramouli (mridanga), and M.A.Krishanamurthy (ghata), presented a vocal concert at the MES Kalavedi, Bangalore, last weekend.The concert commenced with the Thyagaraja composition &#8220;Guruleka Etuvanti&#8221; in Gourimanohari raga and khanda chapu thala, aptly prefixed with the sloka &#8220;Gurave Sarvalokanam&#8221; and embellished with a short neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Thathvabodhana Jesi&#8221;. A crisp alapana of Arabhi, Thyagaraja's &#8220;Nadasudharasambilanu&#8221; in rupaka thala, and compact kalpana swaras were followed by &#8220;Sudhamadhurya Bhashana&#8221; in Sindhuramakriya raga and adi thala, another of the saint composer's krithis, also presented with a brief alapana and kalpana swaras.Deekshithar's &#8220;Ranganayakam&#8221; in Nayaki, in which the subtle nuances of the raga blended beautifully with the measured cadence of the sahithya, was followed by an alapana of Vachaspathi that unveiled a chiseled and polished image of the raga. &#8220;Kantajudumi&#8221; in adi thala featured an energetic neraval at &#8220;Alanadu Soumithri&#8221;, and kalpana swaras that bore testimony to the artiste's expertise in, and penchant for, rhythmic swara sequences. An incandescent alapana of Behag, deftly highlighting the placement of the two madhyamas and the two nishadas, preceded &#8220;Yellirove Thande Baro&#8221;, to which was appended a vibrant thani avarthana.While the vocalist's erudition and technical skill were evident in the mellifluous fluidity of the renderings, the lack of a major krithi reinforced with a full complement of alapana, neraval and kalpana swaras, was keenly felt. Also, finer balancing of the sound system would have augmented the earnest efforts and skill of the accompanists.The Sri Thyagaraja Gana Sabha Trust hosted by a veena recital by Vani Yadunandan, accompanied by V.S.Rajagopal (mridanga), and G. Omkar (ghata), recently.A sure touch and a dulcet tone were revealed in the opening item, Muthaiah Bhagavathar's daru varna &#8220;Mathe&#8221; in Khamas raga and adi thala. &#8220;Aparadhamulan&#8221; in Lathangi, &#8220;Munduvenaka&#8221; in Durbar, and &#8220;Sangeetha Gnanamu&#8221; in Dhanyasi were rendered in quick succession, each preceded by succinct bhava imbued alapanas and suffixed with brief kalpana swaras. While the elaboration of Mohanam that followed was suffused with sweetness, especially in the thara sthayi sancharas, the Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Evarura&#8221; in misra chapu thala was adorned with lively yet lilting kalpana swaras.Hindolam was next taken up for an alapana that incorporated delicate touches and effectively heralded the sublime Deekshithar composition &#8220;Neerajakshi Kamakshi&#8221; in rupaka thala. The fine presentation of the krithi was accentuated by exemplary percussion support. However, a more comprehensive treatment of at least one raga before the main item would have strengthened the concert structure and enriched listening pleasure considerably.The weighty gamaka laden expansion of Bhairavi, the main raga of the evening, and the ensuing well contoured thana, were infused with classical purity, notwithstanding a couple of minor slips in the thara sthayi. Thyagaraja's &#8220;Thanayuni Brova&#8221; in adi thala incorporated kalpana swaras in two speeds, including several rhythmic patterns and ending with a spell of diminishing number of avarthanas at the panchama, and was followed by a scintillating thani avarthana. The concert concluded with the well known thillana in Jinjhuti.
