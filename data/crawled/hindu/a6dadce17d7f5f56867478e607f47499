VIGNCA, Veena Foundation and Narada Gana Sabha together celebrated Veena Navarathri at the sabha's mini hall, which concluded with an Akhandam.&#8216;Harmony of Strings for Human Harmony,' as it was called, featured 50 concerts, saw 55 veena artists and as many accompanists in participation, and also provided the much-needed opportunity for many deserving artists to perform.The sitar and the chitravina were featured on the sixth day. Janardhan Mitta gave a useful introduction about the sitar - its origins, the Persian Amir Khusro's role vis-&#224;-vis the sitar and other positive influences made on the development of the instrument.Janardhan's involvement and playing enriched the tonal quality of the sitar as he began with a common evening raga Purya Kalyan.He presented the alaap, the jhod and the jhala with its associated variations in all its tempos and presented a composition in teen tal.What followed was a ragamalika that had its main portion in Peelu. The concert ended with a Dhun type number in Sindhu Bhairavi. Chandrajit on the tabla was a picture of unbound enthusiasm and often exceeded his brief.The melodic hues from the strings of the sitar are perhaps the gentlest and the subtlest, warranting a learned reticence from the laya accompanist.In contrast, one only heard gapless thumping on the tabla, which by a stroke of fortune got mellowed during the final phase.Amazing alacrityRavikiran has the ability to get to the crux of a raga with amazing alacrity and his deliberative phrases bring to light his creative endeavours. The single cumulative phrase he projected for Thodi (&#8216;Ne Mora Bettithe,' Tyagaraja) during his alapana, showed how assiduously he has studied the rich nuances of the raga. (The audience applauded spontaneously as this phrase came to its close). His commencement was with &#8216;Smarane Sukhamu' (Janaranjani, Tyagaraja) and &#8216;Neelayadakshi' (Shyama Sastry, Paras) came next.The familiar &#8216;Parathpara' (Vachaspati, Sivan) had a beguiling sangati for the line, &#8216;Aadhi Andham Illa,' showing again that a strong relationship exists between vidwat and well-cultivated aesthetic values.Sundareswaran on the violin followed with attention and put all his abilities into action while rendering fine alapanas and answering for the swaras.K.R. Ganesh on the mridangam provided formidable and authentic laya combinations in the thani working Anirudh Athreya's (ganjira) support and enthusiasm to good advantage.B. Kannan, who was in charge of this event, (with the wise overall counsel of Raghurama Iyer) deserves special praise for the unstinted efforts taken to put up the festival.(sivakumar2004@gmail.com)
