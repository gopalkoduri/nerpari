VAfter what seemed to be a brief lull, a series of concerts took the music lovers of Tiruchi   on a musical voyage.The L.V.Memorial concerts organised by the Rasika Ranjana Sabha at  FGN Hall recently saw both the beginners and professionals  presenting an excellent fare.The eight-day festival  witnessed  Sri Latha, Subha Ganesan, O.S.Thyagarajan and R. Ganesh perform.Elaborate alapanasWhile Manakkal S. Rangarajan presented elaborate raga alapanas on the second day, the final day was fast-paced with Sudha Raghunathan giving out the right mixture of kritis and tukkadas.Beginning her concert  with the evergreen kriti in Nattakurinji, "Karpaga Vinayagane Potri," Sudha Raghunathan advanced to a series of raga alapanas.  "Marukelara O Raghava" in Jayanthasri was mellifluously sung followed by a couple of Tyagaraja kritis.Subbaraya Sastri's "Janani Ninnuvina" was well received by the audience."Karthikeya Gangeya Gowri Thanaya" in Todi was yet another highlight of the concert.If the first phase of Sudha's recital was replete alapana and neraval the second phase was soaked in bhakti rasa.Pakkala Ramadoss on the violin,  Raman on the morsing,  and Sivaraman on the mridangam were the accompanists.S.
