VThe sanctity and pious relevance of Lord Venkateswara and his abode &#151;  the Hills of Tirumala &#151;  has to be explained in detail for any North Indian to know the significance behind the teeming millions  who visit the shrine. For several in the Vindhyas who would want to have an insight into the historical background of Mahavishnu's 10 avataars in Kritayug, Tretayug, Dwaparyug and the Kaliyug's Venkateswara and understand the nitty-gritty of Tirupati utsavs, the DVD, `Sri Balaji Darshan,' with a Hindi commentary, produced by Anand Reddy of Sea Records, Chennai, provides a structured explanation of the Brahmotsavam and Srivarisevasand takes you on an explanatory tour to Tirumala, Tirupati and Tiruchanur.The cool  greenery of the Seven Hills and the wide-angle pan shots that capture the essence of the subject for elucidating Vrisha Badri, Neeladri, Anjanadri, Seshadri, Garudadri, Narayanadri and Venkatadri and moving along the Adivarahaswamy at the Pushkar offers a feast for both your eyes and ears. This Adivarahaskhetra explains why it is `one among the 108punya sthalsof Vaishnavaites.' Following the legend of Brahmadev who prayed to Adivarahaswamy and Venkatachalapati, it is believed that the creations of the Lord would be relieved of sins just by stepping on the holy soil of Tirumala, especially during the 10-day Brahmotsavam celebrations. Everyvaahanof the Lord, the pujas and the inbuilt connotations engrained in the tradition is expounded in the voice-over and illustrated well with scenes of the various  avatars of God on his variousvaahans.Colourful elephants, crowds bursting at the seams, glitter of the precious stones adoring the Lord and colourful kolattam are some in the interesting videography.Inclusions of Hindi songs, mantras, and slokas from Suprabatham, Mukundamala, and Purushasooktham make the DVD aurally rich too while background music of well-known musicians is varied and relevant. The script by Srinivasdas and voice by M. Nageswara Rao are  crisp.Some interesting observations explained for the North Indians are: As incredibly as the swan which separates the water content from milk, the reigning deity of the seven hills too, on Hamsavahan, relegates the paap and blesses the bhakta based on his punya.As the powerful snake transforms itself as a vehicle for the Lord during the Seshavahan and Chota Seshavahan in the Brahmotsavam celebrations, the essence of the Sharanagati Tatva explains the moral behind this utsav.The initial prayers offered at the Dwajarohan utsav and Garudotsav is to pray for an unscathed living with high moral values, while Garuda, requested by the Lord himself to stay in the hills, guards the skies from anything untoward coming by.RANJANI GOVINDBottom Template Starts
