VAn interesting DVD recently brought out by Aditya Music (India) happens to be the recording of a live concert held at the Chowmahalla Palace in Hyderabad.This album features a percussion ensemble by the ghatam exponent T.H. Vinayakaram and other artists. The grand finale is the vocal rendering of a thillana by Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna to the vibrant accompaniment of Vinayakaram.Involved renderingThe DVD commences with a vocal rendering of a sloka ' Chidambaram Bhaja ' and a Tamil verse in praise of Sri Chandrasekara Saraswathi of the Kanchi Math. Uma Mahesh sings these with a lot of involvement to the accompaniment on the rhythm pad, gethu vadyam and morsing.Vinayakaram commences his playing which is at once powerful and draws the attention of the viewer.Another verse on the Kanchi seer in khanda gati is a joint presentation by all the artists who recite the jathis and sahitya in a format resembling kauthuvams as presented in Bharatanatyam recitals.This elicits a good round of applause from the audience. The thani avarthanam in Adi tala is gripping and the effect of the gumki is a pleasure to listen to. Umashankar and Rajaram actively join on the ghatam during this session.The Kuntalavarali thillana of Balamuralikrishna is sung by the composer himself to the percussive beats on the ghatam.Balamurali and Vinayakaram alternately sing and play the jatis with all their variations. The arohana and avarohana of Kuntalavarali SMPNDS-SNDPMS have been spelt out as part of the charanam sahitya portion.This short DVD would be of interest to those who are looking for a change from heavy classical fare.
