VJAYARAMAN VPerumbavur G. Ravindranath is attuned to his listeners. Being both a traditional vocalist and a popular composer of light music helps him project the main flavour of a raga to create an impact on his listeners. He garnishes all major compositions with a vivid group of swaras.Rasikasat the concert at Kalikotta Palace, Thripunithura, organised by G.N. Swamy Trust, got an opportunity to listen to his concert, which was steeped in sampradaya. The methodology he showed in embellishing `Mahagnapathim' in Natta, composed by Muthuswami Dikshitar, with a flurry ofkalpanaswaras,was reflective of his erudition and perception of kutcheri discipline.SubtlegamakasDikshithar's `Sree Varalakshmi Namasthubhiam' in Sree Ragam was resplendent  in a leisurely vainika style. The subtle gamakas and delicate sangathis employed by the vocalist added to the lustre of the song.  It is said that Tyagaraja had made use of several types ofmudrasin his compositions and `Naadathanumanisam' in Chitharanjini has the stamp of `Tyagarajapaalam' in it. It was rendered in medium tempo.`Seethamma Mayamma' (Vasantha set to Roopaka tala), replete with a devotional streak by Tyagaraja, was sung with suitable time measure and both the compositions were supplemented by swaras. After `Padmanabha Paahi' in Hindolam, composed by  Swati Tirunal, Ravindranth rendered Reethigowla.`Meenakshime mudam,' a Dikshitar piece on the shrine at Madurai was decked with niraval and swaras.S.A Eswara Varma on the violin gave adept accompaniment. Mavelikkara S.R. Raju played the mridangam while Adichanallur Anil Kumar was on the ghatom and Neyyantinkara Krishnan on the mukharsankhu.Bottom Template Starts
