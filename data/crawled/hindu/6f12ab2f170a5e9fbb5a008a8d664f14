VSea Records SD CD CCV 2031&#151;  Carnatic Classical Vocal &#151;  Master Shankaran Namboodiri &#151;  Price not indicated.MASTER SHANKARAN Namboodiri, disciple of T. V. Gopalakrishnan, has blossomed into a full-fledged vocalist since the days he was acclaimed as a child  prodigy.His CD  beginning with the Arabhi ratna of Tyagaraja, "Sadinchene," with a lively gait, infuses infectious enthusiasm.Todi is a commendable exposition of the boy's innate musical sensitivity, and it is to the guru, T. V. Gopalakrishnan's, credit that the alapana is free of irrelevance and blots on the lakshana canvas.The violinist, one of the TVG brothers as mentioned in the album, plays a mature alapana with the melody motif in full flow. A neat version of `Dasarathe' serves as a platform for the tani avartanam between the ghatam and the mridangam, played by TVG himself.The artiste's ability to focus on the swaroopa of the raga is well reflected in his interpretation of Kalyani, lacing it with karvais and melodic prayogas in different kalapramanams. The oral range is praise-worthy with the phrases in the tara sthayi even traversing above the panchamam, emerging loud and clear. "Nammivachina," one of the Kovur gems of Tyagaraja replete with niraval and swaras, is indicative of the singer making a mark in his pursuit of classical music.SPNew releaseCoinciding with the mood of Sivarathri, Sea Records (2814 3050) has released three CDs. The Sanskrit slokas in Sri Sivamahima and Karavalamba Stotras, Sri Siva Ashtakas, Sri Dakshinamoorthi Stothram and Siva Smaranam, Panchakshari Stothram and Ashtothara Sathanamavali (each priced at Rs. 325) have been soulfully rendered by Nishantala Suryaprakasa Rao, Mano, Ramu and Ramana. J. Purushotama Sai has set the hymns to tune.Bottom Template Starts
