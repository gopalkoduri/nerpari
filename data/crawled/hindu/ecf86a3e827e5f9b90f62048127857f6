VThe hall adjacent to the lush green garden of Vice President's house was brimming with music lovers when Salma and Hamid Ansari invited them for an informal baithak of vocal recital by Chinmaya Gharekhan the other day. Most of them knew Ghare Khan as the President of Indira Gandhi National Centre of Arts (IGNCA) and as the Chairman of Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan's Delhi centre or at the most a serious sangeet rasika; but none expected him to be such a serious practitioner of Hindustani classical music. Very apologetically, he introduced himself, &#8220;Sorry for forcing this concert upon you because an invitation from the Vice President sounds like a command, but he has invited you to listen to a friend and not a professional gavaiyya.&#8221;The evening came out to be a pleasant surprise when he opened his concert with Yaman, a melodious evening raga, and developed it most meticulously with fertile imagination; singing a traditional composition of Sadarang set to slow Jhoomara tala. The gradual barhat (elaboration) with aalap and bol-aalap and the effortless ease in the Gamak taans spoke not only of his riyaaz but also of his musical temperament, the tabiyatdaari. The Chhota khayal, &#8220;Piya ki najaria&#8230;&#8221;, and the following tarana were equally enjoyable.Raga Jog was his next detailed presentation with three compositions before he presented a couple of compositions in Hansadhwani and concluding his recital with a bandishi Thumri in Bhairavi. His consistent tunefulness and an inner sense of rhythm were the remarkable features of his music along with his chaindaari, the relaxed demeanour in which he enjoyed even the accompanying artists, Vinay Mishra on the harmonium and Idris Khan on the tabla.On wanting to know his musical background, he said, laughing, &#8220;Though I have been in the foreign services for 40 years I was always interested in classical music and am still a serious listener. As far as musical background is concerned I learnt vocal music under Pandit Amarnath while I was posted as deputy secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs in the 1960s for two-three years. I had to discontinue because of my foreign assignments, but I started learning from Shanti Sharma, my guru behen, in 2001-2002 and continued till her unfortunate death. My mother had a melodious voice, like a silver bell. I grew up listening to her devotional songs. In my college days I used to sing bhajans and Gujarati songs for All India Radio. I won the first prize in the inter-college music competition where the famous playback singer Mahendra Kapoor also competed. While I was training under Pandit Amarnath I once asked his permission to sing light music on AIR, but he discouraged me and asked me to concentrate on classical music only.&#8221;Asked how does he take out time for his regular riyaaz, he said, &#8220;Music is not my hobby, it is my passion. It is in my mind all the time. You don't have to take out time for your love. Reading is my hobby and I used to read professional literature related to foreign affairs,since Ijoined the IGNCA I have been trying to read books on Indian arts and culture. I've just finished reading Bharaat's &#8216;Natya Shastra' and intend to read &#8216;Sangeet Ratnakar' next, because Shanti ji used to tell me that the &#8216;khand-meru' (permutation and combination of swaras) has been explained in great detail there.&#8221;
