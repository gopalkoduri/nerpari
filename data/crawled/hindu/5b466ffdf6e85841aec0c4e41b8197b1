VDid you know that the unforgettable love song &#8220;Char Dinon Ka Pyar Hai Rabba&#8221; was a devotional song? Did it occur to you that &#8220;Dama Dam Mast Kalandar&#8221; that sounds like a number from a rock band, was indeed a folk song about the relationship between God and the believer? Would it surprise us to know that nine out of ten film songs in India were based on classical ragas or popular folk tunes?A Sufi music performance by Adil Husseini in Bidar recently not only succeeded in elevating the crowd to higher levels, but also provided answers to some of these questions. The 27 -year old singer from Hyderabad presented a variety of songs based on Sufi music. They included folk songs from India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. He also sung several film songs based on Hindustani Ragas and folk tunes.He began the five hour performance by singing devotional and philosophical pieces. Later, he sang hit numbers like &#8220;Alla Hu&#8221;, &#8220;Mast Kalandar&#8221; and &#8220;Afreen&#8221;. They also included recent film songs like &#8220;Dil ToBachcha Hai&#8221;, &#8220;Tujh Bin Jina&#8221; and &#8220;Chaliya Re&#8221;. But the last section comprising of songs based on Hindustani ragas drew the loudest applause. He presented small pieces based on Pilu, Khamaj, Mand, Pahadi, Des and Bairagi Bhairav Ragas.As the temperature outside kept falling, Husseini's voice kept the environs warm. His voice is sweet and seemed very mature for his age. He brought out the details in the notes and his timing seemed nearly perfect. Sufi music is known for its liberal styles of singing and he proved to be a worthy exponent of Sufi singing. However, the concert will be remembered for a reason other than his singing. He represented the typical Hyderabadi style of qawwali singing that includes an explanation to the lyrics and provides details of the music styles.Husseini spoke of how classical music influenced film music and how many old and recent film songs were based on Ragas. This led the listeners to think about how new film songs are created everyday in Mumbai and Chennai using folk tunes and how the celluloid songsters morph them into new entities that don't reveal their origins.
