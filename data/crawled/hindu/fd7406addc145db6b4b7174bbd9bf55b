VGanabharathi, Mysore, had arranged a Carnatic vocal recital by Shriram Bhat, a versatile artiste, adept in Hindustani music, mridanga and harmonium. Naturally, one may expect music filled with an essence of all the necessary elements of classical music, which would render it pleasing and impressive, and in fact, this was what the present recital was all about &#8212; fulfilling that aspiration of the listeners.Aditi Krishnaprasad (violin) and Shrinivasa Prasad (mridanga) accompanied the artiste enthusiastically.The voice is melodious; a certain element of vigour would have rendered it magisterial. As to its gamut &#8212; the singer reaches either the lower octaves or the higher one with admirable ease. The chords have that gentleness that can make deep impressions on the listeners. And genuine involvement imparting profound depth to his penchant for the art form ensures an experience that can sustain itself in the mind for a long time.His general style is oriented mainly to highlight the significance of the lyrics and to embellish them, appropriate with the moods they are intended to convey. Another exceptional merit that vouched for his fine taste was the fact that in the entire concert he did not succumb to any undue temptation or indiscreet inspiration to mix different styles he was well versed with, for the purpose of any ostentatious instant gains.The concert was in memory of the renowned musician Chakrakodi Narayana Shastri, who was also a composer; and incidentally, the concert included one of his Sankrit compositions dedicated to Ramana Maharshi. Shriram Bhat elaborated Shahana before presenting the lyrics, &#8220;Shri Arunachala Ramanam&#8221;.The pattern of building up the raga and the vocal inflections he effected while reciting the text collectively complemented the core tenor of the composition. He could have appended a few strains of kalpanaswaras to enhance the intensity of the impact.Most of the selections suited his refined style, ideal objective and gentle predisposition. &#8220;Guruleka Etuvanti&#8221; (Gourimanohari-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Janani Ninuvina&#8221; (Rithigoula-Subbaraya Shastri), &#8220;Ramanatham Bhajeham&#8221; (Kaashiramakriya/ Kamavardhini-Dikshithar) and similar ones constituted such a list treading an ideal pace, facilitating clarity in lyrics at all levels.Composed alapana in Kashiramakriya, pleasing neraval at the anupallavi (Kumara Guruguha) and fluent swarakalpana enriched &#8220;Ramanatham Bhajeham&#8221;. By intelligently framing the phrases in the purvanga of the raga and by characteristically omitting panchama (not entirely) while articulating, the imaginative singer imparted unique shades to the developments. This was so while framing the kalpanaswaras too.Patnam's varna (Sarasuda-Saveri), Thyagaraja's &#8220;Paalintuvo&#8221; (Kaanthamani), Basavanna's &#8220;Ninolidare Koradu&#8221; (Dhvijavanti), Purandaradasa's &#8220;Kande Na Govindana&#8221; (Tillang) and Kanakadasa's ugabhoga (Hasivarithu) were other inclusions.V.
