VSemi-classical devotional singing, not to be interpreted as &#8216;light' music, is doing the rounds these days. And Aruna Sairam fits the bill to a &#8216;T'. She has made it her mainstay, though she is well-versed in the traditional Carnatic classical. This was amply visible in the South Indian Cultural Association's (SICA) monthly concert, co-sponsored by Ella Foundation (Krishna and Suchitra Ella). Her fan following also testified the preferences of the present day audience.Splitting the first half into classical style and the second into devotional, Aruna rendered quite a few kritis beginning with Sri Vignarajam Bhaje (Oothukkadu) in Gambheera Nata then went on to Ganamurthe. A Thyagaraja kriti in the title raga, Balakanakamaya&#8230;ela nee daya raadu in Atana, Enna gaanu Rama bhajana (Ramadas), a navavarana (Dikshitar) kriti in Anandabhairavi, Rangabaro (Purandaradasa) and then the main piece in Thodi, the popular Thaye Yashoda which was rather brief. Stylistic improvisations marked all her songs with her trademark extended pause after one cycle of swarakalpana, which was mistook, at least for the first time, as the end of the piece, after which the momentum picks up from where it was abruptly jettisoned. It looked unique if one is used to Aruna Sairam's style of rendition.Musical licence, like poetic licence, does not find universal acceptance. The &#8216;narakantakaja' in Ganamurthe dragged on the &#8216;ja' syllable as was &#8216;ramani' spelt out as &#8216;raamuni'! But for these minor flaws, Aruna regaled her audience with her wide repertoire and her warm response to her listeners' requests. That's where an artist scores. Pillamgrovi in Mohana, an Abhang of Tukaram, her forte, Vishamakara kannan (Kurinji), O Rama nee namamentho ruchiraa (Ramadas), a piece on Durga Kali (of Kolkatta) and Tirumala Venkatachala, etc. rippled like rivulets in full swing.Her expressiveness gestures complemented the tuneful lyrics like Vishmakara kannan. Her intonation is in keeping with the nuances of that language in which she chooses to present a particular piece. If the gathering at the Ravindra Bharati auditorium is anything to go by, it can be safely stated that Aruna Sairam enjoys a popularity that no other artist does on the Carnatic music front. Raghavendra Rao on the violin, Murali on the ghatam and Vaidyanathan on the mridangam just about fit the bill.
