VThe fourteenth Pongal music festival organised by the Coimbatore Kendra of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan began with the conferment of the title &#8216;Sangeeth Samrat&#8217; on the flute maestro,  N. Ramani and the presentation of Kovai Subri Muruga Gan\u000aa award to Kovai K. Kannan (Faculty of Bhavan&#8217;s Dept of Fine arts, Coimbatore Kendra) in the presence of a large gathering of rasikas assembled at the tastefully decorated auditorium of the Bhavan. The citation of the award presented to the veteran flautist referred to his introduction of many innovations in the field of Carnatic music and his training of many disciples to carry on his musical mission.The sparkling vocal concert of Ranjani and Gayatri following the award ceremony was memorable for the display of the duo&#8217;s knowledge of the intricacies and nuances of Carnatic music. Their mature interpretations mellowed with performing finish in every item they presented. &#8216;Evaribodha&#8217; (Abhogi) was the curtain-raiser and the vocalists&#8217; presentation of the following piece, &#8216;Vallabha Nayakasya&#8217; (Begada) was an earnest effort.The rakti of Ranjani&#8217;s Lathangi alapana for the kriti, &#8216;Kandajudumi&#8217;  moved around finesse and the lyricism of the item  were reflective of the bard&#8217;s plea to bestow His grace on him. The niraval at &#8216;Alanadu Sowmitri Paada Seva&#8217; advanced smoothly with emphasis on the upper register. The delineation of Thodi with key phrases by Gayatri highlighted the middle octave and the song, &#8216;Thanigaivalar Saravanabhava&#8217; was rendered with commendable fluency. After a brisk rendition of &#8216;Thaye Tripurasundari&#8217; (Suddha Saveri), Ranjani&#8217;s alapana of Mohanam gave a clear and solid base for Gayatri to drape it and build a gleaming edifice in the tara sthayi.Their interpretation of &#8216;Mohanarama&#8217; was the veneer of performance appeal. They ended their concert with an Abhang. Amrita Murali&#8217;s violin accompaniment was dependable despite occasional swara slippages noticed in her solo versions of Thodi and Mohanam. Sriram (mridangam) and Gopalakrishnan (ganjira) played their roles as percussionists with competence.Gayatri Venkatraghavan&#8217;s  recital  commenced with a vibrant rendering of &#8216;Jagadanandakaraka&#8217; in Nattai, one of the Pancharatna kritis of Saint Tyagaraja, striking a chord with the listeners. The brisk pace continued with &#8216;Varanamukha&#8217; with swara passages. In her raga delineation of Pantuvarali devoid of any frills, the brigha-oriented phrases peppered with long karvais revealed the process of her internalisation admirably. The kriti, &#8216;Pirava Varam Thaarum&#8217; was backed by a neat niraval and imaginative swaraprastharas. Her attractive Hindolam alapana with full-toned karvais using akaras brought out the radiant beauty of the raga for the kriti, &#8216;Maanavakula Bhushana.&#8217; Her exquisite manodharma came to the fore when she built the stong edifice of Kambodhi, the main piece of the kutcheri with key phrases spotlighting the madhyama and dhaivata in the middle octave for Tygaraja&#8217;s &#8216;O! Rangasayee.&#8217; The niraval at &#8216;Bhooloka Vaikunta&#8217; helped the listener perceive the hidden ecstatic possibilities of the raga. &#8216;Thaye Tripurasundari,&#8217; &#8216;Kaliyuga Varadan,&#8217; &#8216;Vellaithamarai Pooviliruppaal&#8217; and &#8216;Maayamma&#8217; were the other items on the vocalist&#8217;s agenda.Charumathi Raghuraman&#8217;s dulcet notes on the violin, be they solo versions of ragas or swara repartees, were song soporific to the aficionados. She is destined to go places and she has a bright future. Anantakrishnan on the mridangam garnished the kritis with understanding and partnered Krishna (ghatam) in a vibrant thani with symphonic beats.The robust classicism in the presentation of compositions revealed Sanjay Subramaniam&#8217;s  good homework.The kutcheri stood out for his svanubhava in the treatment of Khamas, Mohanam and Behag giving an emotional tinge. His own inimitable way of prayogas, jarus and lavish brigas had vim, vigour and vitality in the items handled. His impressive start with &#8216;Viribhoni&#8217; varnam in Bhairavi in medium tempo with swaras was followed by &#8216;Tatvamariya Tharama&#8217; (Ritigowla) embellished with swara passages. The rasikas were astonished by his impressive artistry in the song, &#8216;Paadavendume&#8217; in Hamsanadham. His combative exuberance was tantalising while exploring the different facets of Mohanam for the kriti, &#8216;Narayanadivya Naamam.&#8217; His tara sthayi excursions in Behag while dealing RTP formed the euphoric part of the recital. Despite his gesticulations, the artist imparted lyrical intensity to all the items he dealt with. The tukkadas, towards the end, included &#8216;Ninnaye Gati,&#8217; &#8216;Brindavanam Iduvo&#8217; and &#8216;Kanda, Guha and Saravanabhava.&#8217; Though Nagai Muralidharan&#8217;s solo essays were delightfully soothing to match the vocalist&#8217;s fizz, yet he could have revealed his own skill in bowing. Easwaran (mridangam) and Mohanram (ghatam) proved their worth in the percussive wing.
