VA brisk &#8216;Sri Mahaganapathe' in Nattai was the first piece of D.B. Ashwin's afternoon concert. With a clear voice he developed Hindolam without rushing to reach the high point. Nishant Chandran on the violin was passable. The song to follow was &#8216;Maaramanan.' The swaraprasthara was made interesting with Ashwin dwelling on the signature note &#8216;ma'.A pleasant Kalavathi raga kriti of Tyagaraja &#8216;Okapari' was rendered neatly. The first half of the essay of the main item Kalyani had a very different approach which was very appealing and soothing. Nishant Chandran's effort in this raga was far better than the earlier one. Purandaradasa's &#8216;Nambikettavar Illavo' was taken up with niraval of &#8216;Garudagamana Sri' followed by nice combination of swaras.The thani by Aswin Sreedharan was lively. He also provided good support through the concert.
