VVijayalakshmi Chandrashekhar sang under the auspices of Nadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha, Mysore, accompanied by Thyagarajan (violin), C. Cheluvaraju (mridanga) and Dayananda Mohite (ghata).In her music, you find balanced economy, and therefore an aesthetic optimisation of all the elements of good music rules her perception and style. A resilient voice endowed with fine silvery timbre enjoys consistency in all the octaves.She materialises her imaginations on a scale that is natural to her, and hence facilitates fluent singing. Now, one can very well imagine the degree and magnitude of different moods that emanated from her presentations. As her accentuations were clear and the musical decorum refined, the compositions conveyed the full import of those lyrics as intended by the composers, subtle intonations rendering them canorous.Nevertheless, the overall style was pleasing and melodic more than inspiringly emotive.One more merit that governed the progressions was optimum speed, commensurate with the nature of the number on hand: whether a varna, kriti, dasarapada or a tillana.More details: Patnam's varna, &#8220;Sarasuda&#8221; in Saveri flashed positive indications with respect to all the merits enumerated above; and &#8220;Jaya Jaya Jaanaki&#8221; (Naata-Purandaradasa), &#8220;Shri Lakshmi Varaham&#8221; &#8220;Bhajeham&#8221; (Abhogi-Dikshithar), &#8220;Anupama Gunambudhi&#8221; (Athana-Thyagaraja) confirmed those observations.It was a joy to hear Kannada compositions receiving full-fledged genuine scholarly attention from this singer of musical modesty. &#8220;Jaya Jaya Jaanaki Kaanta&#8221; appended with passages of swarakalpana, &#8220;Enu Dhanyalo Lakumi&#8221; (Thodi-Purandaradasa) prefaced with a shloka (&#8220;Shri Lakshmim&#8221;) and meaningfully expatiated at the charana, &#8220;Sarvatradi Vyaptanaada&#8221;, did ample justice to the raga, the lyrics, and the essence of the compositions.Similar was the experience in Vasudevachar's &#8220;Ninne Nammithinayya&#8221; (Simhendra Madhyama). An elaborate evolvement of the raga (with dexterously executed tonic shift to bring in shades of Bhowli), fortified by subtle graces and variety of articulations led to the main body of the composition, the focus (the Lord) of which she imaginatively delineated (neraval) at the anupallavi, &#8220;Pannagendra Shayana&#8221;. Swaraprastara, once again was in conformity with the personality of Simhendra Madhyama and general import of the composition.Such an artistic whole characterised raga (Suryakantha &#8212; pleasant surprise) tana and pallavi (&#8220;Shankari Vashankari Sadgatim Dehi&#8221;).Ideally, the wise singer kept herself far from any superfluous mathematical exercises, and as a direct result, the pallavi was smooth, majestic and meaningful.Swarakalpana, with smooth transitions from one raga to another (Ranjani, Natakuranji, Jyotiswarupini and Revathi) was an index of the adept singer's intense sadhana. A tani avarthana at this stage of the concert opened opportunities for the learned percussionists to display their scholarship. The melody accompanist closely and gently followed mild and melodic disposition of the lead artiste throughout.The concert comprised Kabirdas' &#8220;Ramagovinda Hari Bhajore&#8221; (Purvi &#8211; the lyrics impressively carried the devotional element; however, she could have avoided taans, which failed to reflect her proficiency in that area convincingly), &#8220;Jagadhodharana&#8221; (Kaapi - Purandaradasa), &#8220;Tugidale Rangana&#8221; (Nilambari-Purandaradasa) and tillana (Brindavani-Balamuralikrishna).
