VB. RAMADEVIAdherence to tradition marked Gayathri Venkataraghavan's concert held at GKD Auditorium, organised by Alapana, Coimbatore.She commenced the programme with the Bhairavi varnam, `Viribhoni' and proceeded with the majestic `Gajananayutham Ganeshwaram' in Chakravaham by Dikshitar.Tyagaraja's `Seethapathe,' not oft-sung kriti, in Kamas was refreshing. Her delineation of Charukesi was very pleasing as she touched the varied depths and heights of the raga.She sang `Krupayaa Paalaya Showre' by Swathi Tirunal, another popular kriti of yesteryear in a leisurely manner, making the audience sink into the melody of her voice. This was followed by `Jamboopathe Maam Pahi,' one of the Panchalinga kritis of Dikshitar on Appulingam, in Yamuna Kalyani  in simple grandeur as the weighty sahitya, pregnant with meaning shone with dignity without any extra embellishment.Tyagaraja's `Sripathe' in Nagaswaravali  was brisk. After a lively alapana she presented `Marajananeem Ashraye' on Goddess Lakshmi in Natakapriya by H. S. Krishnamacharlu. `Koniadina Naa Pai,' the main piece was treated very elaborately.ImpressiveGayathri did not give much time for the lighter songs.`Poonguyil Koovum Poonjolaiyil Oru Naal' by Kalki Krishnamurthy in Hindustani Kapi and `Manathirkugandhadhu Murugan Roopam' by Thanjavur Sankara Iyer in Sindhu Bhairavi following the viruthams `Naalen Seyyum' and `Vizhikkuththunai' were very impressive and melodious.A few more `thukkadas' would have been welcome. She concluded her appealing concert with Papanasam Sivan's tillana and a Thiruppugazh.Akkarai Subbulakshmi gave excellent support to Gayathri and also proved her high calibre during the alapana and manodharmam.Melakkaveri K. Balaji and Adambakkam Shankar played the mridangam and ghatam respectively with joie de vivre and provided solid entertainment.Bottom Template Starts
