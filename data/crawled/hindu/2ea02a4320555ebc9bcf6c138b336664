VAt the Play Coop School, it was an overwhelming experience on a Sunday morning (August 24) to see so many gathered to experience the advent of Malhar. For some one as perfect as Shantanu Bhattacharya, in all aspects of Hindustani classical, it was th\u000ae complete identification of the man with his music in a raining melody that brought about the assimilation of sense, feeling and technique.For him it was a moment of truth, a confrontation with the inner integral self which was moulded by his guru mother and later by Pt. Prasun Banerjee, Meera Banerjee and Pt. Ajoy Chakravarthy; in a traditional Taalim in the Patiala Kasur Gharana.A research scholar at the ITC, Kolkata, Shantanu has had many milestones along the journey of self-discovery, having performed at the ITC Sangeet Sammelan, Kolkata and Delhi; Ustad Allaudin Khan Festival, Maiher; The Dover Lane Music Conference, Kolkata; at the the prestigious Ali Akbar College of music in California and at the renowned all night classical jazz festival at Helsinki.  His recital revived the spirit of freedom that enriches the music.Engrossed in his rendition, completely oblivious to the world, Shantanu, in his deep guttural voice, embellished Mian ki Malhar with long glides and a great throw. His gradual rise to reach the &#8216;sa&#8217; in the higher octave and sustain it for a very long time met with instant applause. The celebrated Mian Tansen&#8217;s composition &#8216;Sawan Aayo&#8217; in vilambit and &#8216;Sab rang piya tau chhaye&#8217; in dhrut were majestic verbal images enhancing and leaving indelible memories of Malhar.Shantanu&#8217;s execution of fast sargams and phrases, fast tans and boltaans were dressed to perfection and showed tremendous clarity of diction.This was followed by Meera bai ki Malhar &#8212; a unique combination of the Kannada and the Sarang Ang; vilambit in Jhoomra taal of fourteen beats and a piece in madhya laya &#8216;Balariya pyaari&#8217; with well defined &#8216;angs&#8217; of Darbari, Malhar and Sarang with long winding maends and the use of shud &#8216;ga&#8217; at places giving &#8216;ananda.&#8217; The movement into &#8216;Megh&#8217; in Zhaptaal &#8216;garje gatta kaare&#8217; was like the coming of the thunder.Small pieces spanning three octaves were taken with finesse and speed. &#8216;Garva barsan ko aaya,&#8217; Surdas&#8217;s Malhar, was yet another unusual composition giving real pleasure.A Thumri in Des Malhar in Dadra, &#8216;Panyia padu tore shaam&#8217; was equally delightful.  A short composition in Lalit was maends personified.  The  highlight of the morning was a thumri in Des &#8216;Sawan ki rut aayee re sajni Preetam ghar nahin aayo,&#8217; followed by a bhajan in Gaud Malhar &#8216;Barse badariya sawan ki.&#8217;The concert stood out for its purity and classicism.  Shantanu was accompanied on the tabla by Debashish. Durba, his wife, synchronised beautifully on the harmonium.
