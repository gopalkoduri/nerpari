VUnder the auspices of the Sri Ranga Vittala Bhajan Mandali, Sri Purandaradasar aradhana festival was organised at Sri Vyasarayar Mutt in Srirangam, coinciding with the &#8216;Thai Amavasai.&#8217;  Tribute was paid to Sri Purandaradasar, who is considered the  &#8216;Pithamaha&#8217; of Carnatic music. For, it was Sri Purandaradasar who introduced the simplest applications for learning music.His introduction of  Mayamalavagowla  for beginners as the practising music (abhyasa gaanam) was remembered by the speakers at the function.Explaining the sidelines of the function, a noted musician of Srirangam, Mythili Jagannathan, said that before the advent of Sri Purandaradasar, ragam Sankarabharanam  was chiefly adopted for teaching the fundamental components of music. But, it was  Purandaradasar who, realising the nuances of the music notes and its alignment brought about the use of &#8216;Mayamalavagowla.&#8217;&#8220;His methodology even synchronised with the principles of harmonium, thereby facilitating the beginners,&#8221; she said. She particularly referred to the seven &#8216;alankarams&#8217; of Sri Purandaradasar which adorn Carnatic music even now.As part of the celebrations, a vocal concert was presented by G. Anusha Bargavi and S. Sivasri. They presented an intelligent blend of the Dasar kritis which included &#8216;Narayana&#8217; in Suddhadhanyasi ragam, &#8216;Yadavaraya&#8217; and &#8216;Chandrachooda&#8217; both in Ragamalika and &#8216;Innudaya Bharathe&#8217; in Kalyanavasantham.  The pair mesmerised the audience through &#8216;Raghi Thanteendra&#8217; in Ahirbhairavi ragam.What surprised the audience was the kirtanas composed by a few other Dasars, who emulated the principles of Sri Purandaradasar.The kritis  &#8216;Kotta Bhagya&#8217; composed by Brauda Prasanna Dasar in Sindhubhairavi ragam indeed delighted the audience. They were accompanied by Ananda Rao on the harmonium and Venkataraman on the mridangam.
