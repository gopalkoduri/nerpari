VNeelakanta Sivan's devotion manifested itself in the poetry describing Lord Siva's joyous dance in celestial space; similarly O. S. Arun's Purvikalyani performed quite an &#8216;ananda natanam' on stage, its beauty shining in a riotous splash of notes.Belligerent and boisterous, unlike the orderly music of his illustrious brother, O. S. Thyagarajan, Arun's is marked by a big good-bye to structure, and indeed mellifluousness.But its charm lies in imagination &#8211; manodharma -- the singular hallmark of Carnatic music.Purvikalyani underscored this point. It was the &#8216;sub-main' piece of the concert and it was pleasing to see the vocalist get completely lost in his singing.Except for an occasional approbation of Kandadevi Vijayaraghavan's violin, Arun was oblivious of the world around him.&#8216;Ananda Natam Aaduvar' thundered down the hall with sumptuous swaras at the pallavi line, sometimes delivered one-by-one with illustrative jab of the index finger in the air! Purvikalyani was the best piece of the concert, better than the Malayamaruthum (Papanasanam Sivan's &#8216;Karpaga Manohara') that followed, and the Sankarabharanam (Tyagaraja's &#8216;Endhuku Peddala') that came after it.All through, the music -- whether it took the form of alapana, song or swaras -- came out like the thump of a drum, and not even the usually emollient Malayamaruthum was spared of its delectable loudness. In the niraval in the Sankarabharanam (at &#8216;Veda Sastra Tatwartha'), it was funny to see the artist do the mel-kalam earlier than the slower gait.Somewhere in-between, Arun sang a Koteeswara Iyer composition, &#8216;Singara Kumara,' with the distinct ring of the shut-sruthi daivatam, and announced to the flummoxed audience that it was raga Varunapriya -- the 24th Melakarta and the sudha madhyama counterpart of the better-known Neetimathi.The concert began with a Hamsadhwani piece in Tamil, &#8216;Ullam Irangi.'The charanam line begins with &#8216;Japa Thapa' and it would have been a treat if kalpana swaras had come at this point, rather than in the pallavi line. Kudandai Saravanan on the mridangam and Madipakkam Murali on the ghatam gave laudable percussive support.Brisk banterRANJANI HARIHARAN's Suddha Saveri showed class. Melakkaveri Thyagarajan accompanied her on the violin and his essay of the raga was a shade better than the vocalist's.Ranjani's music was imaginative, though tradition-bound. A nice alapana of the raga was followed by Tyagaraja's immortal composition, &#8216;Darini Telusu Konti.'The composition was delivered with due briskness that delighted the two percussionists &#8211; Manakkal Sairam (mridangam) and G. Ravichandran (ghatam).Earlier, Ranjani sang a soothing Purvikalyani and took up a rather rare composition&#8212;&#8216;Ninnu Vinagamari,' of Syama Sastri. Niraval and swaras occurred at the charanam line, &#8216;Paramalo.' The vocalist also sang &#8216;Harihara Sudhane Iyappa' (Abhogi) and &#8216;Asaindaadum Mayil Ondru' (Simhendra madhyamam of Oothukadu Venkatasubba Iyer), but without alapana or swaras.
