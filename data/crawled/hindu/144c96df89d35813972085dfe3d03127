Rafi, Vani Jayaram and Manna De had lent their voice for Oriya films. The mood of the enchanting evening was set by technocrat-turned-singer Biswaswaroop who presentedduniare samayara naibahijaereoriginally sung by Manna De for the film &#8216;Suryamukhi&#8217; during the black and white era. And now it was the turn of gifted singer Nazia Alam to move the audience to tears with Lata Mangeshkar&#8217;s Oriya film numberajimnu srabani luhara harini.As the songs were presented one after another by a set of promising singers with apt anchoring by singer Adyasha Das, the audience, hooked to their chairs, remained oblivious of time. The event was on for over three hours.The other singers who regaled were Sanghamitra, Swapnapriya, Soumya and also the anchor Adyasha.
