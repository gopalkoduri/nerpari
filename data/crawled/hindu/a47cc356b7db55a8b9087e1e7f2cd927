VThe number strength in the audience who came to attend the concert of Prema Rangarajan might have been modest, on the morning of January 2, but in terms of music appreciation it was quite impressive. All those present, including some not of Indian nationality, were quite intent as they listened to the artist taking off with &#8216;Erana pai,&#8217; varnam in Thodi, following it up with &#8216;Margazhi Thingal,&#8217; Tiruppavai, in raga Nattai, to suit the holy and festive ambience of the season. In the few manodharma swaras at &#8216;Narayanane,&#8217; Padma Sankar (violin), Melakaveri Balaji (mridangam) and Gurunathan (ghatam) blended well to reinforce the mood. The third item in Hamsanandi, with its departure into pratimadhyamam from the earlier suddhamadhyamam items, was a brisk one in Tamil, &#8216;Aadiya padatthai...&#8217; of Gopalakrishna Bharati, carrying a number of duritakala sahityams interspersed with the less swift paced one which again helped to spruce up the proceedings. A longer (quarter-hour) chapter followed marking the second phase in the recital with a well drawn out alapana in Arabi, identifiable from the opening stroke of &#8216;dha pa, pa magari&#8230;&#8217; and getting confirmed from &#8216;magarisanidha.&#8217;After an eight-minute tracing with full lakshanas, the singer let the violin take over. In proportionate duration, Padma followed a pattern blending well with the style. Syama Sastri&#8217;s composition in tisra triputa talam &#8216;Paalaya aashu maam, paradevate&#8217; is one that this listener does not recollect hearing before, and was engrossing for both its musical and lyrical content. Prema chose the lines &#8216;Kama koti peetha suvaasini&#8217; for niraval and kalpanaswaras and delivered them pleasingly. With the joint effort of the violin it was a fulfilling experience.It was during the passage in raga Nayaki (&#8216;Nee bhajana gana rasikula&#8217; of Tyagaraja) that one got the feeling that the singer&#8217;s voice was getting drowned by both percussion instruments. It was becoming hard to distinguish not only the sahityam but also the tune at times. The lead number of the programme was Kalyani. In a brilliant painting of the raga, the singer moved her sancharas to the higher parts of the scale, and dwelt mostly there to prepare the environment for receiving the chosen composition.With Padma taking up the cue and also hovering more on the higher notes till she concluded her essay, the ground was well set for Subbaraya Sastri&#8217;s composition &#8216;Ninnuvina gati ganana&#8217; set in its madhyamakala Adi talam, with predominantly &#8216;tara sthayi sanchara.&#8217; With kalpanaswaras at &#8216;vinuta palini.&#8217; Shifting to the tisra gati while executing korvais in tisram, khandam and misram to end the swara korvais at &#8216;Ni&#8217; with one, two and three preceding swaras over a few avartanams, and Padma tuning immediately into the pattern, was delightful to the listener. The twenty-minute thani avartanam following this was competently pulled off by Balaji and Gurunathan. Neelambari, Bhupalam and a Thillana in Mohanam brought the concert to a finish.Much of the beautiful lyrics  in the various items presented, though rendered melodiously and with power, was unfortunately lost in the overwhelming sound of the mridangam. This may well be attributed to disproportionate amplification, but there were numerous occasions when the two percussionists went on a spree in their own enthusiasm. It would be so pleasant if only the percussionist were to see his role in the proper perspective, that is as an instrument for augmenting and embellishing the effort of the main artist aesthetically, while accompanying, and for demonstration of his originality, erudition and skill while on the thani.During the charanam of the Kalyani item, to quote one instance, one could barely identify the words which came after &#8216;pada pankaja mulanu&#8217; unless one knew the kriti. The two percussionists were on their own trip, totally oblivious to the fact that the other two artists were struggling to get heard above the din. Musical sensitivity should reign supreme at all times.
