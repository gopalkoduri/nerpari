VTOOMU VENKATA Ramakrishna, popularly known as Krishna Sri, belongs to the family of the well-known saint-poet Toomu Narasimhadasu who wrote umpteen compositions, like Ramadasu did on Bhadrachala Srirama.Ramakrishna, who's also a journalist is a good lyric writer obviouslyinfluenced by his ancestor Narasimha Dasu.  Being a devotee of Bhadrachala Srirama, he has been penning devotionals on Lord Srirama of Bhadrachalam.He now ventured, with the help of his friends and  devotees, to produce audiocassette of nine chosen devotionals on Srirama, which he calls nine gems he offers to the Lord, this way.The cassette is titled as `Bhadradri Ramudu' thatwas released last week at Sri Thyagaraya Ganasabha as part of `Vasanta Navaratri' Festival, marking Srirama Navami season. The Pallavi and the first `charanam' of the opening lyric were rendered as a mark of inauguration.Noted singers of the twin cities Parthasarathi, Krishna Prasad, Suresh Balu, Surekha Murthy and Geeta Rani rendered these nine songs displaying sense for `sahitya' expression and their musical appeal. Ramacharana Dasu, set them to tune .Popular flautist J. Duttatreya lent  orchestral support. Chandrasekhara Sastry said these songs would sure add to the devotional atmosphere when played in temples and at other devotional events. Ramakrishna was felicitated on the occasion.The programme was preceded by other events of the Vasantotsavam like recitation of Vishnusahasranama by Viswasai group, Sarvamata Prayer and rendition of `Sundarakaanda' by P Srinivas, grandson of the late M.S. Rama Rao, the original composer and singer in lyrical form. .G.S.Bottom Template Starts
