VB. RAMA DEVIWhile children need coaxing and cajoling to have them do their routine,  `Abaswaram' Ramjhi seems to have done a miracle by making  children sing like adults. He presented `Isai Mazhalai', a musical extravaganza, at the Nani Palkhiwala Auditorium, Coimbatore, in aid of Rotary Coimbatore Spectrum's community service projects. The eleven singers in his troupe, between six and fourteen, thrilled the audience with an assortment of film songs spread across fifty years, from `O...  Rasika Seemaane' from ``Parasakthi" to the latest hit from ``Anniyan," `Ayyangar veettu azhagae.'In the course of his chatty compering, Ramjhi fondly remembered the launching of `Isai Mazhalai' five years ago at the Music Academy, Chennai.Rohini and Ajish Ashok commenced the programme with their spirited song `Uyirin uyirey' from ``Kaakka Kaakka." Then Sai Charan sang `Oru naal podhumaa' from ``Thiruvilaiyaadal" after a breathtaking alapana. It is a very difficult song and originally sung by none less than the giant Balamurali Krishna, but Sai Charan sailed through from Thodi to Darbar to Mohanam to Kanada.`Devuda devuda', `Kokku para para' and `Raa raa' from ``Chandramukhi" were received with applause. However, it was a little awkward to hear young children sing some of the obscene lyrics, although Ramjhi himself was critical of the words.The one who impressed most was `Paravai Muniamma' (Sanjana, called so because of her voice like Paravai Muniamma and small stature) with her `Madura veeran thaaney' from Dhool.With her twinkling eyes, smiling lips, dancing feet and, of course, a rich voice, she gave clear indications that she is sure to become a great entertainer in the future.Vikram also stole the show with his konnakkol for the songBottom Template Starts
