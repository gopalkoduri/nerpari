VYoung vocalist Priyanka C. Prakash,\u000aaccompanied by M.P. Aditya\u000a(violin), and Phanindra\u000aBhaskar (mridanga), performed\u000aat the Venugopalaswami Temple,\u000aBangalore, on Friday.While "Tathvamariyatharama" in\u000aReethigoula, "Kshanameva" in Bhupalam\u000aand "Narayana" in Shuddha\u000aDhanyasi set the concert on a course\u000aof patent classicism, aided by a powerful\u000avoice and promising talent, the\u000aalapana of Panthuvarali, and the neraval\u000aand kalpana swaras appended to\u000athe Thyagaraja krithi "Raghuvara" in\u000aaditala, bore testimony to rigorous\u000atraining. "Yelara Krishna" in Kamboji\u000awas followed by "Unnaiyallal" in Kalyani\u000araga and aditala, including an\u000aexpressive neraval and kalpana swaras\u000aat "Neeye Meenakshi", and a crisp\u000aand clear rendition of Oothukkadu\u000aVenkatasubbaier's "Neeradasama" in\u000aJayanthasri.The alapana of Todi, the main raga,\u000arevealed good voice control in the\u000along rests at the madhyama, panchama\u000aand shadja, in the effortless progression\u000ato the tara sthayi madhyama\u000aand panchama, and in the fast bhrigaoriented\u000apassages. Exclusive usage of\u000aa clean akara, instead of some other\u000avowels employed, would however\u000ahave enhanced the impact of the teenaged\u000aartiste's style. "Srikrishnam\u000aBhaja Manasa", sung at an invigorating\u000apace with clear diction, was supplemented\u000awith neraval and kalpana\u000aswaras at "Shankha Chakra", executed\u000awith commendable proficiency\u000aand ‚lan, and notwithstanding an occasional\u000afluctuation in tempo, indicative\u000aof inherent potential.The concert, augmented by melodious\u000aaccompaniment from the\u000ayoung violinist and expert support\u000afrom the percussionist, concluded\u000awith the sloka "Shanthakaram" set to\u000aan appealing Varali, Bilahari and Darbari\u000aKanada, the Meera Bhajan "Hari\u000aTum Haro" and a tillana in Khamas.The Sri Thyagaraja Gana Sabha Trust\u000ahosted a vocal concert on Sunday by\u000aKalavathy Avadhoot, accompanied by\u000aB. Raghuram (violin), B.C. Manjunath\u000a(mridanga), and S. Shrishylan (ghata).The concert, an example of steadfast\u000aadherence to tradition and technical\u000aprowess camouflaged in soft and\u000amelodious felicity of expression, began\u000awith "Samidayajuda", Thiruvottiyur\u000aThyagaier's adi thala varna in\u000aKedaragoula, and progressed with\u000a"Jayajayajaya Janakikantha" in Natta\u000araga and khanda chapu thala, embellished\u000awith a few kalpana swaras. The\u000aDikshitar krithi "Sadachaleswaram"\u000ain Bhupalam was also supplemented\u000awith kalpana swaras, while the\u000aThyagaraja krithi in Madhyamavathi,\u000a"Vinayakuni" set to adi tala was prefixed\u000awith an alapana and featured a\u000aneraval but no kalpana swaras. Dikshitar's\u000a"Ehi Annapoorne" in Punnagavarali\u000ain adi tala, with its heavy gamaka\u000aoriented structure, was a rare and delectable\u000achoice.The Poorvikalyani suite, the main\u000aitem of the concert, comprised a detailed\u000aalapana, "Meenakshi Me Mudam\u000aDehi", the majestic Dikshitar\u000acomposition in aditala, neraval at\u000a"Madhurapuri Nilaye", and a spate of\u000akalpana swaras that attested to the\u000aartiste's consummate command over\u000alaya, ending with an excellent tani\u000aavarthana incorporating absorbing\u000apermutations and combinations.The artiste's exposition of Behag in\u000athe ugabhoga and the ensuing devaranama\u000aby Purandaradasa highlighted\u000athe scintillating allure of the raga\u000ain a variety of sancharas that traversed\u000athe scale up to the tara sthayi panchama\u000awith ease."Sarvam Brahmamayam" in Darbari\u000aKanada, and a bhajan in Yaman\u000aKalyan, both of which were soulful\u000arenditions emphasising both sahitya\u000abhava and raga bhava, brought the\u000aconcert to a close.
