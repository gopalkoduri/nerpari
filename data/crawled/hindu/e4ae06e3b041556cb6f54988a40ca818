VFresh from participating in a five-week programme of &#8216;Artists in Residence,' Umayalpuram Mali speaks about his experience at the Harvard University's Music Department.Disciple of Guru Kumbakonam Rajappa Iyer and maestro Umayalpuram Sivaraman, Mali was earlier chosen for a five-month long programme for young achievers from diverse fields, through Copeland Fellowship awarded by Amherst College, Massachusetts, in 2006.Mali worked with Richard Wolf, Professor of Music, Harvard University. Wolf is a vina player, disciple of Ranganayaki Rajagopalan.Apart from coordinating his basic rhythms, Mali took up coaching for many of the students who had registered with him, for learning mridangam.Memorable momentsMali recalls an interesting episode. &#8220;Mr. Noam Hassan, a drum player, had requested Prof. Wolf to permit him to play solo, that is, Thani Avartanam, for just three minutes on the last day of my stay there. I was also curious to know how he would fare in the &#8216;test' because I had taught him only for four weeks during my stay at Harvard. However, being a drum player, he could adapt the rhythm in mridangam with his experience and played solo for three minutes, to my delight.&#8221;Mali digresses to mention how a couple of years ago, Perumal, a porter at the Egmore railway station hesitantly approached him with a request to teach him to play the mridangam so that he could accompany bhajan groups. Mali took him under his wings and taught him and presented him a mridangam, too, for his dedication.Lecture-demonstrations were a routine on week-ends. Mostly consisting of Indian students, the programmes were presented under &#8216;Harvard Sangeeth.' The presentations were followed by open house.Accompanying Wolf, who played the veena was an unusual experience, recollects Mali.The audience was a mixed crowd of Indians and other nationals. Throughout, they sat in complete silence and listened in rapt attention.The annual meeting of the Northeast Chapter of the Society for Ethnomusicology was an interesting experience, according to Mali. It was held at the Fanny Peabody Mason Music Building in Harvard University's Music Department. Over a score of papers were presented in different rooms, the sessions chaired by experts, from 9 a.m. till 4 p.m. and the vina concert was held from 4 to 5.30.&#8220;A few papers were quite interesting for their sheer content,&#8221; observes Mali. One was &#8216;Who do you think you are, a Rockstar or something?' This paper described the experiences of three Portland-based freelance musicians whose work crosses the divide between Western classical music and &#8216;popular' music.Made an impactAnother paper that made an impact on Mali was &#8216;I am a Seed of Peace: Music and Israeli-Arab Peacemaking' by Micah Hendler of Yale University.The details of the concert that Wolf presented were printed in a pamphlet and handed to the audience before they entered the hall. The list of kritis was provided with the composers' names in the opening page. The history of Carnatic music was mentioned in brief, on &#8216;Programme Notes,' besides short sketches on the vina, mridangam and tambura.Brief notes on the kritis and their core meaning were also provided. For instance, the main piece, &#8216;Minakshi memudam' was explained thus: &#8220;This is the &#8216;main item' in the performance. The composition is preceded by two forms of improvisation: raga alapana, an unmetered exploration of the raga, and tanam, a form of improvisation with a steady pulse. Tanam, articulated by patterns of alternating strummed and plucked notes, is particularly well suited to the vina. Following the composition, Wolf plays swara kalpana; this returns to the melody of the third section, or charanam, which begins one-half count after the first clap of the tala. This is followed by a drum solo by Sri Mali.&#8221;Mali acknowledges that Prof. Wolf and the Harvard University gave him this rare opportunity and that he benefited immensely during his interactions with the students.
