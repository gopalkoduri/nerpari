VGARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMNityasri Mahadevan is back with a bang after having kept out of action in the previous two music seasons. Her full-throated singing with some refreshing pieces proclaimed her return. The packed house at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan on Saturday last was perhaps an acknowledgement of the come-back performance.Many of her fans would have been naturally pleased with the way Nityasri sang `Bantureetikoluvu' and, `Dorakuna ituvantiseva,' the centre piece of the evening. The neraval and kalpanaswaram in these compositions, besides the alapana of ragam Bilahari showcased mastery over the voice and fluency of expression, known qualities of Nityasri.Respite from routineThe other noteworthy feature of the recital was the respite from routine kutcheri ragas &#151;  Kharaharapriya, Thodi or Bhairavi. Beginning with Patnam Subramanya Iyar's varnam in Kedaragowla, Annamacharya's `Mangambudi hanumanta,' in Dharmavati was the major composition in a long sequence of not so common kritis that Nityasri presented. `Vidalaguma velayya,' by Kallidaikurichi Sankaranarayana Iyar in Devagandhari was charged with emotion. But `Muruganai kana kannayiram vendum,' (Karnataka Devagandari) was very special as it embodies a Muslim composer Arulavan's devotion to the Hindu deity lord Murugan.  Then came the Ramalinga Swami arutpa in viruttam in ragas Neelambari, Saveri, Hamsanandi and Sindhubhairavi followed by the Gopalakrishna Bharati song ``Tha..thai... endraduvar'.Dr R.Hemalatha was truly outstanding on the violin, especially in her essay of Bilahari. I. Sivakumar on the mridangam and Malaikkottai Deenadayalu on the morsing presented a highly entertaining percussion solo. Nityasri will carry on through the rest of the season with at least  10 more concerts.Bottom Template Starts
