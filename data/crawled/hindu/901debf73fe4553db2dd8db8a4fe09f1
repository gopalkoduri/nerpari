VChitra Bilvam sang under the auspices of Ganabharathi. The senior artiste paying the desired attention to the emotive aspects rendered her concert pleasing and ideal.Meticulously honed voice reached all the required pitches with considerable ease, and it was especially clear retaining its timbre in the lower octaves. The general pace she had opted fairly facilitated her expressions while she was placing the lyrical contents before the audience.Nevertheless, some presentations would have shone with greater verve had she increased the general pace marginally or had she increased the duration of the embellishments set to moderate speeds. In this respect, consider the focus of the recital, &#8220;Rama Niyeda&#8221; (Karaharapriya-Thyagaraja), which provided ample scope for detailed interpretation and discussion.The singer was quick in exposing the essence of Karaharapriya, while she could have made it more melodious and pleasing with simple articulations. She was not fluent, and lacked imagination. On the other hand, the lyrical sections conveyed the element of Bhakthi commanding unreserved appreciations.The neraval at &#8220;Thana Soukhyamu&#8221; (Charana) was musically potent and meaningfully eloquent in drawing the attention of every serious listener. Her involvement while expanding the selected strain made considerable difference in elevating the overall mood.It was in the swaraprastara section that some of the passages suffered with similarly sounding phrases and relatively protracted extempore in slow paces.Both from the emotive and imaginative aspects &#8220;Ni Samanamevaru&#8221; (Shubhapantuvarali - GNB) contrasted with the above number. A slow to medium tempo remarkably favoured a pleasing expatiation of the raga and meaningful delineation of the kriti as well. Considering the extent of the alapana, one naturally wished for a few passages of swarakalpana for a better balance.In every respect, the young violinist's (Vithala Rangan) curves substantiated artistry mature and fertile, gentle and relevant. He would anticipate the lead artiste extempore beforehand and keep himself in readiness to complement her fully. The percussionist P.S. Shridhar (mridanga) in addition to an appropriate rhythm-support proved his versatility in the tani avarthana, in his individual capacity.Other compositions included Muthayya Bhagavathar's &#8220;Maathe Malayadhvaja&#8221; (Daru &#8211; Khamach), Thulasivanam's &#8220;Bhajamaanasa&#8221; (Bahudari - with short and crisp alapana), Rajagopalachari's &#8220;Kurai Onrum&#8221; (Ragamalika), Periyasami Tooran's &#8220;Muralidhara Gopala&#8221; (Maand) and so on.
