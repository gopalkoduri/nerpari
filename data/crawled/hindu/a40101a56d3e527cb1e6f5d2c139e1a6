VThe week-long Carnatic music fest took of to a damp start and continued to be bleak despite creditable concerts by stalwarts like T.R. Shankaranarayanan, Sanjay Subramaniam and Unni Krishnan, not to talk of the television star Neyveli Santana Gopalan. Nada Tarangam Trust which organised this as part of its second anniversary celebrations should have taken care to see that the word reached the music lovers of twin cities. The half empty auditorium of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan was more demeaning to the singers of repute who were invited from Tamil Nadu than to the public in general.Instrumental music was confined to just veena by high calibre local artiste D. Srinivas and the inimitable U. P. Raju who could create magic on the mandolin along with Nagamani. Despite the lukewarm response, the dedicated vocalists gave their best in terms of quality. All of them chose rare compositions of known ragas or not so common ragas too at times to delight the connoisseur who would at any cost make it to the recital.Shankaranarayan was a delight to watch and savour. The ease with which he laced his lyrics with brief to elaborate rendition of the swaram was amazing. Whether in the tara or in the lower octave, his rich voice vibrated with a depth that&#8217;s hard to gauge. Added to this, the vocalist regaled his listeners with choicest kritis- likeninu vinain Hamsadhwani,Sri Saraswati namosthuthein Arabhi a Dikshitar composition where the&#8216;mitram&#8217;was given a wonderful treatment. Be it his neraval or sangathis or the most intrinsic swara kalpana, Shankaranarayan&#8217;s improvisations are not only individualistic but rendered with an effortless that few musicians are capable of. For instance the neraval for the refrain&#8216;hithavu matalentho baaga balkitiv.&#8217;was a creative wonder. His mastery over the medium is superb going by the Kapi Narayani &#8211;Sarasasa madana&#8230; and theVasudeva&#8230;in Kalyani. He endowed the Kalyani with an extra beauty that could not be missed.Talking of the raga, Sanjay Subramaniam also chose Kalyani to extol the goddess throughNinu vina gati gaana &#8230;. The lyrical beauty of the kriti was embellished with the Sanjay touch. The way he allowed his voice to soar over the line-vinutha paalini&#8230; was enough to stir a wave of emotion in the listeners. The chitta swaram and the stylistic interpretation of swara kalpana wrought with syllabic variations through the octaves was mind blowing. The vocalist&#8217;s voice is his biggest asset- sonorous, emotive and firm. The Kedaragowla varnam &#8211;Swami ninney nammi ..which were his opening notes gave us a glimpse of the expertise.Kripa choochutaku vela ra Raama&#8230;in Chaya Tarangini was outright lyric rendition with a sprinkling of sangathees whileYetula brothuvo teliyaka ekanta Ramaiahin Chakravakam was embellished with an alapana before it was presented in all its chiselled finery. The artiste, initially disturbed by the bad acoustics took time to settle down to his melodic best by the time he reached Chakravakam. Arun Prakash on the mridangam and Varadarajan S. on the violin made for a fitting orchestra.It was slightly heartening to note that Unnikrishan&#8217;s charisma brought in more number of music lovers on the closing day of the festival. His style makes for sliding lyrics, stylish gamakam and swaram. If you would want to decipher the song, well there is no chance. His swarakalpana affords more clarity of syllables than his verse rendition per se. The Varali-Seshachala naaga&#8230;allowed a free flow of lyric along with superb neraval. The other compositions were more technical displays of speed and syllabic gymnastics rather than an attempt to reach the audience. L.V.V. Iyer on the mridangam, Nemani Somayajulu on the ghatam and Peri Sriramamurthy on the violin were average.
