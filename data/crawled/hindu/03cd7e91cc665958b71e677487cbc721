VThe week-long celebration of M.S. Subbulakshmi's birthday in Madurai, organised by the INTACH chapter, is a much awaited annual event. This year too was no different with plenty of variety on offer.It began with a wonderfully synchronised jugalbandi by T.M. Krishna and Sangeetha Sivakumar. The couple began with the dharu varnam &#8216;Mathe' in Khamas. Krishna sang with easy grace at a lower pitch to match Sangeetha's voice, while she made an energetic attempt to match his pitch, resulting in a harmonious blend of voices. The chittaswarams, in particular, were a testimony to the success of their presentation. Following &#8216;Sri Ganapathini Sevimparadha' in Sowrashtra, Krishna spoke of how vocalists of the past sang some kritis repeatedly, and made them their own. M.S. sang the ragas Vachaspati, Pantuvarali and Sankarabharanam quite often.Krishna then sang the alapana in Vachaspati and Sangeetha sang &#8216;Paratpara' by Papanasam Sivan. Niraval was done on the phrases &#8216;Ariayanum' and kalpanaswaras were strung around it. Krishna said that M.S. learnt from the best teachers. As she had learnt the Khambodi kriti &#8216;O Rangasayee' from both Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and Musiri Subramanya Iyer, she combined the styles without any one sangati sounding obtrusive. Another unique attempt was the reproduction of the M.S-GNB duet &#8216;Premayil Yavum Marandhome' by the singers.Anita Ratnam began her dance recital with kautuvam which is an invocation to Goddess Saraswathi. This piece was composed by Revathi Sankaran and sung to the beat of Western drums interspersed with jatis of Kittappa Pillai. The overall effect was novel and pleasant.As the keyboard gave out bird sounds, Anita appeared with a jewelled plait, a prop that she used to depict several things. It was sometimes used to depict the trunk of an elephant, sometimes a crown, a broom, a garland, a lotus and even a swing as she danced for &#8216;Ksheerapthi Kanyakaku.' Her portrayal of Goddess Meenakshi as a warrior was inspired by Rukmini Devi, who used kalari in her dance in as early as 1952. The piece, &#8216;Saroja Dalanetri' won nods of approval from the rasikas for its graceful movements and poses. Anita then tried to capture the spirit of carefree joy in &#8216;Anandamen Solveno.' Her imitation of the histrionics of the female and male leads from old movies added to the overall effect.The Musiri stampThe last concert was by Anusha Pradeep, the great granddaughter of Musiri. She chose pieces taught by him to M.S. Right from the first varnam, &#8216;Eranaapai' in Thodi, the rendering bore the Musiri signature.The singer extolled the bhava of devotion that Musiri was able to express in &#8216;Brovamma' in Maanji. &#8216;Thiruvadi Charanam' in Khambodi was followed by the Tiruppugazh, &#8216;Charana Kamalalayathil' in Chenjurutti.
