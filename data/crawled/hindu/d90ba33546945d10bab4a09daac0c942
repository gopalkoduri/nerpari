VThe Department of Culture, Government of Andhra Pradesh, came up with a  novel idea of welcoming the monsoons with a series ofragasassociated with the season  believed to hasten the rainfall, if there was a delay.According to legends, Deekshitar, one among the musical trinity, was going to Ettayapuram. He saw people suffering from drought. On their request he prayed to the rain goddess Amriteswari, chantingSalilam Varshaya, Varshaya, Varshaya, following which there was a downpour. Fearing that the area might be drowned, he replaced that lyrics withSthambhaya, Sthambhaya, Sthambhaya. And lo! The rain stopped. This incident was recorded in the bookSangeeta Sampradaya Pradarshiniwritten in 1919 by Subbarama Deekshtulu, his grandson.Noted artistes  took part in the concert that was held at Ravindra Bharati, which began with Puranam Purushothama Sastry'sAmrutha Varshiniand ended with Nookala Chinna Satyanarayana'sslokainragamalikaof all these fourragas-- he took up for aslokamand sang each line in each of theseragasand then concluded withHarapriyaforRama nee samana. Most of the musicians rendered more or less two compositions each. And the most commonragawasAmrutha Varshini.Accompanying musicians included clarinet player Achibabu, veena artistes D. Srinivas, Duddu Sitaramayya and Ayyagari Somasundar, Nagaraj on flute, vocalists Seshadri (Varuna Priya), P. Seshayya Sastry, Seshulatha, Hyderabad Brothers - Raghava Chari and Seshachari, vocalist duo Aruna and Padma, violinists Sarada Chalam, Anil Kolanka and Dwaram, mridangists P. Srinivasa Gopalan, Pulletikurthi Venkata Ramana and P.R.C. Sarma and others .
