VFinger tips intensely sensitive to sweet sound, melodic meettu and finesse in fluency confirmed the high quality of Revathy Krishna&#8217;s veena recital for the Fifty-Fifty Club. Fertile manodharma wrapped up the three endowments in the raga alapanas. What made the kutcheri remarkable was the way she enriched the ragas and songs taking them beyond just interpretative discipline. It was her commitment to provide the best of Carnatic music.Revathy played three raga alapanas &#8212; Mohana Kalyani, Latangi and Khambodi &#8212; with clear indication of her discernment of their beauty and grace. In phrasings and pace there was charming consistency and the beauteous sancharas spoke of the good aspects of her playing techniques. There were resplendent flashes to brighten them.Mohana Kalyani (&#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam&#8217;) caught the melodic niceties and nuances in its lilting course guided by sound instincts. This item and the Jaganmohini piece &#8216;Sobillu Sapta Swara&#8217; at the start laid a healthy rhythm for the rest of the concert. Both the songs served as an inspirational journey to the more solid and versatile part of the performance.That veena play is more than skilled fingering and meettu manipulation was to be sensed in her presentation of the Vagadeeswari kirtana &#8216;Paramaatmudu.&#8217; As it progressed its serene sentiment was explicit. There was overwhelming aesthetic touches in its unfolding.The gamaka oscillations in the alapana picture of Latangi (&#8216;Marivere Dikkevvaru&#8217;) were focussed on its distinctive shades. Competence stemmed from the compositional quality of the vinyasa. The sancharas, rich in content, were subtly integrated with gracious articulation. The layers of progressive phrasings compelled attention. The rendering pattern of the kirtana was meant to convey its perpetual joyful structuring.The raga of the evening was Khambodi (&#8216;Oh! Rangasayee&#8217;). The appeal of the exposition was savoured all the way because of its scintillating movement. There were no exhibitionistic tendencies, but only exquisiteness and enchantment. Hearing through the unfolding of the raga the rasikas&#8217; response was enjoyably activated. The charm lay in the way Revathy gathered clusters of rakti-based sancharas. There was compelling profundity in the simple but enlightening Khambodi.As regards the song, Revathy delved into the peaks and poise of the composition. Whoever plays or sings &#8216;O! Rangasayee,&#8217; he or she will be reminded of the sterling values of Carnatic music. Revathy did full justice to this aspect especially the anupallavi &#8216;Saranga Darudu&#8217; and the charanam line &#8216;Bhooloka Vaikuntam.&#8217; The overall impression of this item was the blending of sampradaya and Revathy&#8217;s creativity in weaving a web of pleasing fluency, an indication of the exactness of her professionalism. She also played a rare Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Naayeda Vanchana Seyakura&#8217; in Nabomani.The percussion accompanists in a veena recital have to necessarily  be in low key. Trivandrum R. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and Tiruchi Murali (ghatam) observed this restraint well. Manikandan (keyboard) had an insignificant role.
