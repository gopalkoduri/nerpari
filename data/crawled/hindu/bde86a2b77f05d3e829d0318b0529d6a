V&#8230;it was with &#8216;Hotel California&#8217; that The Eagles established themselves as superstars.The American band that&#8217;s synonymous with classics such as &#8216;Hotel California&#8217; and &#8216;Hell Freezes Over,&#8217; made a huge impact in the 1970s, writing mostly rock ballads that had a country feel.&#8216;Life In the Fast Lane&#8217; in America at that time caught the band&#8217;s imagination and many of their songs reflected a time when there was rapid change in the way people thought and behaved. In fact, during their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, they were described as a band whose &#8220;favourite subject matter was the pursuit and unravelling of the American dream.&#8221;The band that now comprises songwriters and founding members guitarist Glenn Frey and drummer Don Henley, bassist Timothy B. Schmit and guitarist Joe Walsh, came to prominence when it released a self-titled album with oh-so-popular &#8216;Take It Easy&#8217; and &#8216;Witchy Woman.&#8217; Then came &#8216;Desperado&#8217; with &#8216;Tequila Sunrise&#8217; at its high point.But it was with &#8216;Hotel California&#8217; that The Eagles established themselves as superstars. Even though they came up with &#8216;The Long Run&#8217; later on, the cracks had begun to widen and the split happened.In that context, &#8216;Long Road Out Of Eden&#8217; is truly significant. The double album that boasts 20 tracks has the inimitable Eagles stamp of music. Simple harmonies that speak of everything from politics and poetry to human emotions, sometimes strong and other times, frail. Stirs up some nostalgia in the listener. Take the songs themselves.The opening track, &#8216;No More Walks in the Woods&#8217; has sombre A Capella harmonies (without any accompaniments) with lyrics that talk of environmental change.The party begins with the second track, the familiar country rock sound in &#8216;How Long.&#8217; The song was written by J. D. Souther and actually recorded in the 1970s but never used.The title track is a 10-minute long lament on the state of a nation and a wry comment on the U.S-Iraq imbroglio. The guitar riffs jell effortlessly with the piano notes complementing the melancholic vocals of Henley.Another typical Eagles song, this! &#8216;I Love to Watch a Woman Dance&#8217; has that soft romantic feel. As for the rest, listen to them. It&#8217;s worth the while.Henley said in an interview, &#8220;This is probably the last Eagles&#8217; album.&#8221; This may not be good news for Eagles fans. But don&#8217;t lose hope as the band is supposed to get together once again this year.  Maybe something will come up then! Till then, it&#8217;s time to sit back and enjoy the smooth melodies of the new album.
