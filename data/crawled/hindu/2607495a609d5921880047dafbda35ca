VP. SURYA RAOThe Dasara Music Festival organised by the State Department of Culture at G.V.R. Government College of Music and Dance in the spacious auditorium Gokaraju Laila Gangaraju Kala Vedika was not a success as far as the audience attendance is concerned. However the quality of the three concerts was high.

B.V.Durgabhavani, Mandapaka Nagalakshmi and S.Hanumanta Rao gave fine support to Seshaiah Sastri on violin, mridangam and ghatam respectively.A melodious concert by Dr.Mandapaka Sarada of Visakhapatnam was featured on the second day.
