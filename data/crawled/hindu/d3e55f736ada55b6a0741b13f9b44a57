VIt was Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer day at the Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha. Palai Ramachandran was the performer. &#8216;Pankaja Lochana&#8217; (Kalyani), &#8216;Ksheenamai&#8217; (Mukhari) and &#8216;Sri Krishnam Bhaja Manasa&#8217; (Thodi) were the main items.The concert was tempo-drenched from the start. In every phrase in alapana, in every sangati in kritis and in every bar of swara his guru&#8217;s stamp was well affixed.The delineation of the ragas, Kalyani and Thodi, brought out  his fidelity to the Semmangudi image. With heightened tonal thrust Ramachandran  consciously tapped the core of his guru&#8217;s bhani.Palai Ramachandran covered the entire solid ground of Kalyani with emphatic statements to convey the patterned depth of the raga. Comparatively, his  Thodi version was smooth and easy flowing.  The gentle twists and turns in the alapana conveyed that delicacy in expression is more eloquent than assertive rhetoric.The Kalyani and Mukhari kirtanas were handled in the same robust mood. The sangatis in &#8216;Pankaja Lochana&#8217; and &#8216;Ksheenamai&#8217; reflected his deep-seated rhetorical impulses. Besides the three songs he sang &#8212; &#8216;Merusamana&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla) &#8216;Nee Bhajanagana&#8217; (Nayaki) &#8216;Gaja Vadana&#8217; (Sriranjani) &#8212; the choice of the items revealed his good sense in framing the kutcheri. The patantara suddha of the kritis served as strong foundation to his concert technique and to his sense of competence. If his performing passion is tempered with softness of tonal modulation, the effort would be more appealing.V.V. Ravi on the violin, in his solo versions of Kalyani and Thodi, marked his play with well-composed lyrical sancharas. The alapanas brought out Ravi&#8217;s involved closeness to artistry. He conveyed his creativity through gentle tone.The percussionists were Madirimangalam Swaminathan (mridangam) and Vaikom Gopalakrishnan (ghatam). Their capacity to produce firm rhythm answered to the vocalist&#8217;s preference for penetrating power.
