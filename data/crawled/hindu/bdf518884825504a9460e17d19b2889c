VThe strong support lent by a spirited young team of accompanists comprising Nagai Sriram (violin), J. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and Alathur Raja Ganesh came as an added fillip. Vaidyanathan&#8217;s strokes were calm and controlled, directing the tani with poise, as Raja Ganesh on the kanjira matched skill with  excellence that shone through tone and resonance.&#8216;Jaya Jaya Padmanabha Murare&#8217; (Sarasangi, Swati Tirunal) supported the neraval festooned with  flourishes and swaraprasthara that drew strength from sarvalaghu and apt poruttams.The Varamu delineation (&#8216;Thunai Purindharul,&#8217; Papanasam Sivan) was high in aesthetic content, its value further enhanced by the violinist&#8217;s contribution. &#8216;Venkata Saila&#8217; (Subbaraya Sastri, HamirKalyani) flowed deep and steady, directing the mind to tranquillity.Thodi emerged as an alapana of substance. While the pace of delivery of prayogas tended towards rapid fire, the intelligent manoeuvring of sancharas spoke of much preparation, time and thought in  passages at the nishadha and the tara sthayi rishabha and gandhara. The raga was structured with purpose and direction and the vocalist pulled off adventurous coups with assurance. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Kaddanu Vaariki&#8217; was rendered with deliberation.The niraval was spun in detail, kalpanaswaras flowed in brisk rounds, and the kuraippu centred at the shadja was executed with finesse.Whether negotiating convoluted loops, shooting star trajectories or swaroopa-sculpting gamakas, Nagai Sriram (violin) was in his elements, engaging the listener with a combination of unerring instinct and intensity , particularly in the Thodi alapana.
