VThe myriad manifestations of Lord Krishna, his amorous adventures, his deal-clinching manoeuvres and his wearing of situational garbs have been the subject  of the  narrative poetry of many composers. Vasudha Kesav, during her concert organised by Mudhra at Infosys Hall, enthralled the audience by presenting a sound selection of some of these compositions.The varnam, &#8216;Neerajaksha Neeve&#8217; (Kalyanavasantham) sought to set the languid pace for the songs &#8216;Yadhukulathilaka&#8217; (Chakravaham-Garbapurivasar) and &#8216;Balakrishnan Padhamalar&#8217; (Dhanyasi-Sivan) that followed. The choice then fell on Khamas (&#8216;Santhana Gopalakrishnam&#8217;-Dikshitar), Chandrajothi (&#8216;Bagayyanayya&#8217;-Tyagaraja) and the timeless Thodi (&#8216;Sri Krishnam Bhaja Manasa&#8217;-Dikshitar).The way in which she constructed the alapanas, handling each raga in its own characteristic trajectory Chandrajothi with its bold ventures, Khamas with its peaceful zarus and swift and concise brigas, Thodi with its grand majestic phrases &#8212; made one feel &#8220;the wind beneath her wings.&#8221;The speedy niraval at &#8216;Alanaadu Kowra&#8217; (for &#8216;Bagayyanayya&#8217;) and the customary niraval, in all kalams at &#8216;Changu Chakra Gadha&#8217; (for &#8216;Sri Krishnam&#8217;) perhaps meant her liberal concession to variety.The other relevant numbers were &#8216;Smaravaram&#8217; (Sadasiva Brahmendrar), &#8216;Bhavayami Gopalabalam&#8217; of Annamayya (which prefaced a slokam from Krishna Karnamritham), &#8216;Begabaro Begabaro&#8217; and a Mangalam invoking the blessings of Lord Krishna, the last two by Purandara Dasa.Vasudha has an unfailing command over sruthi and her voice has a soft radiance which she marshals well to modulate it with effectiveness and ease. These days, her music has acquired a standard that is well-founded and grounded on the strongest of bases. One thought a Meera bhajan seemed essential, even mandatory in such a &#8220;Krishna-conscious-concert&#8221;. It may have brought to the fore certain Hindustani graces that Vasudha&#8217;s voice is capable of. Shertalai Sivakumar on the violin had his class pronounced when he immersed himself in an extraordinary mandhara sthayi alapana of Thodi and answered fairly adequately during the kalpanaswara phases. Parupalli Phalgun on the mridangam amply demonstrated how the limiting of &#8216;nadha&#8217; levels enhances the stature of the accompanist and simultaneously elevates the concert too. He presented a thani of short sollus of sterling qualities that was of an ideal duration.
