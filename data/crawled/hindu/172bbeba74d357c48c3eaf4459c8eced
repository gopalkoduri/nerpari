VG NB fervour wafted strong in Singapore, on October 31, at the SIFAS Hall, drawing a large crowd, despite the torrential rain. Trichur Ramachandran regaled the listeners with vintage GNB, ably accompanied by SIFAS' tutors, Sivaraman on the electric violin and Sundaresan on the mridangam.GNB's rarely heard Hindolam varnam was followed by his popular &#8216;Vara Vallabha' in Hamsadhwani. A good raga delineation of Pantuvarali and Tyagaraja's &#8216;Siva Siva' were next.Melodious and sprightlyAbhogi and GNB's &#8216;Tamasamiga Talamu' were melodiously rendered, with a sprightly Andolika delighting the listeners immediately after. A fast Chenchu Khambodi in true GNB style was sung before Ramachandran took up Kalyani, the main raga for the evening.A very pleasing thani led to GNB's famed tukkadas &#8212; &#8216;Sonnadai Seidida,' &#8216;Radha Sametha,' &#8216;Dikku Teriyada' and his &#8216;Vande Mataram' slokam sequence, in ragamalika &#8212; Amir Kalyani and Sindhubhairavi.On the whole, Singapore remembered the beloved maestro, in an excellently conducted event.Dr. Kasi, one of the chief movers at SIFAS, spoke before the concert, highlighting salient points in GNB's stellar life.A short audio visual presentation with excerpts from the DVD &#8216;GNB-legend immortal' transporting the rasikas to the magic of the GNB era. A two-hour workshop was organised the next morning by Ramachandran, who taught the nuances of GNB's compositions, to all who wished to learn.
