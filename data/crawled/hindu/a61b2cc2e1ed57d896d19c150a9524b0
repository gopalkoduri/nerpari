VThe septuagenarian is an embodiment of refined imagination and exuberant artistry fortified by simplicity. It is not any flashy, technical glitter but an irrepressible flow of serenity that mesmerises the audience. He establishes a musical intimacy between himself and the presentations (anuvya vasaya) on the one hand, and creates a sentimental commonness between him and the audience (saadharanikarana) on the other. Now, the relish (rasa) emerges unbounded and untainted.Badha khyal in Shyamkalyan, &#8220;Jeeyo Mero Lal&#8221; was the opening prastuti. Only after exhaustive interpretations (ragavisthar) spanning over the mandra and the poorvanga of the madhya sapthak, he engaged himself in unfurling the finer aspects in the higher pitches. The characteristic masculine progressions opened this musical scenario for glimpses into Dhrupad-style of renditions. Listeners enjoyed a fine integration: the individual merging into the personality of the raga.The virile voice readily resonated up to the mandra shadja, traversed meaningfully over the madhya sapthak, until it merged with the taara panchama: pre-requisites of an ideal voice collectively termed Deepanam-Bharathamuni. Melody accompanist&#8217;s complementary interludes had great deal in inspiringly reciprocating the singer&#8217;s extempore.The veteran drew ample support from embellishments like behalavas, bolalaaps, boltaans and the like. The taans included akartaans, boltaaans (transforming into heavy gamaks whenever his intuitive instincts warranted), brisk sapaat taans and sargam taans.In chota khyal, lively sams kept up the vitality of the cheez and lovely tihayis consummated it. Rhythm- accompanist&#8217;s soothing tekas and attractive layakaris commanded appreciation. &#8220;Savaldo Mane&#8221; (Shankara), a tarana (Khamach-Dinakar Kaikini) and &#8220;Babul Mora&#8221; (Bhairavi - Arzoo Lakhnavi - creating a haunting pensive mood) were other absorbing inclusions.With measured progressions and authoritative style Rupa Mahadevan&#8217;s concert at Beladingala Sangeetha, arranged by J.S.S. Math, commanded wholehearted approbations and unreserved appreciations. Clarity in the mandra, melody in tara sthayi, reflex responses to imagination, deep akaras and overall consistency marked her concert.&#8220;Shri Mahaganapathim&#8221; (Atana- Jayachamaraja Wadiyar) that followed the varna &#8220;Chalamela&#8221; (Natakuranji - Mulaivittu Rangaswami Nattuvanar) indicated hard practice and dedication. That the artiste had a strong inclination for details, and was neat in presenting them was evident in both &#8220;Bhajanaseyarada&#8221; (Dharmavathi &#8211; Vasudevacharya) and &#8220;Upacharamu&#8221; (Bhairavi- Thyagaraja).The alapanas emerged spontaneously, reinforced with fine gamakas and sancharas. All the merits brought to the fore the relevant moods embodied in the compositions (observe the neraval at &#8220;Niravadi Sukhadayakuni&#8221;). The swara prasthara comprised compact and lively phrases.Consistent and competent Aditi (violin) enriched the overall impact. The percussionists, P. Nataraj (mridanga) and S. Manjunath (ghata) exercising discretion enhanced the musician&#8217;s musical, lyrical and emotional impacts. To set a higher benchmark, one may aspire for a transcending accomplishment. Heavy breathing (in alapanas) and occasional wrong-splitting of words need attention.Other major inclusions were &#8220;Chitham Irangadenayya&#8221; (Shahana-Papanasam Sivan), &#8220;Brindavanadolu Aduvarare&#8221; (Purandaradasa) and a tillana.
