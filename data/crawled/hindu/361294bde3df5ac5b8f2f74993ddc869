VThe ambition of the well-known musician couple Sriram Parasuram and Anooradha Sriram is to give their audience a comparative picture of the styles and ragas in Carnatic and Hindustani styles of classical music.  While Anooradha also happens to be a playback singer in South Indian cinema, Sriram was a child prodigy who grew up to be a great violinist in the Carnatic style and did research in the western too. A young scholar today,  his voice has become so bold that, at times, it sounds as vigorous as that of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. He gets lost at times in hisbirkas. Anooradha, on the other hand, is a mellifluous singer with a gifted voice that can scale to three octaves with comfort.Perfect partnersBeing good at both the styles, they developed such a method that they can move into opposite styles when required. While Anooradha sings in Hindustani, her husband takes up an equivalentragain the Carnatic system and vice-versa. Or, they sing a Carnatic or a Hindustani composition together at times.All this was seen when they performed ajugalbandiorganised by Laya celebrating its second anniversary, at Thyagaraya Gana sabha last week.Sriram began the show with theAlapofAhir Bhairav. Thevilambitphase revealed its beauty at various phases, on a wonderfulsruthibase. Then he moved toChakravakam, the corresponding Carnaticraga,and Anooradha picked up from him.The significant difference in both styles is the rendition of thegamakas. They renderedGajanana YutaminChakravakamwith excellentswarastructuring. Then they changed over to the Hindustani style again for theKhyalbut  stepped up tempo inMadhyalayaanddrutphase inTeen Tal. As usual, the finishing speed was a thrill.Aarabhiwas the chosenragaas it is closely equivalent toDurgaof Hindustani. Sriram and Anooradha, shared the rendition of the tworagasin both the styles. Sriram and Anooradha joined in presenting the famousPancharatnakritiof Thyagaraja &#151;SadhincheneinAarabhi.BhavaniinMadhyaandDhruttempos, withAkaar TaansandSargam, turned out to be a beauty.Revathiand its Hindustani equivalentByragi Bhairaviwas their next choice. B.S. Narayan (violin), S. Arvind (mridangam), B. Kulkarni (harmonium) and Najmuddin Javed (tabla) were in the musical ensemble contributing to the overall appeal.The noisy audience  who became part of thejugalbandiin the most uncalled for fashion, in addition to the sultry atmosphere and uncooperative mike system, were certain things that did not go well with the concert.Pleasant renditionIn another concert held last week, accomplished carnatic vocalist Devarakonda Vijayalakshmi gave a performance at Necklace Road, a fine venue offering a perfect ambience for a vocal recital of this standard. Vijayalakshmi is the disciple ofnadaswara vidwanK. Veerabhadra Rao of Kakinada.Gifted with a mellifluous voice, she was accompanied by Komanduri Venkata Krishna on violin and Sridharachari on ghatam. She opened her concert withVaravallabha RamanainHamsadhwani, as an invocation to lord Ganesh. Then she renderedNenarunchinanuof Thyagaraja inMalavi.The majorragaof the evening from her wasHindolam. She evolved it well giving it comprehensive look. She rendered in thisSamaja Vara Gamanaalso of Thyagaraja. It was a pleasant rendition and thekritipart had a fineswaraprastharain theragachain ofBilahari, Kaanada, BehagandRevathi.The concert was followed by brief Kuchipudi dance by Sowmya and Kusuma.Ganesa Panchakamand aJavali-SarasamuladetandukuinKapiandDasavathara Sabdamwere impressively presented.GUDIPOODI SRIHARIBottom Template Starts
