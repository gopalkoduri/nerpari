VBeethoven, Bach and Mozart were often hailed as the Trinity of Western Classical Music and brought about a renaissance in world of music. This is true of Carnatic music as well &#8212; Thyagaraja, Muttuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Shastry, revolutionised the way we perceive Carnatic music today.Of the trinity, one often sees an abundant focus on Saint Thyagaraja while relatively little is known about Muttuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Shastry.Guruguhaamrta, a trust dedicated exclusively to the compositions of Muttuusvami Dikshitar, is the brain child of Carnatic musician G. Ravi Kiran, student of R.K. Srikantan and T.M. Krishna.Guruguhaamrta, which is a year old, is the first of its kind in Karnataka dedicated to the preservation and propagation of Muttusvami Dikshitar's kritis.Muttusvami Dikshitar was a nada yogi and one of the most prolific and profound vaggeyakaras in the Indian classical music firmament. Dikshitar's kritis are treasure troves of Sangeeta, Sahitya and Vedanta.Sri Krishna Kalakshetra (ISKCON) and Guruguhaamrta will be jointly presenting a few rarely heard compositions of Muttusvami Dikshitar in Guruguhagaanam on the November 13, at the Multi Vision Theatre, ISKCON, Bangalore, 5.30 p.m.Fourteen prominent youth musicians including G. Ravi Kiran, Amritha Venkatesh, Krishna Prasad, Vinay Hegde, Hariharan, Vrinda Acharya would be sharing the stage and showcasing the choicest of Dikshitar's kritis.Charulata Ramanujam on violin and C.
