VExcerpts from a live concert of Nithyasree Mahadevan have been released in a CD album in which she is accompanied by Usha Rajagopalan on the violin, I. Sivakumar on the mridangam and Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam. `Thulasidhala' in Mayamalavagowla by Tyagaraja that describes the peerless qualities of the sacred `Thulasi' with clear diction underlining the neraval in the charanam, and the crisp, sarvalaghu swaras create the right ambience for involved listener participation.Sriranjani, the shadava, shadava janya of Kharaharapriya enriched by sruti-aligned karvais and melodic prayogas in the various octaves, reveal the artiste's prodigious talent and the amazing range of her vocal chords.The violinist, a mature player, unfolds the raga with pleasing traditional sancharas.`Marubalga,' an extremely popular Tyagaraja composition adorning the concert stage some five decades ago, is a sound, refreshing version.`Mohana Kara' of Koteeswara Iyer in the 60th Mela Neethimathi is a fulfilling interpretation with the vivadi note shadsruti dhaivatam absolutely in its groove.The kalpanaswaras are indicative of the singer's confidence in handling the dhaivatam without any hesitation. Muthuthandavar's `Eesane' in Nalinakanti dipped in honeyed melody, commands rasika appreciation in full measure.The Tamil viruttam sung beautifully in Desh with melody occupying the driver's seat, and Bharatiar's `Varuvai' in the same raga keep the coffers of sukha bhava overflowing. K. S. Raghunathan's tillana in Karnaranjani and Oothukkadu Venkatasubbayyar's `Pullai Piravi' in Chenchurutti that is featured after the mangalam testify that Nithyasree is an inspirational musician who sets commendable standards for her art.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
