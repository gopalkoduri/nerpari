VTheVirahotkanthitanayika, also called Ukta, is sad and lonely. She confides in her friend, the sakhi, telling her of her sense of loss. In some songs she is portrayed as coaxing her friend to deliver a message to the beloved to come quickly.Due to the pangs of separation, the nayika loses weight and has no interest in food, drink or recreation. All enjoyable experiences seem to her to be a punishment.Characteristic poetic images include the nayika chiding the moon for scorching her with its rays, which she used to find beautiful and cooling, but which burn her now with their intensity. Also, she grows so thin that her bangles slip off her wrists. The murmuring sound of bees pierces her ears. Romantic pairs, like nesting birds, as also metaphors for love, like creepers with trees, the bee and the lotus, etc., intensify her pain at being away from her lover.
