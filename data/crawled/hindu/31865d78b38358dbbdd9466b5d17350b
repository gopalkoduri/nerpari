VSrivani Arjun, a native of Cuddapah, gave a superlative exhibition of her voice which was perfectly sruthi aligned, had beautiful modulation and an amazing range. Her voice has a mesmerising effect on the audience. A disciple of Dwaram Lakshmi of Padmavathi Mahila University, Srivani took her Master's Degree from the University and is an A grade artiste in light Music and B High artiste in classical music. She broadcasts her music from the Cuddapah AIR.Srivani's concert, on the second day of the anniversary music festival, stood as a model in faultless singing. The versatile singer rendered only a few classical items and went on to sing several lighter pieces, devotional items and even Hindustani items. She sang Sri Maha Ganapathim in Nata, Sitamma Mayamma in Vasanta, Bagayenayya in Chandrajyothi and Swati Tirunal's Sankara Srigiri in Hamsanandi and then continued with lighter items which included a Meerabhajan in Desh, a Baba Keertana, a Kalabramha Tatvam, an Annamacharya kiirtana, a mini ghazal and other songs.Srivani won the hearts of the audience with her spellbindingly attractive voice. She was well supported on violin by Palaparthi Nageswara Rao and on mridangam by B. Suresh Babu. If Srivani stayed in cultural centres like Vijayawada or Hyderabad , she could reach great heights.Staying in remote Cuddapah is certainly a handicap to her career.
