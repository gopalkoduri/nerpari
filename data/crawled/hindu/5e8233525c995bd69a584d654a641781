VThe Thyagaraja Aradhana festival this year kick started with the presentation of dance ballet Sri Rama Nityopacharamulu, on January 23. Culture lovers witnessed the rendering of Thyagaraja's compositions over the next four days at Kalabharathi, Vishakapatnam. His Aradhana trust, in association with Visakha Music and Dance Academy, organised the event beginning with the offering of puja followed by Ooregimpu of the Vaggeyakara's idol along with that of his inspired divination Sri Rama in the morning. Nearly one hundred vocal artistes along with more than a dozen violinists and an equal number of mridangam artistes devoutly rendered Ghana Raga Pancha Ratna krithi seva in exemplary unison.Several artistes from different age groups rendered compositions of the Vaggeyakara individually and together for 10 minutes each till about 4 p.m., followed by performances by junior artistes for 15-minute durations each till about 6 p.m. This was followed by singing of Thyagaraja compositions for 30-minute duration each till 10 p.m. by established and noted exponents of Carnatic music.Similar programmes were held on the next three days starting from 9 a.m. Despite his busy organisational involvement, secretary of the VMDA and the Trust, G.R.K. Prasad amazingly rendered Aradhana by way of singing compositions of Thyagaraja evocatively on the third evening.The half an hour recital was ably supported by noted violinist Dwaram Durga Prasada Rao, making the recital stand apart in the four-day Aradhana festival.Similarly, the vice-president of the trust, 89-year-old I.V.L. Sastry rendered 30-minute recital before concluding the sessions. The soulful Aradhana concluded with the rendering of Manthrapushpam and Mangalaharathi at 9.30 p.m. on January 27.
