VMystic Dunes - CDAmaan Ali Khan And AyaanAli KhanMusic Today - Rs. 295.The talented siblings, Amaan Ali Khan and Ayaan Ali Khan are the sons and disciples of the redoubtable sarod exponent Amjad Ali Khan, who has perhaps redefined the art of sarod playing with his remarkable, conscious efforts to break fresh ground. His performance quotient constantly remains at the optimum level.This album by the brothers titled, `Mystic Dunes' describes it as a world music extravaganza on the vast desert scape, bringing alive musically the various elements of the desert such as its starkness, contrasting colours, the empty echoes emphasising melodically the loneliness of the environment and portraying the all encompassing magnificent cultural pulse of this vast land.The artistes have composed the music for all the tracks with praiseworthy imagination in sweet, soft captivating tunes, combining sensitively tradition, with a pleasant folksy gait. Desh, Sindhubhairavi and Darbari are some of the melodies that leave a substantial impact on the heart and mind. The singing and oral rhythmic passages enhance listening quality. It is to the credit of the artistes, and more importantly their guru that they have taken quantum leaps in the path to progress.S. P.Bottom Template Starts
