VThe music festival organised by Poornatrayee Foundation at Thripunthura was different as it not only paid  tribute to music, but to womanhood also, which is all about honouring &#8216;Shakthi&#8217; and extolling womanhood.  All  12 concerts in conne\u000action with the festival were sung by  women vocalists.Modelled on the famous music festival at the Navaratri Mandapam in Thiruvananthapuram, the concerts were composed and codified by Poornathrayee Jayaprakash, a modern-day vagaykkara. Jayaprakash included 11 ragas that included the traditional Navaratri ragas such as  Sankarabharanam, Kalyani, Saveri, Thodi, Bhairavi, Panthuvarali, Shuddha Saveri, Nattakurinji, Arabhi and Poorvikalyani. &#8216;Poornathrayeesa Panchapadi,&#8217; a series of kirtanas composed by Jayaprakash, was also included in the festival. This was rendered by Vishalam Venkatachalam. Every day, before the concert began, the main raga of the day was played on the veena.The festival began with a breezy concert by Bangalore M.S. Sheela.
