VKaivalya Kumar is name less circulated in concert circles, despite him being a highly talented young man. His voice culture with an innate capacity of manoeuvring all technical features in a concert is praiseworthy. He never experienced any trouble either in Anumandra or Tarasthayies. The voice was as fresh in the finalmangalamas it was in his opening -varnam. He never had any problem in all the three octaves in maintainingshrutiandlaya. His style of rendition seems to be dashed with a bit of Hindustani expression, now and then, which added to the melodic appeal. He is the disciple of Annapoorna and P. V. Seshaiah Sastry. He has also mastered the art of lyric writing and composing in classical music that was noticed in hisvarnaminKapi,with which he opened the concert for Hyderabad Music Circle, last week. At a concert in Thyagaraya Ganasabha mini Hall, he was accompanied by Dinakar on violin and P. V. Ramanamurthy on mridangam.
