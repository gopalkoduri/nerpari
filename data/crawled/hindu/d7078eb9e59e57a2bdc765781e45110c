VMusical legend M. Balamuralikrishna&#8217;s concert at Payyannur, Kannur, turned out to be a memorable one for music buffs. He began his concert with &#8216;Vathapi, &#8217;the popular Dikshitar kriti in Hamsadwani. Unlike most singers, he chose to follow Tiger Varadacharya&#8217;s style of singing &#8216;karangusha&#8217; at a slow pace and followed it up with a set of swarams. &#8216;Kripaalavaala,&#8217; a jaunty, not-so-popular Tyagaraja kriti in Naadavaraangini, followed.The next number &#8216;Chintayaami santhatam&#8217; in Sucharitram,&#8217; the 67th Melakartha raga, showcased his skills as a composer. This kriti in honour of Dikshitar was composed by Dr. Balamuralikrishna when he was 14. Although Dr. Balamuralikrishna has won fame and popularity as a singer, his genius as a composer remains to be studied and acknowledged.The main song of the evening was the famous Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Maatalaadamodi galada&#8217; in Charukesi. He started the song from &#8216;Modigalada&#8217; and embellished it with some exceptional swarams. The rapport between the singer and the accompanists enriched the rendition. He was accompanied by Mahadeva Sharma on the violin, B. Harikumar on the mridangam and Karthick on the ghatam. The tani avarthanam was a treat for the audience.After the magnificent main piece, he rendered &#8216;Raadaa naa meeda daya leda,&#8217; a lovely song by Kuppu Swamayya in Hamir Kalyani. A kriti popularised by Dr. Balamuralikrishna during his early years, it is rarely heard nowadays. Then came another of his compositions &#8216;Maa maanini&#8217; in Todi, a swaraakshara keerthanam where the swaram and the sahityam are the same. It emphasised his prowess as a composer.Karthik&#8217;s request for a song on Anjaneya gifted the beautiful Balamuralikrishna composition &#8216;Hanuma anuma&#8217; in Sarasaangi raagam. The highlight of this kriti is that the swaram &#8216;ma&#8217; is ingeniously woven into the composition whenever the letter &#8216;ma&#8217; comes in the lyrics.The melodious Ashtapathi &#8216;Raadhika tava virahe&#8217; in Janasammodini was followed by the evergreen &#8216;Pibare Raamarasam,&#8217; a Sadashiva Brahmendra composition in Aahir Bhairav. &#8216;Aaj aaye shyaam mohan&#8217; in Misra Pahadi, a Swati Tirunal composition, transported the listeners to the banks of the Yamuna.The curtain came down on the recital with Dr. Balamuralikrishna&#8217;s thillana in Kunthalavarali. By the time he sang the Mangalam, many of the listeners were clapping their hands along with the rhythm of the song.The concert was organised by Swami Krishnanandji.
