VBhubaneswar Music Circle's first monthly programme of the year 2005-2006 featured Aswini Kumar Verma in an evening of ghazals. Verma, grandson of Lakshmandas, a great exponent of `Dhrupad-Dhamar' and son of Ratan Chand Verma of the Punjab gharana has an ancient  tradition to boast of.Aswini Verma follows a pure raga-based style of ghazal `gayaki'.This evening he began with a ghazal in `raag' "Puriya Dhanasree". The ghazal was `Jo log jaan bujhke nadaan ban gaye/mera khayal hai ke woh insaan ban gaye', a tongue-in-cheek comment on the hypocrisy today. Verma went on to present `ghazals' using various `ragas' like `Pahadi' . While basing the composition on pure `raga' is all right it is a bit unsuitable to `ghazal gayaki' because `ghazal' is primarily poetry and improvisation here and a twist and turn there sometimes enhances the effect of the poetry unlike what it is in `khayal' singing. So the impact was missing in many `ghazals' that Verma rendered by sticking puritanically to `ragas'. However, for the aficionados of classical music it was a refreshing departure from the modern-day `ghazal gayaki', which at times dishes out `geets' and that too in pop style!Pandit Umesh Kar gave creditable accompaniment on the tabla but Pandit Kar's tendency of dominating the show with his fireworks sometimes mars the main performer as was evidenced this evening too.B.M.Bottom Template Starts
