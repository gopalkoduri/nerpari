VUmayalpuram K. Sivaraman presented his &#8216;Cascade of Bliss,&#8217; a classical fusion programme with mridangam, violin, kanjira and piano, strung together with vocal music, as part of &#8216;Isai Amudham 2009&#8217; under the auspices of Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha, Tirupur. The  violin has already become an inseparable part of Carnatic music. Now, Sivaraman has tried to woo the piano into its fold by inviting Anil Srinivasan  to be part of his ensemble. Ace violinist M.A. Sundareswaran (of the Parur School), was the mood-setter that day, weaving magic  on his violin. From the height of southern classicism, his music metamorphosed itself into pure western style. He effortlessly let a lilting folk tune float and with the same ease switched over to Hindustani.The &#8216;Cascade&#8217; started flowing with Madurai G.S.Mani&#8217;s &#8216;Naadha Moolasthitham&#8217; in Hamsadhwani, set to Kanda Eka talam, after the vocal invocation to Lord Ganesha by M.A. Sundareswaran. Sivaraman had taken care to include popular kritis such as &#8216;Kaa, Vaa, Vaa,&#8217; &#8216;Vellaithaamarai Poovil Iruppaal,&#8217; &#8216;Raghuvamsa Sudhaambudhi Chandra,&#8217; &#8216;Vallikkanavan Perai&#8217; and &#8216;Alai Paayudhe&#8217; (main).The splendid chittaswaras in Kadhanakuthuhalam for &#8216;Raghuvamsa Sudhaambudhi Chandra&#8217; fell flat when they were presented in the beginning of the kriti that day. Perhaps Patnam Subramaniya Iyer had his own reasons for placing them where they are.The notable pieces in the lighter session were Muthaiah Bhagavatar&#8217;s &#8216;English note,&#8217; &#8216;Magudi&#8217;, and the deeply philosophical &#8216;Vettaveli Thanil&#8217; a composition by Kudhambai Sithar. The programme concluded with &#8216;Jayathi Jayathi Bharatha Maatha&#8217; and &#8216;Vaazhiya Senthamizh.&#8217;Saketharaman, the youngest in the troupe, vindicated himself very impressively with his singing. Anil Srinivasan&#8217;s piano blended beautifully with Sundareswaran&#8217;s violin and was pleasing to the ears (especially his concluding touches to the &#8216;English note&#8217; and &#8216;Magudi&#8217;). The remarkable feature about this concert is that common songs were made more enjoyable by that special touch by the artists.While delineating Sivaranjani, for the ragamalika, &#8216;Kuraiondrumillai,&#8217; Sundareswaran deceptively introduced the AIR tune which was fascinating. Thani was absolutely impressive.Sivaraman, with his sixty three years of stage experience, threw challenge after challenge and B.Sundar Kumar on the kanjira, answered it with equal force, earning appreciation from the challenger himself.Sivaraman&#8217;s fingers danced on both sides, producing a lively medley of rhythms. Konnakkol by the veteran was also very well received by the audience.It was an enjoyable concert, but the piano should have received a little more focus to justify the name, &#8216;fusion.&#8217; However, it is to Sivaraman&#8217;s credit that he could bring together artists of different generations belonging to different schools of music.M.Balamuralikrishna sang on the final day of the music festival, accompanied by Mysore Manjunath on the violin, Tiruchi  B. Harikumar on the mridangam and Giridhar Udupa on the ghatam.The multi-faceted music legend astonished the rasikas not only by the timbre of his voice that remains intact till date, but also gratified their taste with the sumptuous aural feast he offered.
