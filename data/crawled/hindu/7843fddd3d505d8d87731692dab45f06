VThe 173rd Vardhanthi of Muthuswamy Dikshitar, one of the great Trinity of Carnatic Music, was fittingly conducted jointly by Sama Gana Lahari Trust of Vijayawada and Bharathiya Sangeeta Vaibhavam Trust of Chennai at Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram, Vijayawada. Many city-based vidwans came together to present a 12 hour-long concert that comprised rendering of Dikshitar compositions. The programme began at 9.00 a.m and was inaugurated by Yabaluri Lokanadha Sarma, a patron and lover of arts.Before the renditions, there was an enlightening lecture on the great composer and his contribution to Carnatic music by scholar Yanamandra Srinivasa Sarma. Sarma explicitly demonstrated the features of Dikshitar&#8217;s keertanas and said that almost all his compositions were written in chaste Sanskrit with Raga Mudras figuring in most of the keertanas. Sarma added that Muthuswamy enriched Carnatic music by his great compositions and strode the musical firmament as a colossus and bequeathed his musical treasure for the upliftment of standards of carnatic music.Prominent musicians Annavarapu Ramaswamy, Malladi brothers, Malladi Suribabu, M. Sudhakar, C.V.P. Sastri, K. Kurmanath, Vishnubhotla sisters Saraswathi and Krishnaveni, Anjana Sudhakar, D. Vasavi, M. Nagalakshmi, D. Harini, Jyothi and Prameela rendered Dikshitar compositions melodiously and with devotion.No keertana was repeated and many rare keertanas were heard. A highlight was the Poorvikalyani KeertanaMeenakshi Me Mudam Dehiwhich was said to be the last composition of Dikshitar. This item was sung by the whole group and came as a fitting climax to the 12-hour session.Instrumental support was provided by A. Muralikrishna, P. Nageswara Rao, P. Nandakumar, V. Krishnaveni (violins) and M.L.N. Raju, B.V.S. Prasad, K. Sadgurucharan, N.S. Kalyanaraman, M. Vijayakumar, A. Prasad, P.S. Phalgun, K. Sai Giridhar, Anilkumar and Anjaneya Sastri (on mridangam).
