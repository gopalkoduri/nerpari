VBombay Jayashri  presented soft and sophisticated music while Nithyasree Mahadevan enthralled the audience with a colourful fare in her rich voice. T.N. Seshagopalan&#8217;s  music  appealed more to the  rasikas than those new to Carnatic music.Kadri Gopalnath and Kunnakkudi Vaidhyanathan offered what would please the audience, and in return, won great applause.Some of the junior artistes too  showed real promise. A special mention can be made of L.Ranjani, who, endowed with a pleasing voice, was good at both elaboration of ragas and rendering light songs.As the brightly clad Kadri Gopalnath stepped on to the stage, accompanied by A.Kanyakumari (violin), Haridwaramangalam A.K.Pazhanivel (tavil), Vaikkom Gopalakrishnan (ghatam) and Rajasekhar (morsing), the applause grew louder  with the expectation of three hours of enjoyable music.  The navaragamalika varnam, &#8216;Valachi Vachi&#8217; opened the flood gates of lively saxophone, sweetened by Kanyakumari who followed him on the violin like a shadow. Then followed Syama Sastri&#8217;s majestic swarajathi, &#8216;Kamaakshi&#8217; in Bhairavi. &#8216;Mal Marugaa, Shanmugaa&#8217; in Vasantha was intoxicating with its briskness. The inevitable &#8216;Raghuvamsa Sudhambudhi Chandra&#8217; (Kadhanakuthuhalam-Patnam Subramaniya Iyer) and &#8216;Entharo Mahanubhavulu&#8217; (Sree-Tyagaraja) flowed forth while &#8216;Nagumomu&#8217; (Abheri-Tyagaraja) was presented as the centre piece with kalpanaswaras in many ragas, followed by a scintillating thani by the masters of percussion.A.K.Pazhanivel&#8217;s tavil thundered and whispered, raced and lingered and proved why he has achieved such fame. Listeners&#8217; requests started pouring in  and  Gopalnath included many of them with a sweet smile.Kunnakkudi Vaidhyanathan  described himself as a departmental store before beginning his recital. He assured the audience that they would get whatever they wanted, whether it was pure classical music, light music or film songs.Starting his concert with the Tiruppugazh &#8216;Kaiththala Nirai Kani&#8217; in Gambhiranattai, he presented &#8216;Samaja Vara Gamana&#8217;, &#8216;Brochevarevarura&#8217; and &#8216;Raghuvamsa Sudhambudhi&#8217;. He also settled for &#8216;Nagumomu&#8217; as the main piece and in the place of kalpanaswaras in different ragas, played different songs, such as &#8216;Oru Naal Podhumaa&#8217;, &#8216;Adugindranadi Thillaiyile&#8217; and even included &#8216;Snehithane&#8217;. At times, he  plucked the strings producing a peculiar sound which was also greeted with applause.It was difficult to understand whether he was giving what the audience wanted or the audience liked what he gave. The purists were squirming in their seats, but that did not deter Kunnakkudi from moving from one film song to another. Even they had to agree that only he could bring the common man to the sabha. He did not pretend to lift the taste of the audience. Instead he reached them and let them have a great time. He also had an impressive set of accompaniments &#8212; mridangam, ghatam, tabla, kanjira and morsing, which joined together to create a melee of music. The last part consisted only of film songs, mostly old favourites.The venue was  hospitable,  with enough space for the children to move about and the  canteen run by popular Friends Catering was almost always full. It was heartening to see many young faces among the audience. The judicious selection of the artistes could have done the trick.
