VOf late Western music is rising on the popularity graph among the youth of India. Stars like Eminem, Bryan Adams and the others are listened to more than they ever were.However another genre of music, which is gaining in popularity due to a number of events, Page 3 parties and increasing corporate interest is Indian classical music. With the young talent coming in, the classical music has a feeling of youth attached to it. People like Ayaan Ali and Amaan Ali Bangash have brought a new attraction to classical music.Some may frown at their constant smiles and great attention to trivia, but nobody can deny that they do help to bring in the crowd, even if they are not the best performers around.The duo created an interesting atmosphere when they played at the Imperial this past week to mark the first anniversary celebration of Club One Air. Club One Air is said to have started the concept offractionalownership, which enables the individuals to own an aircraft at a fraction of the cost without acquiring the entire aircraft.For the pleasure of the glitterati Amaan and Ayaan also played some popular Bollywood numbers, which were quite well received. The presence of their father, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, gave them enough inspiration to mesmerize the people with their delightful music.Shafquat Hussain, the Sufi singer who came from across the border, provided the icing on the cake. He fascinated the crowd with his hour-long high voltage performance which concluded with the cheers of the gathered crowd asking for more.Bottom Template Starts
