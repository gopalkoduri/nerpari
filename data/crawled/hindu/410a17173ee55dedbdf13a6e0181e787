VO.S. Thiagarajan recently enthralled audiences with his resonant and commanding voice in the &#8216;Eppadi Padinaro' series, jointly organised by R.R. Sabha and Sri Krishna Sweets at the F.G.N. Hall,Tiruchi, recently.Starting with a Sri raga varnam, he fully exploited Harikhambodi in the kriti &#8216;Rama Nannu Brova' and Phalamanjari in &#8216;Sanadhana'. He rendered Begada (&#8216;Kadaikkan Petraen') in two speeds, with pleasing swara sallies.His extensive Thodi (&#8216;Kaddhanusari'), with exhaustive niraval and apt swaras, was a highlight of his recital.The maestro captivated rasikas with his classic rendering of Saveri (&#8216;Bhajare Adhu Natham'), Khamas (&#8216;Madhuve'), Sriranjani (&#8216;Kana Vendamo') and a fast Devagandhari (&#8216;Vinaradhana'). The violin support by Pudukkaottai Ambikaprasad was apt and his Thodi and Begada essays were noteworthy.The unassuming Thiagarajan (mridangam) was strong in rhythm and his thani was vibrant.
