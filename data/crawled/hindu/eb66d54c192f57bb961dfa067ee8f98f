VG.SWAMINATHANListening to S.P.Ramh the other day, one was reminded of a short story by Seetha Ravi,Kalkieditor. Therein she had discussed the third song of a recital that decided the tenor of the concert.Well, the lilting ``Bantureeti" (Hamsanadam) indeed came like a gush of fresh breeze giving the performance at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan for G.K.Foundation a whole new perspective.  Neither the soporific Huseni varnam nor ``Sri mahaganapathi" (Gowlai) that preceded the song had any impact.On the whole the concert was a mixed fare. There were both shortcomings and silver linings.  The forceful voice with a unique timber  and the choice of kritis weighed on the positive side while the uncomfortable cracks of voice at the tara sthayee and the detached delivery did cloud the performance.Emphasis on alapanaRamh's careful emphasis on raga alapana went mostly on the linear mode with adequate flourishes of glides, swirls and extensions. He fared good in the brief Hindolam (``Samagana lolane," Sivan), better in Ritigowla (``Paripalayamam" by Swati Thirunal) but surprisingly not the best in the central Sankarabharanam (``Saroja dalanetri" by Syama Sastri). Realising the limitations of his vocal chords on that particular day, Ramh mostly tackled the ragas in the middle and lower regions with neatly arranged phrases.Catchy and imaginativeNeravals at ``Rama rama mane" in Hamsanadam and ``Vara veena pani" in Keeravani (``Ambavani" by Muthiah Bhagavatar) were conspicuously catchy notwithstanding the fact that the kalpanaswara line-up was absent in the former and minimal in the latter. In ``Saroja dala netri" Ramh unleashed swaras at ``Korivachina" (sans neraval) trussing on the gandaram very imaginatively.Mullaivasal Chandramouli on the violin added worth to the raga and swara exercises with musical and dramatic improvisations.The essence he extracted meticulously in raga alapanas essentially provided substance to the item on the whole.Kudanthai Saravanan's expert fingers on mridangam elevated the concert with intricate, unrelenting and impressive beats of rhythm.Bottom Template Starts
