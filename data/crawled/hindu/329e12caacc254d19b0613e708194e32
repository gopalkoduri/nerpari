VOn October 17, the Embassy of Spain in Chennai hosted the internationally renowned Spanish guitarist Armando Orbon, who played five centuries of Spanish classical music at the Mini Hall of the Music Academy.The history of the guitar, used in a variety of musical styles like blues, country, flamenco and rock, can be traced back to at least 5,000 years. It has a common origin in Central Asia and India&#8217;s sitar. The English word &#8216;guitar&#8217; was adapted from the Spanish &#8216;guitarra&#8217; which in turn was derived from the Greek &#8216;kithara.&#8217; The earliest six string guitar is probably the one dated 1779; the first electric guitar was developed only in the 20th Century.Here was a classical musician, recipient of a number of awards in Spain and winner of International prizes, who has played in numerous concerts with Symphony Orchestras and participated in important musical festivals worldwide for more than a decade.or the eager young students of the guitar, at last face to face with the maestro, waiting to hear him perform, and the older members of the audience anticipating the exciting possibilities promised by a programme offering a sweep of five hundred years of colourful Spanish music, the evening should have been an uncommon treat. If the performance fell short of expectations, we have to admit first that the arrangements at the Mini Hall were far from satisfactory.It was too bad that there were only around 120 in the audience that night. This city, which is the centre of  Carnatic music, was given a rare chance to be exposed to another tradition and another instrument and listen to a world-class performer. But it failed to make the most of it; quite a few in the audience came to know about the event by word of mouth from friends. And a less-than-half-full hall is not conducive to bring out the best in any performer. Any electronic amplification distorts the purity of tone of the instrument /voice. Was there a need to amplify the guitar in a place as small as the Mini Hall? Orbon kept pushing the microphone away from his instrument and back again into position before throwing up his hands in despair.As important as the seating of the artiste is the provision of a music stand for him. The tallish decrepit chair that functioned as one, was a travesty of which we, the hosts, should be ashamed of. The organisers could have borrowed one easily. If Orbon did want to communicate with the audience, the organisers could have provided him a translator who did not have to run up every time to the dais from his seat in the hall. Often it was only the few who knew Spanish who reacted to Orbon&#8217;s comments. These are some of the avoidable flaws in the arrangements that night.To be fair, some of Orbon&#8217;s actions were disappointing. His changing the order of the items disrupted the evolutionary time flow of 500 years of Spanish music promised by the carefully crafted programme.Mention must be made of Orbon&#8217;s steps towards what the audience hoped would usher in a glorious evening. The sonorously beautiful chords played slowly and lovingly with the pads of his fingers, avoiding the brilliant tone the nails would have produced, unfolded Orbon&#8217;s superb interpretation of the Prelude from &#8216;The Performances for the Lute of Spanish Renaissance,&#8217; a 15th Century piece sympathetically arranged for the guitar. It symbolises the idealism and humanism of the Spanish Renaissance. Two more movements in a faster tempo were equally captivating.But then, he chose to play only two of the nine movements of the Spanish Suite by the Aragonese composer and priest Gaspar Sanz (1640-1710). Sanz&#8217;s music introduces the rhythmic antecedents of flamenco. His &#8216;Canarios&#8217; captured perfectly the jagged syncopation. Sensing the mood of the audience, Orbon continued to play but more of flamenco. He played the more popular numbers among which were &#8216;Dance no.5&#8217; by Enrique Granados, &#8216;Asturias&#8217; by Isaac Albeniz and the inimitable Manuel de Falla&#8217;s &#8216;Farruca&#8217;, so reminiscent of his &#8216;Fire Dance.&#8217;The audience went into raptures over his &#8216;Tango&#8217; by Francisco Tarrega. When Orbon chose to play only three of Fernando Sor&#8217;s well-known Variations About A Mozart Theme for encore, there was a sigh of disappointment from many. When he concluded the performance by singing &#8216;La Bamba&#8217; to a percussive accompaniment, the Chennai audience could not resist joining him.Indeed, Orbon should have been happy at least at the end when he was given a standing ovation.
