VThough music needs no language, a soulful lyric definitely adds spirit to any composition.The Pavai Festival organised by  VPMM educational institutions at Krishnankoil in Virudhunagar District, had many events lined up to pay tribute to Andal, the Lord&#8217;s ardent devotee. A music concert of &#8216;Mahanadhi&#8217; Shobana marked the finale of the festival.The breezy young Carnatic vocalist made an exuberant opening with Hamsadwani in Adi talam.The first song with a little tapestry of kalpanaswaras served as an icebreaker through the Tamil lyrics, &#8216;Akanda Sachidanandha Yaanai Mugathonae Saranam.&#8217; In her honey-soaked voice came the second number, &#8216;Alaipayuthae Kanna,&#8217; that won the hearts of the gathering.For a few seconds, she sang alapana in Sri Ranjani with a sruti unified pitch, followed by &#8216;Paale Shamma Muthu Sharathae&#8217; kriti of Purandaradasa.&#8216;Enna Thavam Seidhanai&#8217; was delivered with  remarkable bhava and modulation that gave a new tint to the good old number.Her beautiful diction and mellifluous sruti in the one-minute Abhirami Andaadhi, &#8216;Dhanam Tharum Kalvi Tharum&#8217; helped turn all faces bright.She grasped the pulse of the young audience and rendered a bouquet of popular classical and semi-classical numbers in sprightly  tone.Subramania Bharati&#8217;s &#8216;Chinenchiru Kiliye,&#8217; &#8216;Yaathumage Nindrai Kali,&#8217; &#8216;Theeratha Vilaiyaattu Pillai&#8217; and the Tamil version of &#8216;Vande Mataram,&#8217; &#8216;Nalirmani Neerum,&#8217; brought both national and divine spirits together on stage.Percussionists Boovarahar on the mridangam and H. Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam formed a superb duo and offered lively and enthusiastic support to her heart-filled sahityams.A soul-stirring performance  was the classic number, &#8216;Kaatrinilae Varum Geetham&#8217; of  M. S. Subbulakshmi.Good longevity of breath and overflowing sweetness in voice spread out through Rajaji&#8217;s &#8216;Kurai Ondrum Illai,&#8217; a ragamalika.&#8216;Azhagana Pazhani Malai Andava,&#8217; and her guru&#8217;s composition, &#8216;Chinnancheru Kuzhandai&#8217;  elevated the audience to  realms of ecstasy. Her choice of ragas &#8212; from Kaanada, Tilang, Sindhubairavi, Brindavanasaranga till the &#8216;mangalam&#8217; in Madhyamavati &#8212; was splendid.Every popular song attracted a thunderous applause. After  the youths repeatedly made a request for the film  song that made her popular in her  first appearance, she sang  &#8216;Sri Ranga Ranga&#8217;.A non-stop applause lasting  more than a minute vibrated the arena that made the child within  Shobana peep through her glittering eyes.The sweetness of her melody filled the air throughout  the concert.
