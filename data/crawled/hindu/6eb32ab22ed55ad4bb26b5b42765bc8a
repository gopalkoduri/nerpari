VThe very welcome series of illustrated talks inculcating music appreciation amongst audiences, started a few months back by the India International Centre, seems to have become immensely popular. After presenting music of Ustad Amir Khan, the evolution of Carnatic music and another illustrated talk on Gauhar Jan, the earliest recorded voice, the focus this time was on devotional music of India.Hindustani classical vocalist Subhadra Desai gave an illustrated presentation on devotional music, titled &#8220;The Unfettered Song (Vedic to Modern) Bhakti Through the Ages&#8221;. A devoted disciple of Pandit Madhup Mudgal, she has also had the privilege of being groomed by Vidushi Malini Rajurkar and Pandit Dinkar Kaikini. Being a scholar of Sanskrit language, she took full advantage of her linguistic skills this evening by opening her illustrated talk with a recitation of Hiranyagarbha Sukta from the Rig Veda in the traditional Vedic chanting style in the three Vedic swaras, namely: udatta, anuddatta and swarita.The invocation to the sun as self was taken from the Isha Upanishad , composed and sung very effectively in the raga Komal Rishabh Asavari. After the Vedic and the Upanishad age she proceeded to the Bhagvad Gita and the Buddhist Samvaada Sukta in the traditional shloka-patha style, before going on to the Bhakti Yuga and singing &#8220;Adharam madhuram&#8230;&#8221; &#8212; the highly popular devotional song written by Vallabhachaarya of the Ashta-Chhapa Bhakti-Sampradaya.Subhadra explained the difference between Saguna and Nirguna Bhakti before singing songs representing the former philosophy. There was a song of Surdas in Braj Bhasha in Maru Bihag; Meerabai's passionate devotion and intense love for Krishna based on raga Khamaj; the famous Tulsi Bhajan in Avadhi &#8220;Jab Janakinath sahaaya kare&#8221; immortalised by Pandit D.V. Paluskar; Akkamahadevi's Kannada pada invoking Basavanna; Tukaram's Marathi abhanga in Yaman Kalyan, Guru Nanak's Shabad and Narsi Mehta's Gujrati bhajan based on the typical folk tunes of Gujarat.Then Subhadra proceeded to the Nirgun bhajans like &#8220;Nit bhajo Omkaara&#8221; by Gorakh Nath, &#8220;Ram Ram rom rom&#8221; by Malukdas and the famous Kabir bhajan &#8220;Hirana samajh boojh paga dharana&#8221; synonymous with the contemplative singing of Kumar Gandharva. From the modern age she selected devotional songs of Rabindranath Tagore who had a philosophical approach to bhakti. Concluding her presentation with a Bhairavi bhajan by Surdas &#8220;Udho mohe Braja bisarat naahin&#8221;, Subhadra offered a lot of variety in terms of both sangeet and sahitya (music and literature). Her ability to creatively assimilate her academic and musical training was evident throughout the captivating performance. Khadak Singh on the tabla and Samarjeet Roy on the harmonium gave her commendable support.
