VAS PART of the monthly programmes of Music Lovers' Association (MLA), Hyderabad, a concert was recently organised in association with Sri Thyagaraya Gana Sabha at Kala Subba Rao Kala Vedika, Vivek Nagar. Sridhar R. Menon, a Kerala-based artiste who is now under the tutelage of D. Seshachary of Hyderabad, entertained music lovers with his unostentatiously impressive concert for two hours. Ramana Murthy on violin and Srinivasulu on mridangam lent excellent support.Sridhar's list of items, although limited, included a range of compositions of Patnam Subramanyam Iyer, Sadguru Thyagaraya, Mysore Vasudeva Chary, Sadasiva Brahmendra and Papanasa Sivan. The `kacheri' started off with `Saveri Varnam' and continued with `Vinayaka' in `Hamsadwani', `Brochevarevare' in `Sriranjani', `Bajana Seyarada' in `Dharmavathi', `Adamodi Galade' in `Charukesi', which was the main part rendered with utmost ease and command, `Manasa Sancharare' in `Shyama' and finally `Ennathavam Saidanai' in `Kapi'. The nerval and swarakalpana on the whole were striking.The founder of Sri Chandrasekharendra Sangeetha Educational Society, Chandrasekhar and the Association president D. Devender and Dr. K. V. Ramana honoured the artistes. While praising the activities of the Association, D. Seshachary complimented the artiste for his fine performance.Bottom Template Starts
