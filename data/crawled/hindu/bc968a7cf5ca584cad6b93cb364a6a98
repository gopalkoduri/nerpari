VA vocal concert by Vrinda Acharya, accompanied by Mathur Srinidhi (violin), Ranjini Venkatesh (mridanga), and Bhagyalakshmi Krishna (morsing) was the first in a series organised by The Bangalore Gayana Samaja as part of its Youth Music Festival &#8211; 2011.The recital began with a two speed rendition of &#8220;Vanajakshi Ninne Kori&#8221;, Pallavi Gopalayyar's varna in Kalyani raga and ata thala. A brief sketch of Athana, and &#8220;Muda Karaathamodakam&#8221;, verses from Shankaracharya's celebrated &#8220;Ganeshapancharatnam&#8221; in krithi format, followed. Embellished with intricate sangathis, the piece was set to adi tala retaining the tisra gait with an atheetha graha implicit in the sahitya itself, which heightened the impact of the few well ordered kalpana swaras that ensued.Mohanam was taken up for an alapana of moderate length, suffixed with Deekshithar's &#8220;Narasimhaagaccha&#8221;. The artiste's rich and pliant voice was employed to great advantage in the fairly detailed elaboration of Saraswathi raga, with clear sancharas in the mandra sthayi and sparkling brighas around the thara shadja and rishabha.GNB's &#8220;Saraswathi Namosthuthe&#8221; set to rupaka thala was presented with clear diction and in a vibrant tempo, and adorned with a neraval at &#8220;Karadhritha Veena&#8221;, and kalpana swaras that ended with a stint around the dhaivatha. In contrast, a mellow kalapramana illumined the lilting melody and plaintive tone of Thyagaraja's &#8220;Orajupu&#8221; in Kannadagoula and aditala. A swift &#8220;Baro Namma Manege Gopalakrishna&#8221; in Vasantha was prelude to the main item of the evening, a raga tana pallavi in Todi.The alapana was systematic, leisurely, and comprehensive, with halts at all the important junctures and replete with gamaka-laden phrases.While the artiste's free flowing manodharma highlighted the multiple shades of the raga and its immense scope, better contouring and definition in some of the lengthy sequences would have reinforced the effort.The thana displayed more variety and depth in the patterns around the thara shadja than in those around the lower notes. Set to khanda jathi thriputa tala, the pallavi beginning &#8220;Gopalakrishna Mam Pahi&#8221; featured a compact neraval and the customary tempo variations.Kalpana swaras in the second speed landing at different points in the tala and sahitya structure, indicative of improvisational and laya prowess were augmented by expert accompaniment from the violinist and percussionists.Though greater emphasis on the expansion of the pallavi and kalpana swaras would have underscored the significance of the item more effectively, the concert bore testimony to ample talent augmented by assiduous training.
