V&#8220;For me, God means a certain power and energy,&#8221; said Hariharan, after giving a soul-stirring recital of spiritual music, as part of the three-day Bhakti Utsav held at the sprawling Nehru Park garden in New Delhi this past week. Organised by the Government of Delhi and Seher, an organisation devoted to initiatives in spheres of various genres of art, literature and music, the festival showcased diverse ways of reaching out and beyond through music.After the impressive cross-cultural audience &#8211; spellbound with the rendition of devotional songs asked him for an encore &#8211; Hariharan spoke about his beliefs. &#8220;Music is a medium of reaching out to God&#8230;while singing one has to concentrate on notes, which is akin to meditation. In both cases one relates to the inner silence, which spurs spiritualism within.&#8221;He  added, &#8220;It was a unique experience to sing in an open environment, in the lap of nature&#8221;, something which came forth in his mesmerising performance from a stage erected under a sprawling neem tree.The soft-spoken Hariharan, who has several chartbusters to his credit, displayed an eclectic choice of genres, from the bhakti ras of Ram-Krishna to Sufi music in glory of Mahboob-e-Elahi to praise of Jesus. On being quizzed about the secret behind the ease with which he straddled genres, he said, &#8220;I believe that all music emanates from thinking and the proper technical assimilation of notes, which makes the genre irrelevant for the singer. It forms a part of the training one has to undergo.&#8221; Hariharan, who has trained in both Carnatic and Hindustani music, added, &#8220;The audience has really imbibed the devotion being disseminated by various artists.&#8221;On the explosion of the &#8216;spiritual industry&#8217;, with anyone and everyone connected with music joining the bandwagon, a self assured Hariharan elaborated, &#8220;Bhakti is like any other emotion, say anger, and it is natural for a creative artist to give expression to this ras as part of his musical quest.&#8221;On his famed collaboration with Leslie Lewis, as part of the smash hit Indian-English album, Colonial Cousins, he said, &#8220;We are working together on a new album which is likely to be released in December.&#8221;
