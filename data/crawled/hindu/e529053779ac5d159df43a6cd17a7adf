Kashinath (khanjira), presented a vocal concert on Saturday under the auspices of the MES Kalavedi, Bangalore.The Abhogi varna in adi tala preceded\u000aa fine rendition of the Dikshithar\u000akrithi "Pavanatmajaagaccha" in\u000aNattai raga and khanda chapu tala,\u000aincorporating a neraval and kalpana\u000aswaras at "Kapatanatakavesha".\u000a"Manavyalakincharadate" in Nalinakanthi\u000awas followed by an imaginative\u000aalapana of Dharmavathi notable\u000afor clarity of expression in the mandra\u000asthayi, a sustained stint at the\u000aplain rishabha juxtaposed with the\u000agently oscillating gandhara in the\u000amadhya sthayi and judicious use of\u000abhriga-oriented phrases beyond the\u000apanchama. The Mysore Vasudevacharya\u000akrithi "Bhajanaseyarada" in\u000arupaka tala featured a meticulous\u000aneraval and kalpana swaras at\u000a"Niravadhisukhadaya\u000akuni". "Bhogeendrasayinam" in\u000aKuntalavarali and "Naradaganalola"\u000ain Athana led to the main item of the\u000aconcert, "Nannupalimpa", the\u000aThyagaraja krithi in Mohanam set to\u000aaditala. The alapana again included\u000aseveral phrases in the mandra sthayi,\u000aon occasion touching the gandhara,\u000athough sporadic imperfections were\u000aclearly discernible in some of the\u000asancharas in the tara sthayi. The artiste's\u000ascholarship and command\u000aover laya were, however, amply evident\u000ain the neraval at "Karamuna\u000aShara Kodanda" that merged clarity\u000aof diction with melody, ably supported\u000aby the accompanists. The expansive\u000akalpana swaras, which included\u000apassages in the tishra gathi and\u000aclosed with diminishing cycles at the\u000atara shadja, were followed by a tani\u000aavarthana.The sloka "Sayamkale" and "Govindamiha",\u000aboth sung in Abheri and\u000athe Jinjhuti tillana were among the\u000aconcluding items.* * *The 13th Annual Music Festival of\u000athe Rajmahal Vilas Sangeetha Sabha\u000afeatured a vocal recital by S. Sowmya,\u000aaccompanied by Nalina Mohan (violin),\u000aH.S. Sudhindra (mridanga), and\u000aGiridhara Udupa (ghata), on Sunday.\u000a"Chalamela", the Darbar varna in\u000aadi taala was succeeded by the Panthuvarali\u000akrithi "Siva Siva Sivayanarada"\u000asupplemented with a lively\u000aneraval and kalpana swaras at "Bhagavathulatho".The alapana of Shahana,\u000areplete with the tender\u000anuances typical of the raga, Thyagaraja's\u000a"Ee Vasudha" in adi tala and a\u000afew avarthanas of kalpana swaras,\u000a"Sadachaleswaram" in Bhupalam\u000aand "Meevalla" in Kapi followed in\u000aquick succession. The fairly detailed\u000aalapana of Chandrajyothi raga highlighting\u000aits unique appeal, the vivadi\u000acharacter of its structure and the\u000aprominence of the dhaivatha with a\u000aseries of effortless and lucid phrases,\u000awas followed by "Bagayanayya" the\u000aThyagaraja krithi in adi thala, and\u000akalpana swaras.Muthaiah Bhagavathar's "Sarasamukhi"\u000ain Gouda Malhar and Thyagaraja's\u000a"Varalendu Kommani" in\u000aGurjari prefaced the main raga of the\u000aevening, Harikamboji. The mellifluous\u000aalapana, a remarkable coalescence\u000aof technical mastery and\u000acreativity, appeared to draw from an\u000aabundant store of musical ideas, with\u000athe numerous phrases around panchama\u000aand dhaivatha in the madhya\u000asthayi being especially captivating\u000a"Dinamanivamsa", the Thyagaraja\u000akrithi in adi tala incorporated an inspiring\u000aneraval that combined the sahithya\u000asyllables in a variety of\u000arhythmic permutations. The kalpana\u000aswaras accentuated with timely responses\u000afrom the violinist and expert\u000aand attentive support from the percussionists,\u000aended with a spell at the\u000adhaivatha, and was followed by a\u000ascintillating tani avarthana.
