VThe Indian Fine Arts Society presented Banu Kannan in a morning concert at Bala Mandir German Hall. She has a  powerful voice that exhibited a comfort level in all the registers. The raga alapana of  Shanmukhapriya had staid opening phrases and then flowered with breezy yet well-informed brigas. The song was &#8216;Ashta Dhasa Supeetasthithe&#8217; of Muthaiah Bhagavathar that had a fitting niraval line, &#8216;Namaroopa Rahithe-Narayani-Namosthuthe&#8217;, which has three clear phrases that could stand-alone conveniently and could be treated separately. The niraval sung deserves special mention here.Yet, Banu is  perhaps wary of voice modulation and is not sufficiently adept in the usage of the mike. The stridency in her voice demands at least an experimental look into these two techniques.There was an air of confidence in the way she carried the concert and when she sang swaras for &#8216;Sobillu Sapthaswara&#8217; (Thyagarajar-JaganMohini) that revolved around and terminated at &#8216;Ga&#8217; and for the song &#8216;Sri Maha Ganapathim Bhaje Hum&#8217; (Atana-Jayachamaraja Udayar). A little more attention may be needed in the matter of diction and elongation. &#8216;Nabhihruth Khanta Rasana&#8217;, the quintessential line in &#8216;Sobillu&#8217;, for instance, should have the final syllable as Rasana and not Rasanaa. The stretching needs to be avoided.Kalyani Shankar stood out with her alapanas and answered with reasonable well preparedness during the swara exchanges. Ramesh Srinivasan on the mridangam and Prasanna on the ghatam provided laya support and stuck to their task with fluent nadais and gave a thani that had a number of intelligent korvais of good substance.
