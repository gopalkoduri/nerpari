VVaishnava KsetraCharsur Digital work stationT. M. KrishnaDevotional (CD, Rs. 195)T.M.Krishna sang Ambujam Krishna&#8217;s compositions at a   concert in Chennai  on  September 31, 2004. A recording of the recital  has been released as a compact disc by Charsur Digital Workstation under the title of &#8216;Vaishnava Ksetra.&#8217; Krishna has rightly given more importance to the vocalisation of the songs  than  exhibiting his musical prowess.The lyrics cover six  of the Vaishnava Divya Desams and two  of the Purana sthalams. The compositions sung in the concert under review have been tuned by Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, K.R.Kedaranathan, S. Ramanathan, V.V.Sadagopan, T.N.Seshagopalan and one by T.M.KrishnaKrishna&#8217;s concert takes off with a composition on the serpent reclining Lord of Srirangam in Asaveri.  The few avarthas of kalpanaswaram for the pallavi line reveal the artiste&#8217;s maturity as many seasoned artistes have been content with only singing compositions in this raga and avoiding alapana or solfa passages.A bright rendition of a composition in Sriranjani, &#8216;Karmugil Vannan&#8217; is sung with gusto and is appropriate to the lilt of the lyrics and melody. Devagandhari is the first raga which the vocalist has chosen for a vinyasa. Both the singer and the violinist, R.K.Sriramkumar, have given a very good exposition of the raga. The violinist&#8217;s version evokes frequent appreciation from the singer. Sriramkumar due to his long term association with Krishna anticipates every move of the vocalist which enhances the beauty of his accompaniment. The composition that follows is on the Lord of the seven hills and Krishna&#8217;s tunesmith capabilities are amply reflected. &#8216;Satre Thirumbum&#8217; in Kalyani (Melkote-Thirunarayanapuram ) and Kandu Kali Theernden ( Thirumohur ) in a captivating Keervani are rendered very well.The percussion accompaniment by K. V. Prasad (mridangam) and the very popular ghatam artiste  S. Karthik have also   contributed to the success of the concert.The song which follows is the main piece of the kutcheri in Kambhoji, extolling the creator of the Bhagawad Geetha in the form of Parthasarathi. The kuraippu swarams and the simple korvai make for pleasant listening.  The last two compositions in a captivating Yaman Kalyani on Janardhanaswamy (Varkala) and in a highly classical Surutti on Kallazhagar (Thirumaliruncholai ) are sung with a lot of feeling.The recording is of a good quality and Vishnu bhaktas will derive immense  pleasure from this album.
