VThis time a very unusual place became the venue to listen to pure Carnatic music. The place was International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Gachibowli, where Carnatic music appreciation course is an optional subject. As part of the course,  students had learned from the basics of Carnatic music tokirtanas.They heard lectures on Carnatic music, its style,raga, talam, sruti, geetham, varnam, tillana, padam, tarangamand about great composers throughout a semester.It was for the first time that such a course was being   introduced in any technical college.  The institute also has a music club that organises concerts too.This time they chose to have a flute concert by  R.D. Phani Kumar, with  Vasudevan on violin, Kalyanaraman on mridangam and Janardan on ghatam.Phanikumar, who has a strong music foundation laid by his  mother Vani Saraswathi, continued to learn  from T. Kameswara Rao and others. He displayed a good sense for melody and developed scholarly  skills that give us a pleasing feel  of the instrument.This was revealed right in the opening numberAbhogi varnam,Evari Bodhana, which he played in three speeds. He then played the popular invocatoryVatapiinHamsadhwani.ThePanchartna kirtanaof ThyagarajaSadhinchene ManasainArabhientertained his audience well, especially when he was playing the lineSamayaniki Tagu Maatalaadi.Then cameDurmargacharainRanjani(Adi talam).  The main number of the evening wasBhavanuthainMohana.He built it well in a disciplined manner and kept the  melodic element.  Theswaraakalpanahe presented in this was a chain ofragaslikeKapi, Malayamarutham, Hindola, Rasikapriyaand back toMohana.The percussionists enhanced the impact of the number with an interestingtani avartanam. The end pieces included an English note akin toSankarabharanamand a popularbhajan, Om Jaya Jagadeesha Hare.G. S.Bottom Template Starts
