VKanyakumari and her disciple, Embar Kannan, gave an outstanding violin duet in chaste and classical style at the September season of music held under the aegis of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore, marked by full of melodic expressions, raga bhava, aesthetics and vidwat.The melodic charm they breathed into the compositions and alapanas with the sweet tonal quality of their instruments etched into the minds of the rasikas.&#8216;Neranammithi&#8217; varnam in Kanada as a kick-starter was played at a frenzied pace.The following &#8216;Mooladharamoorthey&#8217; in Hamsadhwani was brisk with an interesting exchange of swaras.The grandiose rendition of &#8216;Ksheerasagara Sayana&#8217; (Devagandhari) was superb with full of bhava and devotion. The enchanting sancharas and karvais in the alapanas of Kalyanavasantham for &#8216;Sri Venkatesam&#8217; and Harikhambhodi for &#8216;Dinamani Vamsa&#8217; brought alive the elegance and inherent melody of the ragas. The way the guru-sishya duo exchanged the raga and swaras in for this kriti was an  enjoyable aspect of the kutcheri. The lighter session featured numbers such as &#8216;Maalai Varum Velai&#8217; (Punnagavarali), &#8216;Koovi Azhaithal&#8217; (Valaji) and &#8216;Muralidhara Gopala&#8217; (Maand). Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and Sridhar (ghatam) were quick and alert to avail of the vigour of the violinists during accompaniment and thani.Sudha Raghunathan&#8217;s vocal concert on the concluding day was on predictable lines. She displayed her expertise at the picturisation of ragas and intelligibly well-organised swaras. She began with the Dharu varnam, &#8216;Maathe Malayadhwaja&#8217; in Khamas with fervour. &#8216;Sree Mahaganapathe&#8217; in Abhogi rendered with bhava and interesting combinations of swaras whetted the appetite of the rasikas. Her alapana of Lalitha was a steady stream of melodious music employing prayogas with all possible phrases to give a fantastic colour. The kalapramanams and the swaras for the niraval at &#8216;Ninnuvina&#8217; for the kriti, &#8216;Nannubrovu Lalitha&#8217; commanded the attention of the listeners. The delineation of Kharaharapriya using akara and brighas in the tara sthayi with a comprehensive middle octave was highlighted with care by the vocalist. She did full justice to &#8216;Chakkaniraja&#8217; and her delivery dropped manna in the ears. Her intense saadhakam was evident in the way she used the tara sthayi shadjam and the fluent prayogas in the alapanas. Embar Kannan&#8217;s raga portrayals [on the violin] were exhilarating. The vocalist was well supported by S.Skandasubramanian (mridangam) and Raman (morsing) in the laya wing.
