VSenior disciples of the late  M.L.Vasanthakumari,  Nirmala Srinivasan and  Meena Subramaniam, and students of the MLV Arts Academy offered shraddhanjali to their Guru  at the Sastha Hall on Tiruchi Road.   Nirmala Srinivasan recalled her tutelage und\u000aer the veteran musician and sang the compositions popularised by her guru.The students of the academy  also gave aesthetically gratifying renditions. The disciples included tiny tots, who were  eager  to display what they had learnt  from their teacher Meena Subramaniam.Senior musicians of the city, Kannan Brothers (C.V.Kannan and C.V.Sivaramakrishnan) were felicitated.  The guruvandana celebration was inaugurated by  Sundaresan who rendered some songs to the accompaniment of Kovai Balu on the violin and Suresh on the ghatam.Ranjani and Gayathri regaled the rasikas  at their kutcheri held under the aegis of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts here.With voices attuned to refined musical sensibilities, their tidy presentation of rich traditional inputs enraptured the listeners on cloud nine. They  commenced with an exquisite presentation of Kalyani varnam, &#8216;Vanajakshi,&#8217; in vilamba and durita kaalams setting the ambience to sustain the melodic levels.  &#8216;Balambikaya&#8217; in Kanada was rendered in an unhurried kalapramana.Ranjani&#8217;s alapana of Harikhambodi for the kriti, &#8216;Undedhi Ramudu&#8217; well-aligned to sruti was studded with lovely sangatis.  The niraval was reflective of the grandeur of the sahitya.Cruising through the Bhairavi alapana with sedate musical phrases,  Gayathri emerged with a clear-cut picture of the raga swaroopa for the song, &#8216;Raksha Bettare&#8217;.The highlight of the concert was the RTP in Ranjani (tisra triputa khanda nadai) shared between the siblings. While the core of the prayogas forming the strong base was laid by Ranjani up to the madhyama sthayi, Gayathri&#8217;s reign in the tara sthayi built a shimmering edifice through a spell of impassioned voice modulation.The Tukaram abhang at the end was a fitting finale soaked in melody. Baskar on the violin lived up to the  challenging demands of the vocalists in the alapanas and swara sallies.Subramaniam (mridangam) and Sridhar (ghatam) displayed exemplary precision and control in their laya exercise.
