VThe fifth day of the six-day festival of music, dance and drama organised by Visakha Music and Dance Academy saw the honouring of the living legend on flute, Padma Vibhushan Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia at the Kalabharathi auditorium. Visakha Academy felicitated the maestro with the national eminence award instituted by it in 2002 at a special function.Visakha&#8217;s president C.S.N. Raju delivered the felicitation address. Giving details of the award, he stated that it carries the title Naada/Natya Vidya Bharathi, a citation, aswarna kamalam, silk clothes and a cash award of Rs.1 lakh. The chief guest of the evening, Sadguru Sivananda Murty, conferred the title Naada Vidya Bharathi.The flute recital by the Hariprasad Chaurasia that followed turned out to be a bonanza of melody, extracted with scholarly command from the structure of raga and laya of Indian classical music. He also exhibited his mastery over the instrument, exploiting all its melodic attributes and striking a fine balance in technique.With his alaps and jods in different gathis (four, five and three matraka teeka), especially in Yaman, Jog, Gorakh Kalyani, Kousini and Pahadi, he brought to the fore the splendour of three (Kalyan with stress on Sudh Madhyam, Bilaval and Khamaj) out of the ten thaats (Melakarthas) into which Hindusthani music explicatively stands classified scientifically.Hariprasad Chaurasia was supported by Vijay Ghate on the tabla, Bhavani on the pakwaj, and Sunil Avachit on another flute.
