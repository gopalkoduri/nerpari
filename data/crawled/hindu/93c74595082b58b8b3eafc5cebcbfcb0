VThe Charlie Porter Quartet from New York performed to a packed audience in Kochi. The jubilant mix of improvisational, innovative and thrilling jazz music did not fail to move the listeners, even those who were new to jazz.The camaraderie among the quartet comprising Charlie Porter (trumpet), Adam Birnbaum (pianist), Scott Ritchie (double bass) and Jon Wikan (drums) elevates their music to another plane. This was seen in &#8216;Passing time,' where the performers took turns in proving their mettle. It was a show of exhilarating spontaneity and verve.Porter urged the quiet crowd to be more active and then the audience started cheering wholeheartedly. The jazz standard &#8216;Night in Tunisia' by Dizzy Gillespie had oscillating chord changes and some fabulous drumming from Wikan.The band took the audience by surprise by introducing a song which they said &#8216;took shape in this country.' And then came Rahman's &#8216;Jai ho' composition that pepped up the listeners.Local flavourA local flautist Ashok Koshy gave a zippy version of Hamsadhwani, which was jazzed up by Porter. The whole piece was improvisational given the fact that the two had just briefly met before the programme.Another riveting piece was with Kochi's own rocker George Peter who was performing for the first time with a jazz band. Peter gave jazzy versions with impromptu lyrics and even did a jig to &#8216;Kuttanadan punjayile.'Some wonderful syncopation from Porter and Birnbaum marked another jazz standard &#8216;I Love You.' The bassist got his due as Scott Ritchie got to play many solo strains through this piece that won him applause from the audience.Through the slow dulcet strains of &#8216;Three Two' was created a mysterious eerie mood. This was in stark contrast to &#8216;Urgency,' the catchiest number of the evening. Towards the middle of the piece, one got a true flavour of the bebop style with some wonderful swung notes.Foot-tappingThe Louis Armstrong classic &#8216;When the saints go marching in' brought some of the audience to their feet and they danced to popular number while Porter serenaded the audience by walking in their midst.The band concluded with the Indian national anthem. The event at Gokulam Convention Center was organised by the United States consulate to promote jazz music.
