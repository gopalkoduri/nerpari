VHe enlivened the concert with this composition, which celebrates the grandeur of the Goddess,  the essence of &#8216;Omkara.&#8217; A detailed alapana of Hamsadhwani heralded the arrival of &#8216;Vathapi Ganapathim.&#8217;The marked influence of his mentor was evident in his tonal variations, swara essays and raga elaborations.   &#8216;Neesari neeve ranga&#8217; in Hindolam was sung after a neat expressive portrayal of the raga.A Pantuvarali alaapana was enriched by  brigas and the highlight was the sruthibhedam (raga digression by a shifting of tone) to Mohanam on the Gandharam and to Shudha Dhanyasi on the Rishabham. After the Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Ninnanera nammi nanura&#8217; in Roopaka tala, he summed up the composition with ragamalika swaras in Kalyani, Nata Bhairavi, Hamsanadam and Vasantha. This was effectively reproduced  by Edapally Ajith on the violin.Percussion with Njanjil Arun on the mridangam and Thripunithura Radhakrishnan on the ghatom rose to the expected level of excellence but it was a trifle too long.Many of Sharath&#8217;s own light music compositions were sung during the last lap  of the concert, much to the displeasure of some in the  audience.&#8216;Pranathosmi Guruvayupuresham&#8217; (Reethigowla), &#8216;Sreeragamo&#8217; were some such songs. &#8216;Mamangam palakuri&#8217; (Abhogi) and Ravinchura (a Tyagaraja kriti in raga Samposhini) were received well. Kayaragamalika, the final piece, was an exercise in Sruthibhedam, the subsequently occurring ragas such as Kalyani, Sankarabharanam, mohanam and Hindolam achieved with the tricky tonal shift.Sharath&#8217;s concert was organised under the auspices of Bank Employees&#8217; Arts Movement.
