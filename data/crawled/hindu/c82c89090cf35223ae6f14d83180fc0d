VWith  veterans such as T.K.Govinda Rao and Rama Ravi as her guides, Lakshmi Sreeram entertained the non-stop floating audience of Sravanam at the Tirumala-Tirupati  Devasthanam. Lakshmi&#8217;s slightly husky voice carries a definite charm in the middle and lower registers but turns slightly brittle in the higher notes at times.   She presented the ragas Surutti and Latangi making a perfect bouquet of vibrant shades from both.The initial part of the concert alternated between fast and slow numbers, including &#8216;Sarasooda&#8217;  (Saveri), &#8216;Vara Narada Narayana&#8217;  (Vijayashri), &#8216;Kanchadalaya Dakshi&#8217;  (Kamala Manohari) with a pack of tepid swaras before setting focus on Surutti.Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Govinda Rajaya Namasthe&#8217; was mounted on effectively with niraval swaras at &#8216;Devaki Sukumaraya.&#8217; &#8216;Venkata Saila Vihara&#8217; in Hamir Kalyani might have given Lakshmi  a little relaxation in her other style. Her  exposition of Latangi navigated through free-wheeling phrases  setting afloat the fine texture of the melody, avoiding hyperboles. &#8216;Aparadha Mula&#8217; by Patnam Subramania Iyer being the choice, Lakshmi watchfully piled up the layers of nirval at &#8216;Vega Nannu Brova&#8217; followed by rounds of kalpanaswara.While Lakshmi could synthesise the raga phrases organically through stronger bonds, her swara chains were loosely connected because of weak and tentative links. Smart perception in this area will help  her   present a delightful blend of rolling swaras.Young violinist Arunachala Karthick&#8217;s  understanding of Lakshmi Sreeram&#8217;s style of singing was quite laudable. Karthick summed up the ragas with  quick, slow and swirling phrases in the right proportion,  and gave perfect swara sallies. Kumbakonam Swaminathan added charm to the concert with his measured beats and memorable thani avartanam.&#8216;Enna Solli Azhaithal&#8217; in Kanada, &#8216;Niravadhi Sukhada&#8217; in Ravichandrika, &#8216;Devadi Deva&#8217; in Sunada Vinodini, &#8216;Deva Devam Bhaje&#8217; in Hindolam, &#8216;Ksheerabthi&#8217; in Kurinji completed the list.
