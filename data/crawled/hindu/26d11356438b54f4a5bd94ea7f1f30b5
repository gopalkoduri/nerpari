VThe aesthetically appealing Rudra veena emanated music that touched us like the soothing zephyr on an early summer evening at Saptaparni amphitheatre. It was a privilege to listen to Ustad Bahauddin Dagar of the Dagar gharana who specialises in the Drupad. This tough classical genre mostly given up for the more exhibitive khayal is being preserved and practised by few musical families.The Rudra veena seemed to thaw in the hands of the Ustad as he opened his alaap in Yaman in a slow tempo. The elaborate alaap with micro tonal ornamentations ( gamaka) was brought out with glass-like finesse. The recurrent set pattern of syllables (akin to Carnatic tanam) were slow, deliberate giving way to melodic development as it gathered acceleration in the jhor. The pakawaz which had to pulsate with this rhythm was somehow sounding a rather discordant note. The percussionist seemed like a solo in good swing and did not amalgamate as should have with the Rudra Veena. Undeterred by any external disturbance, the Ustad went on entirely engrossed in his musical outpour.A very lengthy Yaman later came the Jog where the Ustad explored the finest of fine nuances of the raag. His meendkari (gliding from one syllabic note to the other in sheer artistry) was something to marvel. His expertise came to the fore striking at the shadj in the upper octave endowing it with a superfine richness.Drupad is essentially modal and monophonic and more so, on an instrument. The ustad could have established a rapport with his audience by looking up at them or interspersing his lengthy recital with educative briefing at least for a minute. But for a small introduction at the beginning and towards the end, there was no eye contact and created a communicative chasm between the artist and viewer/listeners. However, the sheer regard for such a divine instrument and musician, they remained mute spectators.
