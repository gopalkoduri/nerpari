VA brief Nattakurinji preceded the beautiful composition from &#8216;Nandanar Charitram&#8217; (&#8216;Vazhi maraithirukude&#8217;).The singer has to rediscover the richness of the existing samvadithvam (consonance) of this enchanting raga. The beauty of such compositions do not merely lie in their sangatis but in the lyrical beauty and the context.The brisk alapana of Shanmukhapriya was well presented (&#8216;Bhavasagara&#8217;-Adi-Papanasam Sivan). The kalpanaswaras rolled into interesting adukku swaras with ease. Padma Shankar&#8217;s rendition of the ragam had satin smooth finish, characteristic of the great school to which she belongs. The neatly hemmed kalpanaswaras added lustre to the piece.The highlight of the recital was Madhyamavati (&#8216;Ramakathasudha&#8217;-Adi-Tyagaraja). The neatly packed niraval phrases brought forth the raga bhava. Padma&#8217;s accompaniment in the lower octave which suited Sankari&#8217;s voice quality deserves special mention.The mridangam (Sherthalai R. Ananthakrishnan) must be commended for the meaningful accompaniment. The brilliant highlights of the kanjira (K.V.Gopalakrishnan) added beauty to the overall performance.Voice culture is indeed more than mere craftsmanship. It is rather an important facet of one&#8217;s own musical insight. Making these both come together is a lifetime endeavour indeed! Sankari is rightly moving in that direction.
