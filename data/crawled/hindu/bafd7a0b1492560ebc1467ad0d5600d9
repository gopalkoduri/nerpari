VThe dais was a compelling Kunnakudi beckon. With foreheads adorned in vermillion, the entire pakkavadya group of Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan &#8211; including his 50-year associate, Raja Ram on the tambura - was present at the Ramothsava Celebrations of R\u000aama Seva Mandali, Chamarajpet, Bangalore, to accompany vocalist Kunnakudi Subbalakshmi Natesan (Vaidyanathan&#8217;s sister) and Aparna and Mithun Srinivas (violin students) who presented several kritis in separate concerts in memory of the violinist. It was a Kunnakudi-family union too to receive the felicitations.Vaidyanathan was known for his unique approach in retaining a fixed group of pakkavadya artistes who have been his associates for nearly five decades. Modesty and simplicity was the hallmark of the musical family; one could see it in Subbalakshmi Natesan too. &#8220;We both used to take lessons from my father Ramaswamy Shastrigal. I only remember my prankster brother who used to be in-and-out of the lessons and in spite of his playful attitude perform better than me and my elder sister,&#8221; recalled the 78-year-old Subbalakshmi after her concert. &#8220;Our family get-togethers were totally musical because among us siblings, two of us were vocalists, with a violinist and mridangist.&#8221; Kalyani and Todi raga being  the family favourites, they were taken up for brief sketches in her concert after which kritis such as &#8220;Dayamaado Ranga&#8221; and &#8220;Sanatana Parama Pavana&#8221; came along with much gusto that the Kunnakudi school is known for. Kunnakudi&#8217;s heavy-bow techniques and the sound-and-fury passionate amalgam came through with fanfare in Mithun Srinivas and Aparna&#8217;s violin duet. Taking the signature Kunnakudi school across was what the young musicians were proving with &#8220;Telisi Rama Chintana&#8221; in Poornachandrika, and what a memory-brought-alive it was to hear the stamp of the maestro in the fast-paced chittaswara! &#8220;Our Guru taught us with his vocal lessons, not with his violin, we grasped his technique observing him play on other occasions,&#8221; said Aparna. &#8220;I would say his approach was different in every aspect of his life,&#8221; said K.V.Srinivasan, Vaidyanathan&#8217;s son. He was one man who could play for a sabha audience and gallery , and that explains his 200 concerts a year!&#8221;Kunnkudi&#8217;s interest in new attempts and innovations led him to work with veteran thavil vidwan Valayapatti Subramanian, who had 3,000 shows together. &#8220;My father gained consciousness after 25-days in the hospital after my brother&#8217;s Bhairavi rendition,&#8221; recalls Srinivasan, even as he talks of keeping alive the active work of the maestro&#8217;s Raga Research Centre on health aspects.&#8220;Karnataka is dear to me, Chowdiah appreciated me as much as Mannina Maga Rajkumar who was my great friend&#8230;&#8221; the words of the maestro will keep ringing,  even as his unorthodox bowing will always be kept afresh by the Kunnakudi Sangeetha Gurukulam.
