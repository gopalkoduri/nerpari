VSouth Indian Cultural Association chose highly qualified musicians for its five-day music festival marking its Golden Jubilee celebrations presented at Ravindra Bharati. A  violin soloist of international fame A.Kanyakumari opened the festival with h\u000aer talented disciple M.R.Kannan by her side, who served almost like an accompanist.It was a pleasure to watch her produce pure notes with sonorous sounds.The breezy spells that we watched in herswaraprastharain the main Kharaharpriya (Chakkani Raja Margamu) number was like a rhythmic fountain giving enough exercise to percussion artistes J.Vaidyanathan on mridangam and Vaikkam Gopalakrishnan on ghatam.Second violinist Kannan added his own skills in all the structures ofraga, never disturbing her solo appeal.Their violins had contrasting appeal.While it was melodic play in Kanyakumari&#8217;s recital, Kannan added his own virtuous skills, with sharp notes. Kanyakumari&#8217;s repertoire was a mix of popular and not-so-popular compositions and brought a refreshing look to her concert.The concert opened with Abhogi Varnam, which Kanyakumari performed in two speeds, following it with an invocation to Ganapathi &#8211;Moolaadhara Ganapathi, lord of obstacles, in Hamsadwani.Then she playedEndaro Mahanubhavuluin raga Sri, a Pancharatanakirtanaof Thygaraja.She maintained contrast betweenswaraandsahitya.The next number was a rarely heard composition of DikshitarSri VenkatesaminragaKalayana Vasantham, with a brief sketch of the raga.She took up, as a bit of relief, a brisk numberSobhillu Saptaswarain Jaganmohini.Yedayya Gati, a rare composition of Kotiswarayyar was her choice in this.Brochevarevarurain Khamas, a popular number of Mysore Vasudevacharya created right atmosphere to go for the main essay of the evening Kharaharapriya. Theswarasets in all the three octaves were a treat, which gave breezy and rare patterns with the percussionists building the appeal of this number.The Tani Avartanam display between the percussionists was by itself a treat and the people who walked out at that time were unfortunate in missing it.The latter part of the concert had Kanaka Dasasar&#8217;sragamalikanumber,Muddugare Yasodain Kuranji of Annamacharya and the Ranjaniragamalikanumber comprising of Ranjani, Sriranjani, Sivaranjani and Janaranjani.On the next day T.V.Sankara Narayanan figured in the concert accompanied by his son Mahadevan, who gave his own vocal support to his father.  It was a display of Sankara Narayanan&#8217;s vocal mastery all through.He opened his repertoire with aslokamon Ganesha and went on presenting with a Nataraga varnam.A Naryana Teertha&#8217;s Tarangamin in Darbar and the popularGynamosagaradain Poorvikalyani preceded by aragaessay that brought its flavour all through the rendition.Sarasa Samadana,a quickie in Kapinarayani was quite relishing.Then, he rendered a Papanasa Sivam&#8217;s Tamil piece in Hindolam.In theswarapart, his son Mahadevan too added his own structures with melodic appeal.They were accompanied by Mysore V.Srikanth on violin, Melakaveri Balaji on mridangam and Alattur Raja Ganesh on Kanjira lent impressive support.
