VThe versatility of Lalgudi Jayaraman as a composer of orchestral music has been successfully passed on to his offspring G.J.R. Krishnan and Vijayalakshmi. Various moods of ragas are portrayed in this disc. The music is soothing and makes the listener sit up and grasp the rhythmic variations and ornamentations.The opening number titled &#8216;Dance of Rain' is aptly set in Amritavarshini. One can get the feel of the initial drizzle that leads to a heavy shower. The supporting artists on various instruments and vocals have performed to perfection. There is a brief sruti bhedam exercise in Amritavarshini, employing an anya swaram which results in raga Vasantha, conveying that spring follows the rainy season. The imaginative skills of the composer come to the fore in this segment. Kalyana Vasantham is the chosen raga for the piece named &#8216;Spirit of Butterfly.' The raga's current popularity is due to Lalgudi Jayaraman's versions of the two Tyagaraja kritis, &#8216;Nadaloludai' and &#8216;Kanuluthakani.' Krishnan who has scored the music for this number reveals his imaginative skills. &#8216;Melody of March' is majestic using raga Nattakurinji.The tonal shifts are used generously in this number, which opens to the strains of the nagaswaram with a Mallari in Gambiranattai. Vedic hymns and the blowing of the conch add to the gripping orchestration.Nilambari has the soothing lullaby phrases of &#8216;Aararo Aariraro' pleasingly vocalised by female voices. To choose a raga such as Ahiri for orchestral music requires mature musical thinking.The colours of the raga without compensating on the gamakas on which the raga thrives, come out with clarity, without any dilution in &#8216;Peek a boo magic.'Repeated for effectKosalam (71st Melakarta) is the base melody for the orchestration of &#8216;Ethereal Hues' and a raga christened as Ekantham for the piece &#8216;Ode to Solitude.' Vijayalakshmi who takes the credit for scoring the music for this piece has set the opening to repeated patterns with the notes SRGM, played on the piano.Two light ragas Brindavani and Sindhu Bhairavi are portrayed in the final numbers &#8216;Joyscapes' and &#8216;Odyssey of the Magic Carpet'.Special mention has to be made of the excellent music on the piano by Ramesh Vinayakam, which enhances the total effect of this enjoyable disc. The team of supporting artists comprises of Balasayee (flute), Padma Shankar and B. Raghavendra Rao (violin), Bhavani Prasad and Anantanarayanan (veena), Sivaramakrishnan (sitar), Durgaprasad (gottuvadyam), Injikkudi E.M. Subramaniam and Mambalam Siva (nagaswaram), U.P. Raju (mandolin), Patri Satish Kumar, Ramakrishnan and Poongulam Subramanian (mridangam), Chanderjith Ranjith (tabla), Anirudh Athreya (ganjira), Guruprasad (ghatam), Sriram Parthasarathy, Vijaya Sankar, Shilpa Gopalakrishnan and Mathangi (vocal) and Biju (keyboard and strings).
