VThe change of venue from Ahobila Mutt to Karanataka Sahitya Mandir made all the difference for  Nadabharati, especially in drawing greater audience attendance. Their concerts last week had fair attendance at the Sahitya Mandir's spacious hall. Nandakumar's Hindustani sitar and carnatic vocal by Radha Padmanabhan, drew both Hindustani and Carnatic listeners. Nandakumar is quite a popular sitarist of the twin cities and his style of presentation was quite impressive, especially in producing moreswarasand melody with pull of the strings. He presented only two numbers of which Keeravani'salaap, jodandjhalaand also a smallbandishin it took enough time, almost three quarters of an hour. This was delightful and well presented.He then went on to play aGatinVilambitandDhrut Teen Taal. Nandakumar then chose to playVaishnava JanatoinKhamajas the concluding number. He had good support from Srikant on the tabla .The major concert of the evening was that of Radha Padmanabhan, a senior vocalist. She hails from a family of musicians and scholars. She was exposed to devotional music with classical flavour right at her childhood. She became disciple of noted vocalist duo &#151;  Raman and Lakshmanan &#151;  who, in turn, were the disciples of Tiger Varadacharier, fifth generation disciple of Thyagaraja.She has specialised in rendition of Sanskritslokaswith clarity and expression and produced umpteen CDs and audiocassettes. Her recital on the evening reflected this rich backdrop of erudition, attaining a wealth of good repertoire and performance acumen. Being an experienced singer, Radha quickly won audience appreciation right with her opening numbersVenkataramanainNataandSri Bhargaviin rareMangala Kaisiki.Narasimha MamavainArabhiwas marked by skilful display ofswaraprasthara, with free flowingswaras. PavanaguruinHamsanandiwas another interesting rendition before she sang another rare piece &#151;PavanainPratapavarali.Kharaharapriya(Chakkani Rajamargamu) was her main showpiece. The elaboration has at every stage a beautiful move that was relishing. Theneravalandswarasin thekritipart added their own lustre.
