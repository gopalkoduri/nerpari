VSangeetha was accompanied on violin by Vishnubhotla Krishnaveni, Manoj Siva on mridangam and K.V. Ramakrishna on ghatam.  Starting with Surati varnam,  followed by Annamayya&#8217;sVandejagatvallabham(Hamsadhvani), andVinathasuthavahana(Jayanthasena).Her next effort was exquisite elaboration ofOkaparikokapariof Annamayya (Kharaharapriya) followed by Shyamasastri&#8217;sMaayamma(Ahiri) sedately with reposeful impact and a composition of Papanasam Sivan in Andolika. Then cameYenduko Neemanasuof Thaygaraja (Kalyani) in which the expression of Manodharma in the alapana, neravu and swaram was replete with exquisite variations in the two tempos.Then after the scintillating thani executed on mridangam by Sivan and Ramakrishna on ghatam, she resplendently renderedSudhamayi(Amruthavarshini) and rendered RTP in Saveri in Chaturasratriputa with swaram in Ragamalika comprised of Mohana, Varali and Behag going in the reverse order as well. It turned out to be a showcase of her profundity in the science of carnatic music.A Javali in Purvikalyani,Naanoduvilayathbommaya(Navarasakannada), Marathi bhajan in Maund and Dhanasri Thillana of Swathi Tirunal constituted the captivating tail-piece.
