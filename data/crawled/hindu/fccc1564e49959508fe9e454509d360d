VThe vocal concert given by O.S. Thiagarajan, the recipient of many a laurel including Sangeetha Choodamani and Sangeetha Kalasagara, at Sri Krishna Vidya Mandir, turned out to be a wholesome treat of carnatic music. He rendered it with the conviction that, by doing so he would help SPICMACAY realise its objective of promoting Indian classical music and culture among youth.His concerts were organised in the port city by the Visakhapatnam chapter of SPICMACAY. The concerts, especially the one at Vidya Mandir, was marked with a good selection, diction coupled with excellent extemporisation and a resplendent clarity and expounding expression of classicism.Accompanying him with the same disposition were M. Satyanarayana Sarma on the violin and V.V. Ramana Murty on mridangam. Thiagarajan developed an excellent rapport with the packed auditorium, as he started his recital with the explicative singing of compositions of Tyagaraja, Ganamurthe (Ganamurthy) followed byEvarani Nirnayinchirira(Devamrithavarshini), both prefixed with brief but beautiful alapanas. Then, he brought out an elaborate alapana of Lalitha (Vasantha) and chose to singSeethamma Maayammawith neravu and swaram. Immediately after he rendered an expansive expatiation ofParidaanamitchithe(Bilahari) of Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer. Both Sarma and Murthy proved to be his peers, while following and playing their turns with involvement and contributing grandeur. Thani by Murthy on mridangam, replete with a variety of gathi variations, evoked applause.
