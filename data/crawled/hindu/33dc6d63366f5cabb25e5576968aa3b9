VMadurai G.S Mani is known to be a stickler for  tradition. His disciple K.J. Chakrapani differs considerably from his mentor&#8217;s approach in choice of compositions and manodharma. This was evident in the modern compositions he chose for his concert in Kochi.Chakrapani began the concert with a brisk  &#8216;Evaribodha&#8217; varnam in Abhogi. &#8216;Jaya jaya vijaya vinayaka&#8217; in Hamsadhwani was well rendered. The Natta kriti &#8216;Saraseeruhasana priye&#8217; was well rendered. Overall, the initial renditions were treated lightly. However, tempo of the songs  and jarring percussion hampered the melodic ambience of the concert.Chakrapani has a well-toned, round voice that traverses comfortably all three scales and sancharas. G.S Mani&#8217;s composition &#8216;Ramaneeya Shanvadane&#8217; in Hamsanadam in Khanda chappu was fairly executed  along with  &#8216;Seethamma Mayamma&#8217; in raga Vasantha. The vocalist used long sustenance in the alaapana and  did not use  many intricacies. The  wholesome rendering of the raga Keeravani smoothly gave way to the composition &#8216;Sangeeta Samrajya Pradayini.&#8217;Satheesh Varma on the violin elaborated on the raga.  The few  traditional compositions Chakrapani chose to sing should, ideally, have enhanced the concert. The popular  &#8216;Nagumo mu ganale&#8217; in Abheri  was sung at an incredibly fast pace. Sadly, a composition that centres on such yearning, angst and deep meaning was trivialised to a side number. Aymakam Chandra Kumar&#8217;s mridangam did not add to the musicality of the composition.A briga-laden alaapana  preceded the elaboration of raga Latangi.   &#8216;Aparadhamulaneeyo maninchi,&#8217; a kriti of Patanam Subrahmanya Iyer, was sung with many oscillating sangatis. The thani by  Chandra Kumar and Palai Ajai on the ghatam had many enjoyable planned moments.The last lap of the concert had the film song &#8216;Navami mahanavami&#8217; set to Shankarabharanam raga. &#8216;Radhasamethakrishna&#8217; in Yamunakalyani was followed by a Shlokam in ragas Charukesi, Kalyani, Desh and Sindhu Bhairavi.  Chakrapani closed the concert with an excellent rendition of &#8216;Pratyahngirabhagavatim sada namami&#8217; in raga Nadanamakriya.   The concert  was organised by Rasikapriya.
