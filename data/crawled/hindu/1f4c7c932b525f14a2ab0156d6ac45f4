VR. Ganesh's  singing is becoming increasingly original, over the years. One of the disciples of Maharajapuram Santhanam, Ganesh sang a delectable Simmendra Madhyamam. Notably, the sprightly brigas at the upper notes showed class. `Rama Rama Guna Seema' that followed next, was neatly rendered, except for the fact that Ganesh tended to shorten the long vowels too often for comfort &#151;  `Raama' as `Rumma' and `Dhaama' as `Dhama,' condensing the `aa' vowel to half its time. This beat-delay, if done often, upsets the aesthetics. Save this, it was a brilliant rendition, replete with enchanting niraval and swaras at `Muni Maanasa Dhaama.'Earlier, Ganesh sang a neat Arabhi (`Jootamurare') of Tyagaraja. Violinist Kandadevi Vijayaraghavan and mridangist A.S.Ranganathan gave adequate support.M. RAMESHBottom Template Starts
