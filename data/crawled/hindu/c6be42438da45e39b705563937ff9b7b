VFlautists B.K. Anantharam and Amith A. Nadig presented a duet at the MES Kalavedi in Bangalore on Saturday, accompanied by R. Dayakar (violin), B.R. Sreenivas (mridanga) and C.P. Vyasavittala (khanjari).The concert began with the aditala varna in Vasantha, &#8220;Ninnu Kori&#8221; and continued with &#8220;Raghunayaka&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in Hamsadhwani, succeeded by kalpanaswaras that concluded with a few avarthanas centering around the madhya sthayi gandhara. Ramapriya was next taken up for a brief alapana that established the identity of the raga in a nutshell, followed by &#8220;Korinavara&#8221;, the Patnam Subrahmania Iyer krithi set to rupaka tala, a well-proportioned neraval, and kalpanaswaras spiced with a sprinkling of rhythmic calculations.&#8220;Niravadhi Sukhada&#8221; in Ravichandrika, which lends itself admirably to instrumental representation, was embellished with interesting melodic and rhythmic variations, which the accompanists anticipated and accentuated with gusto. However, the next raga Abhogi, also a panchama varjya raga with some identical notes, could have been preceded by another raga with a strong panchama presence for greater impact.The alapana of Abhogi was fluent and melodious, with occasional phrases alternating between the dhaivatha in the mandra and madhya sthayis, and elaboration around the rishabha in the tara sthayi. The use of a comparatively plain gandhara, with just a hint of gamaka, brought in echoes of the Hindustani style, also discernible in the violinist&#8217;s solo alapana. The Dikshithar krithi &#8220;Sreelakshmivaraham&#8221; set to adi tala was rendered with due consideration to its structural and literary merits.The main raga, Shankarabharana, was handled with much technical finesse and aesthetic appeal by the father-son duo. The initial phase up to the tara sthayi shadja was elaborated by B.K. Anantharam with leisurely rests at the gandhara and panchama. Expansive treatment with elongated pauses at the shadja and gandhara characterised Amit Nadig&#8217;s alapana in the higher register. R. Dayakar&#8217;s alapana was cast in the same mould and suffused with raga bhava.The krithi chosen for the evening was the Thyagaraja composition set to adi tala, &#8220;Swararagasudha&#8221;, which was followed by kalpanaswaras in two speeds, but did not feature a neraval.The swaras incorporated a number of rhythmic permutations and combinations that ended in some avarthanas of diminishing length with the madhya sthayi gandhara as the pivotal note. The engrossing tani avarthana revealed not only the prowess of the percussionists but also the perfect understanding between them.Though the main artistes played with absolute synchronisation, they managed to maintain a degree of individuality without detriment to the cohesiveness of the performance.The youthful effervescence of Amith Nadig, with his penchant for the occasional flourish, contrasted nicely with the mellow maturity of B.K. Anantharam. Flawless alignment to shruti, exceptional control over laya, and a pronounced stress on the sweetness of ragas and compositions were the highlights of the recital.
