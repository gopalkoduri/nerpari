VActress and director, writer and teacher, playwright and director, television anchor and screenplay writer, Sohaila Kapur seems to have mastered the art of being on two sides of the coin at once. Now she returns to the Delhi stage with one of her plays, &#8220;Mahim Junction&#8221;, which has already played to critical and popular acclaim in Britain and Singapore. Originally named &#8220;Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan&#8221;, the play, a musical in English, has been rechristened and updated by the playwright who has decided to direct it herself this time. Translated into Hindustani for its India debut, the production&#8217;s new name is primarily because a movie of the same name has already come out, and, she says wryly, she doesn&#8217;t want to be accused of plagiarising.Preparing for a preview at The Ashok&#8217;s open-air auditorium in New Delhi this Friday in an invitees-only show, she says she is using this first Delhi performance as a &#8220;testing ground&#8221; and hopes to present it at public shows in the near future. The play is being presented in association with Shekhar Kapur, Lata Bhasin and The Hungry Hearts Festival.Mumbai has been in the news for all the most tragic reasons of late, and the feisty director wonders how her play will be received in their aftermath. She describes the production, a take-off on commercial films of the 1960s and &#8217;70s, as &#8220;retro-Bollywood&#8221;, saying it is her &#8220;tribute to films of that era&#8221;. Those films, known for their melodrama and fairytale formulas, are not being parodied, the playwright clarifies. Rather, they are being celebrated.These were films that didn&#8217;t require too much thinking on the part of the viewers, she muses. &#8220;Nothing was sad or tragic or left unsaid.&#8221; So her play is basically about &#8220;the spirit of India at that time,&#8221; says Sohaila, though hesitant to use the word &#8216;spirit&#8217; in a climate when Mumbai&#8217;s spirit has been mauled both by terrorists and debaters.Strangely, the issues that preoccupy us today were present during that era, too, she notes. Communal conflicts, bomb blasts and other kinds of violence on society all find a place in the old films. &#8220;These things were there, but at least we could take them light-heartedly,&#8221; she observes. In those films, &#8220;nothing was too bald or negative,&#8221; and &#8220;people were happy when they came out of the hall.&#8221;The preview will now be presented as a tribute to the spirit of Mumbai, says Sohaila.Meanwhile, she says, her actors are &#8220;having a blast in rehearsals every day.&#8221; The young people in her group have mostly not seen the films they are parodying, and, says the director, she made them view a few to understand the ambience. &#8220;It&#8217;s a revelation for them.&#8221;Venue:The Ashok open air auditoriumDate:This FridayTicketsOnly through invitation
