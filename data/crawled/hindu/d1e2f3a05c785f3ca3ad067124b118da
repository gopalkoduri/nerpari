VNilakanta Sivan&#8217;s compositions are immediately accessible to the layman  in spite of their metaphysical import and loftiness. He was one of the prolific composers of our age &#8212; has 2000 songs against his name &#8212; was a master of dictio\u000an. The famous ones include &#8216;Anandha Nadamaduvar&#8217; (Purvikalyani), &#8216;Navasiddhi Petralum&#8217; (Kharaharapriya) and &#8216;Endraiku Sivakrupai&#8217; (Mukhari). Papanasam Sivan was to a great extent guided and influenced by Nilakanta Sivan.Baby Sriram presented a concert of Neelakantan Sivan&#8217;s compositions  under the auspices of The Music Academy. Baby&#8217;s  robust and low musical voice enhanced the depth of the compositions. The songs, mostly were set to tune by the late  T.M.Thiagarajan and  the vocalist&#8217;s reverent interpretation generated a flood of feeling. It also showed the hard work that had gone into the effort.She began with &#8216;Sri Ganapathiye&#8217; (Nattai), the other selections being &#8216;Sambu Krupai Varumo,&#8217; &#8216;Karunai Seivaye&#8217; (Sahana), &#8216;Karunai Puri Idhu Tharunam&#8217; (Varali), with a pleasurably coursed niraval and swaras at &#8216;Neelaveni, Oraru Mugane&#8217; (Ritigowlai).A virutham (&#8216;Mudi Sarndha Mannarum&#8217; - Hamsanandhi and Khamas) as a preface to &#8216;Theruvadheppo Nenje&#8217; (popularised by Pattammal) followed. The final ragamalika (&#8216;Unnai Thavira Verillai&#8217;) &#8211; a tuning effort by the singer &#8212; with eight charanams  reflected vidwat.Earlier, the Sahana raga alapana had the mesmerising touch  whereas the elaboration of Khambodi (&#8216;Velayudhane&#8217;) was absorbingly assertive and expressive with intentional and delicate pauses producing a wholesome effect.The swaras were rendered with a sense of accomplishment though the final korvai had to be left in the air for obvious reasons.Shertalai Sivakumar (violin) accompanied with gusto and verve, and set himself well during the swara exchanges. Sivaraman (mridangam) and Sundarakumar (kanjira), both eager for adventure, gave a thani loaded with multi-level and stylistic combinations.One was, however, slightly vexed with their contrived inclusion of arudis at each and every stage of the songs, without exception.
