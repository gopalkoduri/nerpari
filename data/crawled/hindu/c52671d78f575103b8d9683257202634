VC. SURESH KUMARIt was a pleasant and unique presentation ofPancharatna Kirtanasof Saint Thyagayya, by a group of women  and children at the Thyagaraja Gana Sabha mini theatre recently.  The programme was organised by Raga Sudha, Domalguda.ThePancharatna krithiswere led by C. Indira Mani along with her students. There was no show to exhibit individual superiority and was rendered in perfect rhythmic combination and most importantly there was no reference to script or books by any one of the artistes, which traits are rare to see in such group renderings ofPancharatna krithiseven by renowned artistes. The students though young need to be complimented for this and all credit goes to the teacherC. Indira Mani.To familiarise the audience with eachkrithi, each of the fivekritiswere preceded by a well written narration by C. Indira Mani. Sharmeelee Prasad, Sangeeta Ashok Kumar and Aruna Sonti were the prominent singers apart from the children. This was followed by a musical featureTirumalesuni Gaanchina Vageyakarulu, conceptualised by C. Indira Mani based on thekirtanasof Annamaya, Purandaradas, and Thyagayya. Children below age of 12 enacted thevageyakaruluand also the concerned deities aptly.The vocal support for this ballet was by Karthik, Kirthi and Spoorthi. Students of Raga Sudha, Karthik, Rohit, Abhisekh, Spoorti, Kirti and Mukund rendered few devotional songs. Earlier the programme was commenced withVishnu Sahasranamamby Sai Satsang of New Nallakunta.Bottom Template Starts
