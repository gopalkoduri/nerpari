VFlautist L.V. Mukund from Bangalore enthralled the audience with his fine artistry. Crispness in svarakalpana, clarity in svara stayis and sophisticated treatment of melody in all the three octaves were the hallmarks of the concert.Coming from the renowned Belakavadi tradition, the artiste had a fascinating breath control, which was in tune with the total structure of his music, and didn't sound like an unwanted exercise.Groomed by his mother Radha Vijayaraghavan and nurtured with a systematic training by the maestros such as Prapancham Balachandran and Dr. N. Ramani, the artiste kept up the musical heritage of the family.While ragas such as Bilahari ("Sri Chamundeswari"), Varali ("Mamava Meenakshi"), Goula ("Pranamamyaham") were exhilarating, raga "Khamboji" was at its best. Dikshitar's kriti "Subramanyaya" was meticulously articulated. This performance at the Bidaram Prasanna Sitarama Mandira under the aegis of Tyagaraja Sangeetha Sabha in memory of the flute wizard Mali (T.R. Mahalingam) had excellent support on violin by vidwan H. K. Narasima Murthy, G. S. Ramanujam on mridanga and Ramesh on mruchangi.Dance festivalNatyanjali &#151;  2005 from Kalakshetra, Chennai, will present Choodamani and Mahapattabisheka at the 29th National level Festival of Dance Dramas.Two episodes from Ramayana, choreographed by the late Rukminidevi, which had music composed by Mysore Vasudevacharya will be presented.
