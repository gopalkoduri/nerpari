VM. RAMESHSeventeen-year-old K.Dharini gave a thoroughly enjoyable concert  that underscored her precocity.Dharini has a deep voice and ample manodharma. With age on her side, there is going to be a lot more of music to be heard from the young artiste.After a warm-up varnam (Charukesi, of Lalgudi Jayaraman), and a brisk Nattai (`Pahimam'), Dharini  bedazzled her audience with a powerful Varali.It was an imaginative alapana. The liberal use of `ni-ma' combination, the long karvai on the `ma' during the alapana's descent and the slow glide of the `ri' before landing, brought forth the beauty of the raga in full.Violinist M. Rajeev, a disciple of Kanya Kumari, showed class. His raga essays matched that of the vocalist. Dharini took up Papanasanam Sivan's `Ka Va Va,' but perhaps a shade too slow that one would have liked it to be. The song was tailed by some sprightly swaras.The central piece of the concert was `Akshaya Linga Vibho,' reflecting Dharini's penchant for singing `weighty' compositions.  The Sankarabharanam alapana rang a full 12-minutes and Dharini appeared quite at ease in handling the raga.Again Rajeev answered with a fine raga sketch. Niraval and swaras came, as expected, at `Badari.' Srivanchiyam Sriram played a neat thani.Memorable concertS.P.Ramh's concert will be remembered for two factors.First, the Lalgudi disciple showed a iconoclastic tendency, singing a long ragam and tanam in Surutti as the main piece of the concert and following up with Tyagaraja's `Geetarthamu' in full, rather than singing a pallavi, and then, not singing a niraval.Considering that Ramh had time, it is surprising that he missed the niraval part. Odd, yes, but the Surutti piece made for a good listening. Second, the irate mridangist, D.A.Srinivas, paused during his thani to tell a couple of chatters at the back that their chatting was disturbing. "How can I play if you keep on talking ?" he demanded.Earlier, Ramh sang a lovely Varali alapana followed by `Ka Va Va.'Swaras came at `Pazhani Malaiyil.' The piece showed Ramh's maturity.The artiste has been getting less attention than he deserves.A.G.A.Gnanasundaram, another Lalgudi disciple, played brilliantly.The concert had a long tail, with a number of thukkadas and a tillana.Bottom Template Starts
