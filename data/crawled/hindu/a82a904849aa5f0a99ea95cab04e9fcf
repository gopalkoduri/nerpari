VIt was a scintillating flute recital rendered by Mala Chandrasekar at Rasika Ranjana sabha, Tiruchi, to commemorate the 12th anniversary of L.V. Memorial concerts.Mala  presented in her delectable rendition, the varnam Nattakurinji, travelled extensively in Hamsadhwani (&#8216;Vatapi&#8217;) and  Hindolam (&#8216;Samagana Lola&#8217;) with ease and poise, elaborated in Sahana (&#8216;Kirupai Nelakona&#8217;) and entranced the rasikas by her  mellowing performance.She enthused  the audience by rendering  rare ragas such as  Amirtha Behag (&#8216;Kamala Charane&#8217;) and Kaikavasi (&#8216;Vachama Kosarame&#8217;) in her inimitable style.Mala&#8217;s tukkada pieces such as  Bharathiyar&#8217;s &#8216;Dhikku Theriyatha Kattil&#8217; and Kalki&#8217;s &#8216;Maalai Pozhudinile&#8217; in ragamalika spoke of her erudite scholarship in the craft.Mala Chandrasekar&#8217;s niraval, apt swaraprayoga, and the lovely cadences would long be remembered.T. H. Vasantha on the violin, Salem Srinivasan on the mridangam and Krishna on the ghatam gave valuable support to this masterly and stimulating performance.Santhanagopalan mesmerised the audience with his soulful rendering of the kritis. He started of with a varnam in Vasantha followed by &#8216;Smaranasukham&#8217; in Janaranjani with brisk swaraprastaras.Oothukkadu Venkatasubbaiyar&#8217;s &#8216;Thaye Yashoda&#8217; in Thodi and Ramanathapuram Srinivasa Iyengar&#8217;s &#8216;Saraguna Palimpa&#8217; in Kedaragowla were sung gracefully with elaborate alapana, niraval and swaras.Pakkala Ramadoss&#8217;s Thodi and Kedaragowla on the violin were neat and precise and won applause. V.Rajasekaran&#8217;s mridangam along with Alathur Rajaganesh&#8217;s ganjira had a soothing effect in well preserving the mood of the vocalist.Their tani avartanam was quite engaging and won a great applause from the audience.He also rendered  &#8216;Manathirkugandadhu&#8217; in Sindhubhairavi of Thanjavur Sankara Iyer and &#8216;Ramanukku Mannan Mudi&#8217; in Hindolam of Arunachala Kavi on public demand.
