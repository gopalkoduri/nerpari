VTamil devotional - CDGeetha RajaSaReGaMa &#8211; Rs. 109SaReGaMa has  released a Tamil devotional album,  &#8216;Maalavanum Velavanum&#8217; with songs in praise of Krishna and Muruga. The lyrics and the music blend very well.  Vocalist Geetha Raja&#8217;s rendering is flawless with perfect adherence to the sruti. The diction is of a  high order.The credit for the music goes to the versatile musician, Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan.  The songs have been penned by Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan, Hema Nivas and Pudhuvayal Veerappa.The closing song in this album is an oft-heard Subramanya Bharati creation. The strong musical foundation which Geetha Raja has been provided with by  late T. Brinda has stood her in good stead and makes her renderings weighty.The songs are tastefully tuned and based on popular and lesser heard melodies.The ragas covered are Gowri Manohari, Revathi, Simhendramadhyamam, Durga, Sivaranjani, Huseini, Gopikatilakam, Desh, Chenjurutti, Sindhubhairavi, Sarasangi, Kedaram and Natabhairavi.Towards the close of the album is the verse  &#8216;Guru Brahma Guru Vishnu&#8217; which is not mentioned in the sleeve note. A good album for early morning or late night listening.
