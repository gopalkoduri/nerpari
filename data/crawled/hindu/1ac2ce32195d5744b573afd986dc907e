VThenkarai Maharajan, a disciple of Kottar Ramachandran, presented a vocal recital  at Thripunithura. The vocalist, a stickler for tradition, has a pleasing tenor and a thorough grip over laya.  His raga depiction is not marred by any ambiguity.  His style of rendition of swaras  highlights the &#8216;Maathu-Dhaathu&#8217; (relationship between lyric and notes) concept, which is the quintessence of Carnatic music.Maharajan began his concert  with a Kothavasal Venkatarama Iyer varnam (&#8216;Sarasudaa&#8217;) in Saveri.  Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Moolaadhaara Moorthy&#8217; in Hamsadwani was ornamented  with a flurry of kalpanaswaras that  tapered down aesthetically.Charmingly grouped swara segments  set up the tempo of the concert and as the recital progressed, his timbre improved.&#8216;Mookambike&#8217; in Arabhi turned out to be his own creation.  The subtle tonal variations in the rendition of  Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Teliyaleru&#8217; in Dhenuka  emphasised the message in the composition.A supple Panthuvarali was complemented by the niraval and swaras that adorned  the GNB composition &#8216;Sivananda,&#8217; set to Misra chappu.Maharajan&#8217;s liking for rare compositions culminated in  a detailed exposition of &#8216;Nin Paadham thunai,&#8217; composed by Dikshitar. &#8216;Kaavadi Chinthu,&#8217; comprising Chenchurutti, Nathanamakriya and Sahana, and &#8216;Radha Sametha,&#8217; immortalised by GNB, were some of the pieces he sang.S. Eswara Varma accompanied on the violin.  Vaikom Venugopal  and  Alappuzha G. Manoharan Nair accompanied on the mridangam and the ghatom respectively.The concert was organised under the auspices of Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha.
