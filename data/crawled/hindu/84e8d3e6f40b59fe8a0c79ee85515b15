VA disciple of Delhi-based P.N.Krishnan and Akhila Krishnan, Anirudh&#8217;s recital placed emphasis on kriti presentation with earnest projection of patanthara and clean simple lines in alapana.&#8216;Tathvamariya&#8217; (Ritigowla) and &#8216;Swaminatha&#8217; (Nattai) carried judicious rounds of kalpanaswara. Conditioned as most listeners are to &#8216;Sobillu&#8217; (Jaganmohini) being rendered at breakneck speed with a flurry of chittaswaram generating sound and fury, it came almost as a surprise and welcome relief to hear this Tyagaraja krithi rendered at a leisurely pace allowing the mind to dwell upon sahitya.The raga sketch of Sriranjani followed by Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Ini Oru Kanam&#8217; exploited the instrument&#8217;s inherent advantages in rapid passages and steady, tranquil karvais. In karvais, the artiste needs to keep a more stringent watch on sruthi alignment, though.The Kanada exposition was highlighted by sensitive touches. The kalpanaswara segment of Swathi Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Maamava Sada Janani&#8217; captured flavour through easy flow and apt poruttams centred at the rishabha, stressing the eduppu at the opening line.Shadja-varja and panchama-varja passages were carried off with flair in the main raga Kalyani, which would have benefited from the inclusion of more time-tested pidis and a tighter framework. The kriti was Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Etavunara.&#8217;Other kritis included Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Chinna Nade&#8217; (Kalanidhi) and Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar&#8217;s &#8216;Neekelana&#8217; (Devamanohari). K.P.Nandhini&#8217;s accompaniment was marked by burgeoning maturity. Her Kalyani alapana scored with free-flowing sancharas strengthened by swaroopa-reinforcing pidis at the gandhara in the middle and upper registers. N.C.Bharadwaj&#8217;s sure touch and strong sollus on the mridangam anchored kalapramana with consistency.
