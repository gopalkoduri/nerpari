VThe hype created before her music was justified by the quality fare Aruna Sairam offered  at her thematic concert (Oothukkadu Venkatakavi compositions) at the September season of music under the aegis of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore. From the  o\u000apening &#8216;Sree Vighnarajam Bhaje&#8217; served with verve, rhythm and beat the audience swayed to the offering. Her huge rasika base required additional chairs along the aisle of the spacious auditorium.The melodic content and performance vigour struck an instant rapport with the listeners. The intensity of her expression in the following &#8216;Udajagopasundara&#8217; (Umabharanam) was deep. Her nuances in the Ritigowlai alapana for the kriti, &#8216;Enna Punniyam Seideno&#8217; and Kiravani for the song, &#8216;Balasarasamurali&#8217; gave shape to her manodharma casting a spell on the audience especially in the tara sthayi.After a sober rendition of &#8216;Naadamurali Gaana Vilola&#8217; in Hamirkalyani, her charming Thodi alapana for &#8216;Thaye Yasoda&#8217; was replete with mellifluous sancharas awakening the rakti making the song dignified.The roller-coaster swaras for the kriti demonstrated her intense saadhakam. The songs towards the end revealed the artist&#8217;s devotion and total commitment.Embar Kannan&#8217;s sweet-toned solo versions of Hamsanadham, Ritigowlai and Thodi were expressed in lyrical idioms with classical dignity.The percussive rhythms of Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and Sridhar (ghatam) enhanced the dignity of the kutcheri. Their thani was a soporific exchange with simple nadai variations.Sowmya&#8217;s asura saadhakam over the years helps her to reveal the beauty of music in her own style.  Her performance  breathed the melody and beauty of Carnatic music. The sowkyam in her music took the rasikas to dizzy heights. Her opening &#8216;Kanakaangi&#8217; Ata tala varnam in Thodi was dignity personified. &#8216;Parvatharajakumari&#8217; (Sriranjani) sung with passion and involvement took the Kutcheri to melodic level. Her sensitively envisioned sancharas brought out the radiance of Ataana for the kriti, &#8216;Ye Paapamu&#8217;of Tyagaraja.Her portrayal of Narayanagowlai (a favourite raga of her guru) was well nurtured with a felicitous flow of sancharas for the song, &#8216;Gadale Vaadu.&#8217; The highlight of the kutcheri was the RTP in Rasikapriya.The listeners could enjoy every turn and twist of the raga sancharas of Sriramkumar in his solo versions on the violin. Arun Prakash (mridangam) and Purushothaman (ganjira) gave shape to their percussive impulses suitably.The jugalbandi of Sriram Parasuram and Anooradha Sriram  demonstrated the duo&#8217;s mastery over both the Carnatic and Hindustani styles of music. The songs presented in the programme, with vivid explanations, were an enriching experience.  The opening &#8216;Sarasuda&#8217; varnam in Saveri was compared and contrasted with the Hindustani Sahana Kanada.A festive kind of lyric, &#8216;Swami Ezhai Naan,&#8217; euologising a wedding was enriched by a lucid interpretation. The padam, &#8216;Edhaikkandu Nee Ichchai Kondai,&#8217; sung by Anooradha after an elaborate alapana in Kalyani was compared to Hindustani Yaman. Then followed a drut kayal, &#8216;Ayire Milanathore.&#8217; Sreeram&#8217;s alapana of Malkauns to show its similarity with Hindolam for the kriti, &#8216;Saamajavaragamana&#8217; revealed the artist&#8217;s sense of history and sensitivity to the subtleties and nuances of the language. The Thumri-Pahadi, &#8216;Rangi Saari Gulabhi Chunari Yare&#8217; was a soulful rendition.V.V.Sreenivasa Rao (violin), Umakanth Purani (Harmonium), Sudhindra (mridangam) and Kesav Joshi (tabla) were the accompanists.Gayathri Girish&#8217;s confident delivery of kirtanas at the September season of music and dance revealed her commitment to the essential values of classical music.After a lively rendition of &#8216;Chalamela&#8217; varnam in Naattakurinji and &#8216;Sambho Mahadeva&#8217; (Bowli), her Ritigowlai alapana was alluring with her tonal suppleness.Her raga exploration of Simhendramadhyamam was neatly chiselled with vadi samvadi phrases and brighas for the composition, &#8216;Ninne Nammithi.&#8217;Her relaxed raga vinyasam of Nattakurinji in RTP was a neat execution. &#8216;Swagatham Krishna&#8217; (Mohanam) and &#8216;Brihadambikayai Namasthe&#8217; (Vasantha) were the other items of the fare. The tukkadas towards the end served as snacks to the rasikas.Charumathi&#8217;s solo versions of the ragas and swara passages were refined in taste. Manoj Siva (mridangam) and Guruprasad (ghatam) distinguished themselves by their laya expertise and thani.Sankari Krishnan structured her concert  on the strength of songs like &#8216;Sivaloka Naadhanai Kandu&#8217; (Mayamalavagowlai) with swaras and &#8216;Budhamaashrayami&#8217; (Nattakurinji).Her Madhyamavathi alapana was flooded with a stream of mellifluous phrasings for the kriti, &#8216;Brihannayaki Nannubrova.&#8217;The delineation of Purvikalyani raga for &#8216;Thillai Chidambaramenru&#8217; dripped with honeyed prayogas.The alapana of Kharaharapriya contained all the formula sancharas for the composition, &#8216;Chakkaniraja.&#8217; The niraval at &#8216;Kantiki&#8217; and the following swara passages struck a chord with the rasikas.The RTP in Shanmukhapriya, misra jampai, sankeerna nadai created an impression of her care for grammar.Akkarai Subbulakshmi&#8217;s effortless and melodious violin and the vibrant percussion support from Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and Sridhar (ghatam) complemented the concert.Despite their not-so-very-comfortable saareeram in the higher octaves, the duo, Suguna Purushothaman and Suguna Varadachari, vocalists belonging to the the vintage tradition of Musiri Subramania Iyer,  chose  compositions that stood out for their emotive substance. Well aligned to sruthi, their opening varnam in Khamas, &#8216;Enthaninne&#8217; with four charanams was soaked in aesthetics. The alapana of Ramapriya for &#8216;Korina Varamu&#8217; by Suguna varadachari and Khambodi for &#8216;Sree Subramanyaya Namasthe&#8217; by Suguna Purushothaman laid emphasis on diligent sancharas and sampradaya prayogas linked to the moorchanas making sure of their effectiveness. Akkarai Subbulakshmi could easily anticipate the minds of the vocalists and her wholesome cooperation in the niraval and swara passages drew applause. The thani from Ramabadran (mridangam) was a tame affair.His penchant for brigas and high flown exaggerated sancharas in raga expositions could be seen in Sanjay Subramaniam&#8217;s vocal recital at the September season of music and dance in the Rajalakshmi Fine Arts.Despite absence of sowkhyam, the artist&#8217;s erudite expository method in imparting authentic quality to his interpretations endeared him to the rasikas.The opening Kedaram song followed by &#8216;Ra Rama Inti&#8217; (Asaveri) embellished with swaras revealed his total involvement with the aesthetics of the ragas.The raga portrayals of Purvikalyani for &#8216;Ekamranaadham,&#8217; Nalinakanti for &#8216;Madhavapaalaya&#8217; and Sankarabharanam for &#8216;Entukubethala,&#8217; each different in mood and presentation, showed his dynamic imagination and his interpretation of the compositions was overweening. His acrobatic improvisation of mega swaraprastharas following the feisty niraval for the kriti, &#8216;Entukubethala,&#8217; matched the grandeur of the composition. &#8216;Nannu Vidachi&#8217; (Ritigowlai) and &#8216;Vidajala&#8217; (Janaranjani) were brisk renditions sans gimmickry. The RTP in Sivaranjani in tisra triputa gave full scope to the vocalist&#8217;s manodharma.In every phrasing of Vinu&#8217;s solo versions of the ragas on the violin, there lurked the joy of oozing raga bhava dressed in honeyed warmth. The rasikas could feel the rapture of every turn of the raga sancharas. The percussive efforts of Satish Kumar (mridangam) and Srisundarkumar (ganjira) were  in line with the vocalist&#8217;s thoughts.
