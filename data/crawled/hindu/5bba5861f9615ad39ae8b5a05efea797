VIt was an altogether a different evening at Tagore Hall in Srinagar recently when, amid dazzling performance of young Kashmiri singers and dancers, the first ever Hindi-Punjabi album from Jammu and Kashmir State was launched.Titled "Sukoon", it was released by Omar Abdullah, who termed it as a treat for music lovers. The young Kashmiri artistes, both boys and girls, surprised everyone with their performance and kept the audience in jam-packed hall spell bound for more than two hours.Sheikh Arafat, son of Kashmir's popular singer the late Ghulam Nabi Sheikh, led the team. Mehmeet Sayed, a young female voice mesmerised the audience with a Kashmiri number `Rum Gayem Sheeshas' and `Rangeela O Rangeela'. Her debut album in Kashmir was released recently."It was really a pleasant evening which Kashmir has been missing for long," said Shaista, a young graduate.The hall was filled with young boys and girls drawn from different colleges of the city. The hero of the evening was Kingpaul Singh, whose "Sukoon" was released on the occasion. It was the maiden presentation of Amit Vanchoo Infotainment Division (AVID) a Srinagar-based company. "Sukoon" has some nice songs like `Asa Teri Gal' and `Kajra Kajra'."I never could imagine that Punjabi-Hindi mix could be so popular in Kashmir where Kashmiri music has a strong constituency," says Kingpaul, who hopes to make it to the national scene, but meanwhile, "I am thrilled with the response from my fans here". An arts graduate Kingpaul is planning to continue his studies along with the performance.SHUJAAT BUKHARIBottom Template Starts
