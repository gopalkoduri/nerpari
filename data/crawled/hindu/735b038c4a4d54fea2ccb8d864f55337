VAll the songs carried the purity of purpose she held in view. Though not backed up by a facile voice, she could give a sense of composure without much ado by way of assertiveness. There was vocal balance between the swift and the measured madhyamakala pace. Though appearing to be simple, there was sufficient depth, a mark of maturity.The songs &#8212; &#8220;Nee Daya Che Rama&#8221; (Yadukula Khambodi), &#8220;Nannu Vidichi&#8221; (Ritigowla), &#8220;E Varamadu Gudura Sri Rama&#8221; (Kalyani) &#8212; in particular reflected the essence of Tyagaraja culture. This segment of the concert was uplifting with a good mix of will and skill. The two raga alapanas of Ritigowla and Kalyani laid stress on meticulous sancharas linked to the moorchanas ensuring effectiveness.The very first Yadukula Khambodi item sounded the quality status of the concert firmed up by the next song, &#8220;Muddu Momu&#8221; in Suryakantam. The quick rendering of Begada kirtana, &#8220;Bhaktuni Charithram&#8221; was in the nature of prelude to the elaborately presented Madhyamavati alapana and song &#8220;Ram Katha Sudha&#8221;. Karvais and sancharas were directed to the sharpness of the raga&#8217;s picture. In all these efforts the contribution of the violinist Shertalai Sivakumar was modest. Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar (mridangam) was scrupulous in percussive support.
