VOne of the great saints that\u000aCarnatic music field can\u000anever forget is Purandara\u000aDasa (1484-1564), who laid\u000ateaching technique of the\u000astyle from `Sarali swaras',\u000achoosing Mayamalava Gowla\u000aas his basic scale.Most of the vocalists add a\u000anumber or two of Purandara\u000aDasa in their repertoire. Nada\u000aBharathi organised a concert\u000aat Mahati Hall, D.D.\u000aColony recently by Jayamani\u000aNarasimhan. She was accompanied\u000aby young musicians\u000aN.C. Anantha Krishna on violin\u000aand P. Srinivasa Gopalan\u000aon mridangam.Special numbersShe chose some special\u000anumbers of the saint and also\u000aadded one or two compositions\u000aof other greats on this\u000aoccasion.Jayamani opened with a\u000aslokam in Dharmavathi and\u000asang Guru Purandara as a\u000atribute to the saint, with rare\u000asangathis brightening up the\u000araga. Indu Dayamado Ranga\u000ain Kalyanavasantham with a\u000ascintillating Swarakaplana\u000awas an instant hit.A slokam in Brindavanasaranga\u000awhich she used for an\u000aextensive presentation of the\u000abeauties of the raga followed.And she sang a composition\u000aof the same lyrical texture\u000aof the earlier number in\u000aAdi talam. The swarprasthara\u000atoo was vivid.The delineation of raga\u000aVasantha indeed was an experience\u000aof beauty. Vade\u000aVenkatadri of Annamacharya\u000awas her chosen number\u000ain this that was rendered\u000awith perfect Sahityabhava.Her main essay of the concert\u000awas Bhairavi, a soulful\u000amelody from her with perfect\u000aragabhava.This presentation was something\u000adifferent from what\u000awe heard from others and\u000awas reflective of her great\u000a`vidwat'.Purandardasa's Oodi Bharoo\u000aVaikuntapathi was her\u000achoice krithi. The swarakalpana was again remarkable\u000ain the breezy spells.N.C. Anantha Krishna on\u000aviolin managed well to reflect\u000aeach of her forays into raga or\u000aswaras.P. Srinivasa Gopalan on\u000amridangam gave adept responses\u000aand his tani avartanam\u000awent well with the\u000ageneral vein of the pleasing\u000aconcert. Jayamani concluded\u000awith Ramanamame in\u000aDesh.This concert once again\u000aproved that Jayamani as an\u000aunmatched scholarly vocalist\u000aof Andhra Pradesh.
