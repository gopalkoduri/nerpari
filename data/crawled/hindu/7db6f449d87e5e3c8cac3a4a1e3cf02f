VWe are accustomed to listen to music recitals by performers, but we rarely get a chance to listen to the performance of an academic. Rasikrang Rachana provided one such rare occasion when Pandit Deepak Chatterjee sang at the India International Centre recently.The programme that focused on Pandit Chatterjee's compositions in various ragas, was organised as a tribute to the guru by his disciples, who also sang. Pandit Chatterjee retired as Senior Reader, Faculty of Music and Fine Arts, Delhi University, and has written more than 200 Khayal compositions under his pen name Rasikrang. He has also created new ragas, namely, Kanak Bhairav, Madhuranjani and Surmanjari.The programme started with the customary guru vandana in chorus with Ustad Mehmood Dhaulpuri on the harmonium and Ashish Datta on the tabla. Nabanita Chowdhury gave the first solo in raga Puriya Dhanashree. The chosen chhota khayal bandish (composition) was &#8220;Morey Mandirwa Sajanwa&#8221;. Nabanita has a clear voice and reasonably good control over voice modulation.Next came Priya Kanaungo with a short composition in raga Kedar, &#8220;Topey Waari Waari Jaaun Sughar Balamaa&#8221;. She drew attention with her alap but somehow dwindled &#8212; rather, got lost &#8212; towards the end.Kanupria sang a small composition in raga Shuddha Kalyan. The bandish was &#8220;Man Mora Laagey Na&#8221;. It was quite evident she has the potential tobecome a performer.Next came Deepak Chatterjee's first creation in raga Yaman, presented by his first disciple Deepali Chandra. The composition was &#8220;Aaj Ankhiyaan Laagil Man Mitawaa&#8221;.The only male disciple briefly presented raga Durga, a composition on the lines of a traditional bhajan.Finally, the guru himself took the stage and enthralled his audience with his knowledge of taankari through a khayal in raga Maru Behag set to Roopak tala, the words of which were &#8220;Sajan Ban Than&#8221;. This was followed by a short composition in the same raga. He ended his programme with a short rendition of raga Jog set to Jhap tala. Pandit Chatterjee was accompanied on the harmonium by Ustad Mehmood Dhaulpuri and on the tabla by Pandit Subhash Nirvaan.Though most of the compositions were in the traditional Shringar rasa, the one in Durga was different and followed the style of a Brahmanand bhajan.Unfortunately, the emotional touch of Indian classical music was completely lost during the first half of the programme.
