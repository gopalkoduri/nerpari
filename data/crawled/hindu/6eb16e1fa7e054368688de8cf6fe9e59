VSHYAMA RAJAGOPALSwati Tirunal, with 39 compositions in Hindi, has more than a dozen khayals, a similar number of bhajans, a few dadra and tappa (Punjabi lyrics) credited to him. However, Swati Tirunal, who was fluent in several languages, is not very well-know to the north of the Vindhyas.  Although a few musicians from the north have sung his compositions, not all of them know much about the royal composer.According to Ramesh Narayan, a leading Hindustani vocalist and music director, Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki, K.G. Ghinde, Pandit Ratan Mohan Sharma, Pandit Vinayak Torvi, Shounak Abhisheki and Gargi Siddharth are some of the singers who have sung the compositions of Swati Tirunal. He, however, points out that most of Swati Tirunal's Hindustani works remain untouched .Eminent Carnatic musician Mavelikkara Prabhakara Varma echoes Narayan's sentiments.AlbumA former artiste of All India Radio, Narayan was given the task of composing some of Swati Tirunal's works. Enchanted by Swati Tirunal's compositions, he released a CD during the Swati Sangeetha Mahotsavam, titled, `Swathi Manasam,' which has four numbers by Swati Tirunal. The CD has `Ghaffil bhai lo' in raag Adi Basant, `Damroo Har khar' in raag Gunkali, `Sarvo teri murali' and a tarana in raag Megh."Many of his compositions are sung as bhajans towards the end of a concert," says Narayan. `Chaliye kunjana mo' is a popular bhajan sung by many. However, many of Swati Tirunal's khayals are sung as bhajans.In an effort to popularise Swati Tirunal's compositions, Narayan has introduced a gharana. Called `Meswathi,' after the Mewati gharana of his guru, Pandit Jasjraj, students of this gharana would learn Swati's songs."I have taught most of the compositions to my students who will pass it on to their students through the five schools started under the Mewati gharana in Kerala," says Narayan.Bottom Template Starts
