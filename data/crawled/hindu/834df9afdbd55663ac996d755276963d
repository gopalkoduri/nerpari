Crystal clear clarity intoning the lyrical phraseology conspicuously coupled with an orthodox effort delving deep into the subtle expressions embedded in them marked the recital. Elaboration ofAppa Ramabhakti(Pantuvarali) andParamatmudu Velige(Vaagadheeswari) besides the evocative rendering of compositions of Ramadas and Annamayya towards the end stood out for the scholarly effort. Violinist Komanduri Krishnamacharyulu contributed by bringing out innovative sketches of raga and swara in his turn. Mangalagiri Sridhar delighted.ARSBottom Template Starts
