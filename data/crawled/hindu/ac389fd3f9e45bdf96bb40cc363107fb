VSivakumar's veena concert for Sri Rama Bhaktha Jana Samaj (K.K.Nagar) showed him as an artiste of composure. The 60-odd minutes provided to him was enough for the discerning rasika to feel the inward ripeness the artiste possessed. He seemed to be unruffled by the many disturbances that were blithely occurring on and off stage.Drops of serenity  exuded from the veena during the alapanas of Bhairavi (`Yaaro Ivar Yaaro' - Arunachala Kavirayar) with a brief tanam and Mohanam (`Evarura Ninnuvina' -Tyagaraja).Not monotonousThe kalpanaswaras had a range and style  made for the veena but were never monotonous.It was a moment of musical delight as many of the established sangatis for the pallavi (`Nee Dayaradha') and anupallavi `(Kaadhanevarevaru') were played sequentially and impeccably. Ganapathiraman (mridangam) and Guruprasad (ghatam),  gave a thani that had varying sollu orders and gathi orders. They always paused for the veena to be heard.The auditorium in reality is a huge hall with little attention paid to acoustics and how one wished for a better ambience that would permit the mind to absorb the gentle nuances of the veena. One has the right to wish, and the right to be heard!S. SIVAKUMARBottom Template Starts
