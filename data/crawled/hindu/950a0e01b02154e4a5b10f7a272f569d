VDelhi-based Andhra Cultural and Welfare Society under the aegis of a committee of hosts with the CMD of Visakha Steel Plant, P.K. Bishnoi, as its chairman, organised mega cultural evenings on Saturday and Sunday.They were held at Swarnabharati Indoor Stadium with Bishnoi as chairperson, Justice G. Yatirajulu of the AP High Court and former Cabinet Secretary T.R. Prasad as guests of honour, Padma Shri Yella Venkateswara Rao and renowned stage and cine actor Vijaya Chandar were honoured with the Pragnya Puraskar by the society.The music concert rendered later turned out to be an excellent ensemble of jugalbandis on flute by Nagaraju from Akashvani, Hyderabad.  Naadaswaram was by by N. Munikumar from Tirupati, Yella Venkateswara Rao was on the mridangam and Nemani Somayajulu (AIR, Hyderabad) on the ghatam. It happened so because,The mridangam maestro was also a source of stimulus to Somayajulu, prompting him to come up with a comparable performance on the ghatam. Exploiting the right and the left of the instrument as one unit and their specifically characteristic attributes separately in between with exquisite discernment, Yella seemed to be an embodiment of consummate knowledge of all sublime nuances the mridangam could evolve and emanate. Not only that, he seemed to be playing the lyrical and musical phraseology embedded in the composition by way of getting them transliterated into the vocabulary of the mridangam.The concert, marked by elaborate rendering ofVatapiganapathim,Sriragapancharatna keerthana,SamajavaragamanaandNagumomu,including theswaraembellishments and theThani,turned out to be awe-inspiring. TheThanihad erudite exercises inChaturasraandMisratriputaandTriuputa.
