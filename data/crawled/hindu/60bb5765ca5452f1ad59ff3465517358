VMuthukumar sang at Rajendra\u000aBhavana under the auspices\u000aof J.S.S. Sangeetha\u000aSabha in Mysore accompanied\u000aby B. Raghuram (violin) and\u000aB.C. Manjunath (mridanga).\u000aThe deeply committed artiste's\u000avoice is quite resilient, and can expand\u000aover the required sthayis\u000awith ease, though one cannot\u000avouch for a sonorous timbre. His\u000astyle has that nostalgic flavour that\u000areminds the audience of the orthodox\u000asingers of yesteryears. Further,\u000ahis involvement\u000asatisfactorily infuses the necessary\u000amood. Nevertheless, it runs\u000ashort of that musical element\u000awhich is indispensable in convincing\u000aany audience to the best possible\u000aextent: very frequent\u000avacillations in shruthi caused\u000amuch uneasiness.\u000aVarna ("Chalamela" - Durbar -\u000aVeena Kuppayyar) was his first\u000anumber sung in two speeds, with\u000aclarity and competence, appended\u000awith a few passages of swarakalpana\u000a(may be an unnecessary\u000atrend in vogue).It was from the next composition,\u000a"Vallabha Nayakasya" of\u000aMuthuswamy Dikshitar that there\u000awere signs of losing balance. Nilugades\u000ausually suffered from this\u000ainconsistence. Yet, at times, the\u000athings turned out quite different:\u000aeven in the taara sthayi, he would\u000aperfectly merge with the swaras,\u000awith sustained stability.Expatiation of Panthuvarali\u000a("Ramanatham Bhajeham") did\u000anot convincingly carry the expected\u000asentiments or moods. The alapana\u000acould have been more\u000asmooth and methodical. Neither\u000athe neraval at "Kumara Guruguha"\u000anor the swarakalpana that followed\u000awas wholly bereft of this deficiency.The singer could have advantageously\u000aavoided an alapana in the\u000avivadimela, "Santhaana Manjari"\u000a(Santhaana Manjari-Muthuswamy\u000aDikshitar). "Ratnakanchuka\u000aDhaarini" (Kamboji- Muthayya\u000aBhagavathar) comprised a neraval\u000a(at Indushekhara) and scholarly\u000aswarakalpana followed by a tani\u000aavarthana.The percussionist could have\u000aplaced more confidence in his\u000atuned instrument, and the violinist\u000asomehow was not inspired to\u000agive his best.* * *Prashanth Iyengar gave a veena\u000arecital under the joint patronage\u000aof Shruthimanjari Pratishtana and\u000aRotary Club of Mysore (West), as\u000apart of three-day music festival,\u000aShraavana Yuva Sangeethotsava.\u000aRavishankar Sharma (mridanga)\u000aand Raghunandan (ghata) provided\u000arhythm support.Prashanth's dedication has taken\u000ahim to appreciable heights,\u000acharacterised by dexterity and\u000aimagination. He could easily elicit\u000agraces like vali (curly), tribhinna,\u000akurula (lock of hairs), murchana,\u000aullasitha and many more to enhance\u000athe impact.The only shortcoming in his\u000astyle is a tendency to jerky and\u000aspeedy progressions (sometimes\u000anot aesthetically relevant to the\u000aemotive context), and this predisposition\u000acreates a snag in the\u000asmooth flow of the movements: a\u000asort of disharmony ensues between\u000ahis imagination and its realisation,\u000aleading to frequent\u000adeviations from shruthi and faltering\u000ainstances.He started his recital with Patnam\u000aSubrahmanya Iyer's Varna,\u000a"Sarasuda", in Saveri, rendered in\u000adifferent speeds. Deep and soft\u000agraces characterised this presentation.\u000aAlapana in Simhendra Madhyama\u000a("Rama Rama Gunaseema"- Swathi Thirunal) stood for his\u000amerits: pleasing and scholarly.\u000aSmoother plucking would have\u000atransformed the artistically\u000aevolved passages into melodic\u000awaves of beauty and excellence."Nanupalimpa" (Mohana) comprised\u000aan alapana and kalpanaswaras\u000adrawn on similar patterns as\u000aabove. The concert also included a\u000apallavi "Kamakshi" (Dharmavathi).
