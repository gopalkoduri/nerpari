VSangeetha Ksheerasagaram featured young promising musicians last week at Thyagaraya Ganasabha's Kala Vedika. Eighteen-year-old vocalist B. Sankaraditya and his brother Thirteen-year-old Sai Bhargava a violinist and R. Srikanth accompanied them on mridangam.Sankaraditya, who's from Warangal, is gifted with rich and melodious voice and has inherent urge to be clear in his sahitya expression.He displayed confidence in rendition of all the numbers he chose in the order of a traditional repertoire. He gave sketch of ragas to most of the compositions he rendered. Quite enthusiastic that he was, he presented swarakalpana in most of the numbers too.Sankaraditya opened with Thodi varnam Yera Napai in Aditalam of Patnam and went on to render a Nata number Parameswara of Deekshitar as first kirtana of his schedule, displaying his raga expansion capabilities. Srigananatham of Deekshitar in Eesamanohari aptly sat in its slot of repertoire as a devotional number praying to Vinayaka. He rendered Sarasangi later and set an apt mood for the rendition of a rare Neekela Dayaradu of Ramaswami Sivan in Khandachapu. Sobhillu Saptaswara in Jaganmohini of Thyagaraja was a quickie. He then took up the main raga of the concert, Sankarabharanam.The young man adopted traditional method in its expansion and gave a satisfying picture of the raga.He presented &#8216;Sarojadalanetri' in this with an elaborate swarakalpana. There were a number of light classical numbers in the end.
