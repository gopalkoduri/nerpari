VA vocal concert by Nagamani Srinath, accompanied by Sathyaprakash (violin), M.A. Krishna Murthy (mridanga) and S. Shrishylan (ghata), was organised recently by the Mahati Cultural Academy, Bangalore.The performance began with the Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Aparadhamula&#8221; set to Rasali raga and aditala, adorned with a few avarthanas of kalpana swaras. The beautiful composition &#8220;Sringagiri Nilaye&#8221; in raga Sundavinodini, which followed, was also supplemented with vibrant kalpana swaras. Raga Gaurimanohari was next taken up for a succinct alapana that was notable for its emphasis on the nishada, and the effortless sancharas in the tara sthayi. &#8220;Brova Samayamide Ramayya&#8221; in aditala was rendered with a short neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Karunakarudu Neeve&#8221;.The elaboration of Todi, the main raga of the evening, highlighted the minute and diverse shades of swaras such as the nishada, and included a plethora of sancharas in the tara sthayi and a demonstration of consonant swaras such as the rishabha and dhaivatha. The heavy gamaka-oriented presentation of the Shyama Shastri composition in misra chapu tala, &#8220;Ninne Namminanu&#8221;, accentuated by kalpana swaras at &#8220;Kamakshi Kanjadalayathakshi', reaffirmed the artiste's profound erudition and absolute command over both melodic and rhythmic aspects of the genre, though the voice was not at its fluent best. A more comprehensive treatment with a neraval was not attempted, presumably due to a power failure during the course of the item. The concluding stint of diminishing swara cycles ending at the panchama, underscored by exceptional support from the accompanists, was followed by a fairly elaborate tani avarthana.The inaugural concert of the &#8220;Sangati' series for young artistes presented by Ananya, in association with B.T.M. Cultural Academy, Sri Thyagaraja Gana Sabha Trust, and Sri Rama Lalitha Kala Mandira, was by vocalist Maruthi Prasad, accompanied by B.K. Raghu (violin), A.S.N. Swamy (mridanga), and Phaneendra Bhaskar (ghata).While a lively beginning was made with &#8220;Vandipe Ninage Gananatha&#8221; in Natta raga and adi tala, a vivid contrast was provided by the succeeding brief but bhava soaked alapana of Dwijavanthi that fused soft coaxing phrases with the occasional fast sanchara. A mellow rendition of Dikshithar's &#8216;Akhilandeswari'was followed by an elaboration of Chandrajyothi, remarkable for the dramatic introduction of the shuddha rishabha after quite a few sancharas without it, and the mellifluous passages that descended right down to the mandra sthayi shadja. &#8220;Bagayanayya&#8221;, the Thyagaraja composition in aditala, was rendered in a sedate kalapramana, emphasising the beauty of both sahithya and raga. A bracing &#8220;Thandanana&#8221; in Bhouli then led to the main raga of the concert, Bhairavi. The alapana was cast in the traditional mould, and incorporated phrases imbued with fine touches and glides, heavy gamakas and rapid brigas, and bore testimony to unfettered manodharma based on sound technique. &#8220;Indu Enage Sri Govinda&#8221; in mishra chapu tala was sung at a leisurely pace and enriched with a detailed neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Sundaravadanane&#8221;, followed by a tani avarthana. The violinist was outstanding in his solo segments as well as in his exchanges with the vocalist, and excellent support was offered by the percussionists.
