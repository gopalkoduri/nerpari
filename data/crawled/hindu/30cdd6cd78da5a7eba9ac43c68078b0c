VS. SIVAKUMARTamil Isai Sangam provides musicians great scope to delve deep into the treasure house of Tamil songs. The grammar obtainable from Tamil Pann is as strong as that of Carnatic music and one to one parallels for ragas and thalas are available with detailed notes and explanations.Nityashree Mahadevan's concert at Tamil Isai Sangam showcased her rich repertoire. ``Sadha Nandha Thandavam" (Bahudhari, Achyutha Dasar) had an alapana that saw the pouring in of all-sthayi-traversing-phrases, executed with a degree of certainty and sharp intelligence. The vocalist's forays into two viruthams, Kondal Vannanai (Hamsanandhi) and Malon Maruganai (Kapi) showed that this genre of music is of major significance, and could be equated to the niraval. In fact, virutham singing may also become a kind of defined alapana where the words have to be rendered musically and meaningfully, a happy blend of raga content and Nithyashri had all this at the back of her mind and the rendering with its wondrous turns and twists was a connoisseur's delight. Her other songs were ``Thaye Thripurasundari" (Suddhasaver, Thooran), ``Un Perumayai Evar Arivaar Eesa" (Kharaharapriya-Sivan), ``Jaga Janani" (Rathipathipriya). ``Uthaaram Thaarum Aiye" in Thodi with a relevant virutham that recounted the context of the song &#151;  Nandanar seeking permission to visit Lord Nataraja at Chidambaram.``Vandhai En Manam Pugundhai," an Azhwar Paasuram in Sumanesaranjani filled the virutham fare.Nithyashri is able to bring order and method into everything she does, a combination of intelligence and power. With all this there is this stark reality that Nithyashri has to grapple with. Her voice has an in-built shrill quality, like the "sharp" feature of the "equaliser" in audio software. This when used with unfailing regularity, has a tendency of creating discomfort to the hearer, especially when she reaches the high-notes. This takes away from the joy which she otherwise provides. This sudden upsurge that occurs can be offset by bringing in some kind of mellow resignation in the tone.Jyothsna on the violin played a soothing Bahudhari and followed the viruthams in an unhindered manner. Sivakumar on the mridangam and Deenadayalan on the morsing were adequate in support and gave a thani that had novel rhythmic combinations.Optimum useShanker Ramani's concert had this as its cornerstone &#151;  strain-free music. The single hour allotted to him was put to optimum use that met kutcheri requirements and showed vidwat. He began with ``Thathvamariya Tharama" (Sivan-Rithigowlai) that still has in its store infinite possibilities. The word should be ``Anbarkarul Gugane" and not Anbaarkarul Gugane. Tamil diction should not go awry, not at this venue anyway.The Varali alapana had highly structured and brisk phrases and the quiet kriti, ``Ka Va Va" (Sivan), was rendered with due emphasis on the alliteration and special rhyme this song is associated with.Now the list &#151;  Tharunam Idhamma (Gowlipanthu-Shyama Sastri), Kanden Kali Theerndhen (Kalyani-Goplakrishna Bharathi), Enna Solli Azhaithal (Kanada-Ambujam Krishna), Theduvadheppo Nenje (Khamas-NeelakantaSivan), Muruganin Maru Peyar (Behag-Thooran) and Vasanamigavetri (Thiruppugazh-Atana). True, quite a number for a one-hour concert. But it says more &#151;  Shanker Ramani is a plannerpar excellence. He knows how to draw from the bouquet of Tamil compositions at one's disposal.Ramani was accompanied by Sikkil T.R.Balu (violin), who played in a breezy manner to present a neat Varali and his swaras for ``Thatvamariya Tharama" had the imprint of quality. Kumbakonam Ramakrishnan's (mridangam) accompaniment was of a decent nature without any unwanted attempts at any kind of showmanship.Bottom Template Starts
