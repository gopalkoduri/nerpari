VNeela Ramgopal&#8217;s lecture-demonstration on Kerala composers  was the condensed version of a 13-part award winning series she did for AIR, Bangalore. Neela could cover only a few composers in the presentation that evening.The first composer to feature in the lecture was Parameswara Bhagavatar (1815-92). When he was 16, Bhagavatar went to Thiruvananthapuram. He had the distinction of being asthana vidwan under four successive kings. He learnt to play the violin from Vadivelu Nattuvanar.There is an interesting incident of how Bikshandar Kovil Subbaraya Pillai, who was famous for his rendering of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Giripainela,&#8217; went to Thiruvanantapuram and challenged Bhagavatar to a contest. Raghava Iyer of Haripad, who was Parameswara Bhagavatar&#8217;s disciple, said that Subbaraya Pillai should first beat him in a contest before challenging his guru. He then rendered a difficult pallavi in Thodi, and was so good that Subbaraya Pillai gave up the idea of challenging Bhagavatar.Irayaman Thampi (1782-1856), whose given name was Ravi Varma, is famous for his  lullaby &#8216;Omanathingal,&#8217; which he composed when Swati Tirunal was born. He composed in Malayalam and Manipravalam. He composed varnams, three attakathas for Kathakali, and even composed a song about Swati Tirunal&#8217;s sister Rukmini Bai.Kuttikunju Thangachi (1820-1908) was Irayaman Thampi&#8217;s only daughter. Her name was Lakshmi Pillai. She learnt Tiruvatirapaattu and music from her father. She learnt Kavyanatakam, alankara, vyakarana and tarkkam, and composed in both Malayalam and Sanskrit. She composed a thullal, and was the author of attakathas such as &#8216;Parvati Swayamvaram&#8217; and &#8216;Srimati Swayamvaram,&#8217; and literary works such as Tiruvananthapuram sthalapuranam, Nalacharitra and Gajendra moksham.Among the other composers Neela discussed were Mahakavi Kuttamuthu Kunju Kurup (1880-1943), who wrote musical plays  and was  the editor ofKerala Chandrika,K.C. Kesava Pillai (1868-1914),  who wrote his first attakatha-Prahlada charitram at the age of 15 and was conferred the title,  Sarasa Gayaka Kavimani, Govinda Maaraar (1798-1843), also referred to as  Shadkaala Maaraar, because he could handle six kalams,  Neelakanta Sivan (1839-1900),  a Tamil who lived in Kerala,  Lakshmana Pillai (1864-1950) another Tamil poet, who lived in Kerala,  M.D. Ramanathan (1923-1984), and  Thulasivanam (pseudonym for  Ramachandran Nair, retired IAS officer) who composes kritis in praise of the deities in different temples, Ayyappan, Ettumanoor Siva, Padmanabha of Trivandrum, to name a few.Dilip Simha, Dr. Sesha Prasad, Brinda Acharya and Subha Venkatesan backed up the narrative with a rendering of compositions of the various composers. The programme concluded with details about Swati Tirunal&#8217;s compositions, and a rendering of his Dhanasri thillana.
