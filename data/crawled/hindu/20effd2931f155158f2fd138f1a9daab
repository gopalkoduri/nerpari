VYoung Trichy Pradeep Kumar of Chennai proved that he is a welcome addition to  Carnatic music with an impressive  vocal concert in Palakkad.  Trained by  Trichy J. Venkatraman and gifted with a deep and resonant voice that imparts vigour to his singi\u000ang, he demonstrated the value of a good &#8216;patanthara.&#8217; Pradeep Kumar&#8217;s style was  uncompromisingly chaste and classical. He maintained perfect shruti throughout the concert and had excellent company on the stage with Avaneeswaram S.R.Vinu on the violin, Palakkad A.M. Harinarayanan on the mridangam and Vellanttanjur Sreejith on the ghatam, each of whom gave his best to enhance the appeal of the recital.&#8216;Jalajaksha,&#8217; Maanambuchavadi Venkatasubbiah&#8217;s varnam in raga Hamsadhwani, was the first number of the evening. It was followed  by &#8216;Gajananayutham Ganeswaram,&#8217; a composition of Muthuswami Dikshitar in Chakravaaham and Tyagaraja&#8217;s Pancharatna kriti &#8216;Entaro mahaanubhavulu&#8217; in raga Sri.Next Pradeep Kumar took up Varaali and gave a profound description of the raga, characterised by copious gamakas and akaaras. The kriti chosen was Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Seshachalanayakam bhajaami&#8217; and the phrases came alive in the beautiful neraval at &#8216;Aravinda bhaktanayanam.&#8217; It was further embellished by skilfully crafted kalpanaswaras.&#8216;Ambaparadhevathe,&#8217; composed by Krishnaswamy Ayya in raga Rudrapriya, is a kriti that ideally fits in between major items and used to be a favourite of old timers. Pradeep Kumar rendered it with gusto, appending it with a lively chitaswaram.He deviated from the traditional pattern, in his delineation of Sankarabharanam, the main raga of the concert.  No doubt, the alapana did contain a few evocative sangathis centred around &#8216;sadjamam&#8217; and &#8216;panchamam.&#8217; He did well in his interpretation of Syama Sastri&#8217;s famous kriti &#8216;Sarojadalanetri.&#8217; The neraval at &#8216;Saamagaanavinodini&#8217; and the innovative combinations in swaraprastharas revealed his keen sense of laya and impeccable kaalapramana.The vocalist picked up Shanmugapriya and Bagesri for ragam, thaanam,  pallavi and painted a panoramic picture of the two ragas, decorated with captivating contours of gamakas and kaarvais. The thaanam phrases were soaked in  cadences of melody. The pallavi &#8216;Vadivelane unai nambinen adimaiyai kaatharul&#8217; in Adi tala was an ingenious creation. The intelligent manipulations in swaraprastharas won acclamation from the audience.The Tamil virutham in praise of Lord Muruga in Dwijavanthi and Sindhubhairavi, followed by &#8216;Manadhirkugandhadhu murugan roopam,&#8217; a song of Tanjavur Sankara Iyer, was soul-stirring. Pradeep Kumar concluded the concert with Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s lilting tillana in Behag.Avaneeswaram Vinu&#8217;s violin accompaniment was a fine blend of sweet melody and rich tone. His raga essays were superb. Palakkad Harinarayanan has all the traits of an able mridangam artiste.  His agility and anticipation were remarkable. Vellattanjur Sreejith on the ghatam also made his presence felt. Their thaniavarthanam made an impact. The concert was organised under the aegis of the Palghat Fine Arts Society.
