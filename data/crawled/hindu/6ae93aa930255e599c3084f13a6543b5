He states, "Everybody will enjoy this album because it has a variety of songs. Every song has a different mood."Aadeel's association with India stems from his lineage. His forefathers hail from India. He says,"It is the love and appreciation of the Indian people that has made me launch an album here."On the many Pakistani singers and bands that have gained tremendous success in India, he says, "It is because of their own merit and work.

Rahman to name a few.Given a chance, he would love to work with some of the living legends, since he doesn't just admire them for their immense versatility, but for the fact that they have been able to maintain such high standards for so many years.T-Series has launched his debut album in India.
