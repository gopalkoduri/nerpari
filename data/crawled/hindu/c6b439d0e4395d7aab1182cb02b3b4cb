VSaralaya Sisters' concert was a battle to assert the musical supremacy over unhelpful voices. It was a rich menu with ragas Saveri, Latangi and Madhyamavati being elaborated. The Saveri alapana and &#8216;Sankari Samkuru' (Syama Sastri) were pleasing. The concert maintained a tempo that showed expert grooming in concert presentation norms.There was a surprise package in the form of &#8216;Sree Ramam' (Tanaroopi) of Dr. Balamuralikrishna. In the first part, &#8216;Sree Mahaganapathe' (Abhogi) was followed by swaras that exposed the voice infidelity. Thanjavur Sankara Iyer's &#8216;Muruga Thirumal Maruga' (Harikhambodi) was sung with sama eduppu instead of atitam. The Patnam Subramania Iyer masterpiece of Marivere (Latangi) was pleasant in parts and was followed by sparkling swaras. Madhyamavati was a classical effort, especially by Triveni. There were no superfluous phrases.&#8216;Rama Katha Sudha' (Tyagaraja) with an attractive kalapramanam, enthused listeners. A proper sense of proportion governed their niraval and swaras, something younger singers often seem to ignore.Violinist Kalyani Shankar's raga alapana in Saveri and Madhyamavati complemented the singers. Anoor Sharma (mridangam) and Swaminathan (ghatam) showed anticipation and embellished the attractive tempo. It is no secret that on days when the voice fails to oblige, a good programme ensures that the head is above water.
