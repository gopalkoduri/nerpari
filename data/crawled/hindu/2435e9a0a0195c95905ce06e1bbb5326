VHer melodious, well gathered cohesive alap-barhat and later the impressive sargam and aakar taans encompassing three-and-a-half octaves, were a fine synthesis of impeccable technique and her contained, sensitive expression. The chhota khayal, &#8220;Paayal baaje mori&#8230;&#8221; set to Teen tala, also vouched for her disciplined creativity with intricate, finely-accented sargams and slick taan patterns, touching even the ati-taar Shadja notwithstanding the tabla accompaniment of Rishitosh who was unable to play the seedhaa (simple) theka, desirable for a proper vocal support. Ghanshyam Sisodiya on the sarangi was much better.Concluding her recital with a hauntingly melodious Meera bhajan, Shanti wounded off up within half-an-hour. It was the most memorable concert of such short duration which left such a long lasting impact. Her mesmerising music and the kind of magnanimity she  showed that  evening would always linger in the memory of the fortunate few who  attended that  captivating concert.
