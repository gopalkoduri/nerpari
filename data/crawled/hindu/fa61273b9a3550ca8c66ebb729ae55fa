VShantala Subramanyam&#8217;s flute concert on Sunday morning was part of the ongoing series of programmes organised by the Sree Ramaseva Mandali, Bangalore, in connection with their 71st Sree Ramanavami Celebrations. She was accompanied by Ganesh Pra\u000asad (violin), P.S. Phalgun (mridanga), and Giridhar Udupa (ghata).&#8220;Viriboni&#8221;, the ata thala varna in Bhairavi, provided a vibrant start to the recital, followed by &#8220;Jayajayajaya Janakikantha&#8221; set to Natta raga and khanda chapu thala, a brief sketch of Vasantha and the Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Seethamma Mayamma&#8221; suffixed with kalpana swaras. &#8220;Evarani&#8221; in Devamrithavarshini ushered in a welcome change of mood and tempo, leading up to a measured alapana of Lathangi, incorporating several mellifluous phrases and especially notable for a prolonged stint in the mandra sthayi, descending in sequence from the panchama all the way down to the shadja, with the tranquil tenor reflected and sustained in the violin alapana as well. Patnam Subrahmania Iyer&#8217;s krithi in adi thala, &#8220;Aparadhamulan&#8221; was ornamented with several rounds of kalpana swaras that showcased the artiste&#8217;s laya expertise.The main piece of the concert was &#8220;Ramakathasudha&#8221; in Madhyamavathi set to aditala, another Thyagaraja composition, embellished with an alapana suffused with raga bhava, and succeeded by kalpana swaras ending with a focus on the panchama, and a brief but absorbing tani avarthana. The concluding items were &#8220;Marubari&#8221; (Khamas), &#8220;Akhilandeshwari&#8221; (Dwijavanthi) and &#8220;Dasarathasutha&#8221; (Jaunpuri). Though better planning would have provided more time for the main item, including a neraval, the renderings were marked by clarity of notes, aesthetic appeal, and technical prowess.Meera Vijayakumar, accompanied by K.U. Jayachandra Rao (mridanga), and S. Srishylan (ghata), presented a veena recital under the auspices of the Rajamahal Vilas Sangeetha Sabha on Sunday. The aditala varna in Vasantha, &#8220;Ninnukori&#8221;, and &#8220;Vallabhanayakasya&#8221;, the Dikshitar krithi in Begada raga and rupaka taala, augmented with kalpana swaras at &#8220;Vallivivahakaranasya&#8221; in the samashti charanam, were rendered at a lively pace attesting to commendable dexterity and confidence. &#8220;Saraseeruhasanapriye&#8221; in Natta was succeeded by a concise alapana of Sriranjini, which however, appeared to favour speed over melody. Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Sogasuga Mridangatalamu&#8221; in rupaka tala was rendered with a few brisk avarthanas of kalpana swaras.Deekshithar&#8217;s &#8220;Mamava Meenakshi&#8221; set to Varali raga and misra chapu thala was the crux of a meticulously proportioned item incorporating a raga elaboration, neraval at &#8220;Syame Sankari&#8221; and fluent kalpana swaras, and was followed by Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar&#8217;s  &#8220;Sree Jalandharam&#8221; in Gambheeranatta and adi tala.Unfortunately, less than perfect sound adjustments and acoustics up to this point robbed the rendition of clarity, especially in the lower register, but some improvement was made in time for the main item, a Raga Thana Pallavi in Bhairavi set to khanda jathi thriputa thala.A detailed alapana preceeded the thana, and the well-constructed pallavi was presented with the obligatory rhythmic variations.Ragamalika swaras in Kanada, Behag, Chandrakauns and Malayamarutham, fleeting glimpses of which were provided in the thana also, were followed by an elaborate thani avarthana.The concert concluded with Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s krithi &#8220;Enna Thavam&#8221; in Kapi and Swathi Thirunal&#8217;s tillana in Dhanasri.
