Whatever\u000amay be the\u000ashortcomings or trips, the\u000aoutcome shot an exemplary\u000amessage that it was always\u000ainvolvement and commitment\u000aenveloped in devotion\u000athat truly matters in entertaining\u000aand placing the listeners\u000aon the right path of\u000aBhakthi, as expected and envisioned\u000aby all the\u000avaggeyakaras.Observe how pleasingly\u000athe vainika presented "Paramapavanarama"\u000a(Purvikalyani\u000a- Ramnad Shrinivasa\u000aIyengar). He elaborated the\u000araga fluently, and the clarity\u000ain gamakas established the\u000anuances of the raga. It was\u000athe simplicity in sancharas,\u000awhich added a definite lustre\u000ato the raagabhaava, which\u000aderived more beauty by the\u000aoccasional employment of\u000atribhinna gamakas.Scholarly taanas preceded\u000athe lyrics, which he presented\u000ain the vocal style. The neraval\u000awas short, but in\u000aconformity with the general\u000aimport of the composition.\u000aWhen he further reinforced\u000athe presentation by elaborate\u000aswarakalpana, the audience\u000abeamed with approval\u000aand approbation.Tani avarthana by both the\u000apercussionists of high repute\u000areverberated with feathertouch\u000abeats culminating in\u000atuneful cadences, passing\u000athrough variety of challenging\u000apatterns.
