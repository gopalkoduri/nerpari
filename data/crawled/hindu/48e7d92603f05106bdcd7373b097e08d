VShankar Shanbhag and Anupama Rao kept the audience completely under their sway, when they placed before the hall the kernel of poetic excellence impregnated in the works of worthy poets of remarkable imagination and literary acumen.It was a fine blend of classical intricacies, sentimental delicacies and expressional abilities entwined to emerge as one artistic whole. Rightly, the lead artiste, Shanbhag, who also happened to be the central cohesive force of the present musical concept, aptly opts to denominate his musical concept as Kavya Sangeetha. The musical evening had been arranged by Ramsan Foundation.Shankar's voice displays recognisable signs of carefully honed timbre, and his approach vouch for richly nurtured refinement. Consistency in resonance is another feature that could incessantly keep the listeners riveted to that melodic timbre.The introductions preceding the poems, in fact, served as convincing expositions of those works, and the strong aura of intellectuality complementing such clear elocution rendered them serenely contemplative. The general diction was exemplary, and a rarity even in musicians established in the sphere of classical music.Now to substantiation. Short alapanas created the requisite moods to appreciate the intended meanings fully. Such melodic airs were ideally short, yet in strict conformity with the classical standards.Starting with selected stanzas of Kumaravyasa, the musical journey passed through DVG's &#8220;Vanasumadolenna&#8221;, Basavanna's &#8220;Kalabeda Kolabeda&#8221;, Allamaprabhu's &#8220;Hennu Maye Embaru&#8221;, wherein redolence of sage thoughts and lofty ideologies exercised their sovereignty over the minds.Similar were the experiences on hearing &#8220;Thande Thaayiya Seve&#8221; (Narahari Theertha), &#8220;Snaanava Maadiro&#8221; (Purandaradasa -stressing on ablutions that purify the inner self as opposed to erroneous notion of placing emphasis on physical beautification), &#8220;Kaniya Helaballe&#8221; (Kanakadasa - upholding non-violence) and &#8220;Taravalla Tagi&#8221; (Shishunala Sharif - sung in a tune different from the popular one with comprehendible diction, impressively portraying the connotative vision of the enlightened sage).Contextual allusions to a few nuggets of wisdom penned by Dundiraja (&#8220;Aa Panchaliya&#8221;) flashed observations enwrapped in a sense of wit. Immense involvement promptly assisted by emotive vocal inflections rendered &#8220;Nee Hinga Nodabeda&#8221;, a piece of realistic and faithful reflection of Da.Ra. Bendre's intense agony.Delving into the sentiments thus aesthetically created, the accompanists, A.S. Prasanna (keyboard), A.V. Prasad (mandolin), Ravikumar (tabla) and Mohan (rhythm pad) whole-heartedly responded to the delicacies elevating the programme to a state of ecstatic accomplishment.
