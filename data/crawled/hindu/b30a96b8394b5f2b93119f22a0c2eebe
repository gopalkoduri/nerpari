VVisakha Music Academy presented a concert by  Varanasi Sri Soumya recently. She exhibited richness of her voice and modulation in rendering compositions of Annamachraya, Saint Tyagaraja and Muthuswami Deekshitar.Another interesting aspect of the concert was that all the artistes were women and from different parts of Andhra Pradesh. While Sri Soumya hailed from Hyderabad, Durga Bhavani on the violin was from Vijayawada and Nagalakshmi on mridangam came from Vizianagaram.Sri Soumya is a central government scholarship holder for Carnatic music (Vocal). She began her concert withVanajakshiVarnam in Kalyani and rendered a rare composition of Saint Tyagaraja&#8217;sVarasibhivahanain ragam Supradeepam. Delineating the ragam Charukesi she rendered Swathi Tirunal&#8217;s compositionKrupayapalayawith ease and elegance.She took ragam Thodi, &#8216;the king of ragas&#8217; for major exposition and she was in full command as she sang the classic compositionKaddanuvarikiof Saint Tyagaraja. Durga Bhavani&#8217;s scintillating performance on the violin and Nagalakshmi&#8217;s delectable support on the mridangam made it memorable.It was heartening to see the impact of M.S.
