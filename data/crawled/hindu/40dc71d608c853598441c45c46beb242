VHow many of us know that Bangalore&#8217;s Tulasi Thotta Devasthana premises was a peaceful retreat for the 18th Century lady-Haridasa, Yedugiriyamma, for several years of her music practice? The Karnataka musician and musicologist ((1828-1908) hailed from a large family in Bangalore whose ingenious thought flow in Kannada was penned by her grandchildren, said vocalist Sukanya Prabhakar in her third series of lec-dem on &#8220;Mahila Haridasaru&#8221; for Ananya Cultural Academy in Malleswaram recently. &#8220;Toppal Venkatacharya&#8217;s book is a veritable guide to knowing the pulse of Yedugiriyamma&#8217;s compellingsharanagatibeliefs, heavily dictated by Ramanujacharya&#8217;s Vishistadwaita philosophy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Her lyrics were descriptive and most of the passages reinforced her bhakti and surrender at His altar.&#8221;Sukanya Prabhakar&#8217;s series on Mahila Haridasaru is really amazing for the way it throws up such unknown facts about Carnatic music and the world it has constructed for us. (The last two in the Mahila Haridasaru series were on Galagali Avva and Helavana Katte Giriyamma). CDs and books can at best help to get an idea, but demonstration and talks on the treasure that saints such as Yedugiriyamma have left behind need diligent homework to bring it across to public. It is here that Sukanya&#8217;s mind-boggling study of over eight months and the selection of ragas and talas for  casting Yedugiriyamma&#8217;s kritis came to the fore.  What made it a complete staging was the enjoyable accompaniment on the violin by Dr. Jyothsana Srikanth with a lovely pace set by B.K. Chandramouli on the mridanga.Toppal Venkatacharya&#8217;s comment of &#8216;a shuddha, poorna sahitya&#8217; for Yedugiriyamma&#8217;s work holds value. &#8220;Through her lyrics, what emerges is an overall picture that  is a mature commentary on the ephemeral human existence,&#8221; said Sukanya. &#8220;The body is but a transient clothing for the soul that aspires to reach His pada after the journey,&#8221;  says Yedugiriyamma in her kriti, &#8220;Ghora paathakagalannu bittu ninnannu seruvadu yaavaga.&#8221;Yedugiriyamma&#8217;s striking Vishistadwaita leanings were expressed in her kritis on Ekadasi Utsava, Pushpothsava, Andal Neerattal and Tiruppavai, Vishnusahasranama, Alwars, Dashaavatara Stotra, Dhanurmasa Seva, Krishna Leela, Asura Samhaara etc.,  She was adept in Kannada, Tamil and Telugu, observed Sukanya.  Some of her kritis throw light on the cultural practices and there are also those that speak of the  elaborate ornaments used during her time.Kritis and Dheerga Charana kritis of Yedugiriyamma that were discovered amounted to 74 amongst which her 100-verse Ramayana and a rare mangala on Saraswati gain importance.How did the raga-choosing exercise take place for Yedugiriyamma&#8217;s kritis? &#8220;The Sharanagati theory in her thinking can only have gliding, bhakthi-laden scales as Shankarabharana, Sindhubhairavi and Abhogi,&#8221;  says Sukanya, who later made the session exciting by leading the Abhogi kriti &#8220;Sree Vedanayaki&#8221; and got the audience to join her. The rare Mangala on goddess Saraswati was but a fitting finale to the interesting evening on Saint Yedugiriyamma whose signature emblem or the ankita Muddu Venkata and Venkata Krishna described her affinity for Sri Hari.The next in the series will be Harappanahalli Bhemavva at Ananya in March 2009. A programme on Mahila Haridasaru by Sukanya Prabhakar is also being brought out by AIR&#8217;s FM Channel in Amruthavarshini, every Saturday, between 7.30 and 8 a.m.
