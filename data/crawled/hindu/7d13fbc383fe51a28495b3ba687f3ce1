VVijayalakshmi Subramaniam's performance for the Sri Thyagaraja Seva Samiti's Bahulapanchami ably brought out the unified excellence of sahitya and sangita by the way she rendered the saint's compositions with clarity.Her particular style and\u000acontent in the raga alapana strictly\u000aadhered to text-book guidelines not\u000ainspired by aesthetic flashes.\u000aThe raga portraits were quintessentially\u000asedate, methodical step-bystep\u000adevelopment. The violinist Akkarai\u000aSubhalakshmi's solo versions\u000awere focused on gripping sancharas\u000awell anchored in qualitative\u000apicturisation.Vijayalakshmi revealed a sense of\u000aease in her expository technique both\u000ain the madhyama and tara sthayi negotiations.\u000aSubtle music reflects the\u000ainter relationship between aesthetics\u000aand vision which is abundant in Sri\u000aTyagaraja's kritis and mere rendering\u000agenerates dignified appeal. Vijayalakshmi\u000aput her faith on this aspect for\u000athere were only two alapanas - Vachaspati\u000aand Saveri. In handling these\u000aragas there was consistency and evenness\u000aof tonal modulation.Authentic qualityIn the violinist's approach there\u000awas a distinctly authentic quality. The\u000araga sancharas of Vachaspathi (`Kanta\u000aJoodumi') and Saveri were meticulously\u000achiselled. There were many\u000aclever turns of phrases dressing up the\u000adifferent facets particularly in the presentation\u000aof Saveri. Vijayalakshmi's\u000aobjective was continuous progress in\u000athe alapana process underlined by\u000astrict conservatism. Between the vocalist\u000aand the violinist the musical cul-\u000ature built over the decades was well\u000apreserved.The concert lacked liveliness because\u000aof the selection of songs - `Ra Ra\u000aMa Inti Daka' (Asaveri), `Kanugonu\u000aSowkhyamu' (Nayaki), `Evvare Ramaiah'\u000a(Kangeyabhooshani) and `Rama\u000aBana' (Saveri) These ragas and\u000asongs were mainly soft-textured demanding\u000aextraordinary vocal depth to\u000amake them vibrant. The satisfaction\u000ato the rasikas arose from the lucidity\u000awith which the kritis were sung.\u000a`Evarani' (Devamritavarshini) and\u000a`Anupama Gunaambudhi' (Atana)\u000awere two brisk items.Madirimangalam Swaminathan\u000akept the percussive sector in good\u000ashape. His beats were firm and strong\u000avividly supportive in the song session.\u000aThe thani was impressively inlaid with\u000afascinating korvais and mixed jatis.
