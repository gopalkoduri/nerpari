VTrue to its reputation, the annualVishnu Digambar Jayanti featured lesserknown and established musicians with anunerring eye for quality.The guru's guruVishnu Digambar Paluskar, born on August 18, 1872, placed Hindustani music on\u000acourse for public appreciation and brought it within reach of the non-elite.\u000aPaluskar was born in Kurundwad, in the Bombay Presidency, present-day\u000aMaharashtra. He lost his eyesight due to an accident but his musical talent was\u000anurtured thanks to the local king, who ensured he was trained by the stalwart\u000aBalkrishnbua Ichalkaranjikar. Later he learnt Dhrupad under Pandit Chandan\u000aChaube. He is the first reported musician to have given a public concert, charging\u000aa nominal fee. This was a significant change from the usual practice of giving\u000aperformances either in palaces or temples. He pioneered institutionalised music\u000ateaching by establishing the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya in Lahore in 1901 and later\u000aa branch in Bombay. He also pioneered a system of notation for Hindustani music.\u000aHis holistic approach ensured his students were aware of the Carnatic system of\u000aIndian classical music, on which he published a book back in 1901.\u000aHis students including Omkarnath Thakur, Vinayak Rao Patwardhan, Narayan Rao\u000aVyas and his own son D.V. Paluskar became celebrated teachers and vocalists.\u000aSome of India's favourite songs associated with the nationalist movement are set\u000ato music by this doyen. These songs include his own composition of Vande\u000aMataram in raga Kafi, the bhajan "Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram" and his own\u000aversion of "Saare Jahan Se Achcha".\u000aHe died on August 21, 1931.The venerated Vishnu Digambar Jayanti Sangeet Samaroh-2008, presented in four sessions of Hindustani and Carnatic classical music for three consecutive  days at Kamani auditorium this past week, marked the 136th birth anniversary of the great savant of music and philanthropist who devoted his entire life with missionary zeal in service of music.
