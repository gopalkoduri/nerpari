VIn keeping with the spirit were Kudanthai Sisters Bama Kannan and Manjula, vocalists simple and down-to-earth.Their opening Thodi varnam, &#8216;Era napai&#8217; adhered to copybook style.  The sisters sang with extra emphasis on the swaram and sahityam. But there was no element of wisdom or vocal prowess involved in the exercise.  The  vivacity of the ragas, however, saved the effort from becoming too mundane.  &#8216;Gajavadana&#8217; (Sriranjani) did sparkle,  with Bama and Manjula enthusiastically exchanging kalpanaswara. The korvai chosen by Manjula   showed her ingenuity but when Bama joined with vigour in the ultimate closing part, the exercise turned more into a rehearsed act than a spontaneous one. The extended Ramayana composition of &#8216;Bhavayami Raghuramam&#8217; of Swati Thirunal could have been presented at a faster tempo.The Shanmukhapriya alapana by Manjula covered the conventional phrases of the raga yet could not rise beyond mediocrity. With a few extensions of the karvais, briskness in the brigas chosen and a quick rounding off might have given a better picture of Shanmukhapriya.  The Khambodi alapana by Bama Kannan was sincere but not an in-depth exploration.  The popular Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Maa Janaki&#8217; and the niraval swaras at &#8216;Vani matalagu&#8217; came as a tepid fare.Good training, sincerity in approach, open throated articulation and clarity in enunciation are undoubtedly the strengths of Kudanthai Sisters. But, these alone cannot  boost the overall impact without grace in delivery, with hairline departures from sruti in the upper regions, employing same tempo for all kritis. The duo should give serious thought to intensive sadhana  backed by forceful presentation.Thiruvellore Parthasarathy caught the attention in raga expositions through his matured comprehension and neat delivery. R. Yogaraj on the mridangam and Venkatesh on the ghatam livened up the proceedings  with their powerful rhythmic support.
