VVisakha Music Academy, Vishakapatnam, featured a vocal recital of Koviladi R. Madhwa Prasad from Trichy on the first Thursday of this month at Kalabharathi. Disciple of his father, leading musician Rangarajan Prasad, an A-grade vocal and mridangam artiste of AIR, despite being an employee of SBI, he has widely travelled to perform in India, USA, Canada and Malaysia.In the company of equally efficient violinist M. Satyanarayana Sarma from Amadalavalasa and local mridangam player Dhanwada Dharma Rao, he rendered an entreating vocal recital.Starting on a swift note with Abhogi varnam, he pleasantly sustained the tenor and tempo by way of rendering Mahaganapathim (Nata), Marugelara (Jayanthasree), Sobhill Sapthaswara (Jaganmohini), Narayana of Purandharadasa (Suddhadhanyasi), and Sakalasanthikaramu of Annamayya (Bahudaari), adorned with exquisitely elaborate alapana of the raga, and similarly Bagayenayya (Chandrajyothi) in the first half.Shrewdly expansive rendering of the Darbar krithi Ramabhirama with eruditely adorned ragaalapana, neravu and swaram, Vasanthabhairavi kirthana Nee Daya Rada concluded with swaram in the two tempos. Marivere (Lathaangi) with exemplary exhibition of alapana and Koluvamaregada (Thodi), with sublimely set neravu and swaram, left an impression of being an ever haunting melody.
