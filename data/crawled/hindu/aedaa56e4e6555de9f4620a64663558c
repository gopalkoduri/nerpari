VAbhishek Raghuram sang under the auspices of J.S.S. Sangeetha Sabha as part of the five- day Annual Music Conference.The young singer of remarkable competence and expertise, endowed with a rare faculty of having imbibed the expected quintessence of the ragas in general and of the swaras in particular, was able lay before the audience every nuance of the compositions he chose for interpretations, especially in alapana and the lyrical sections ( in striking contrast with the swarakalpana sections).As if reaching an unparalleled point of consummation, developments in &#8220;Dudukugala&#8221; (Gowla- Pancharatna Kriti- Thyagaraja) vouched for divine sentiments, inspiring import and absorbing musical elements. Ideal speed and majestic intonations worked admirably in fortifying the experience. Profound maturity in vocal capabilities and artistic imaginations enabled him to present the lyrics with perfectly intoned gamakas accurate even at the microtonal levels.The singer with great fluency expatiated Kaapinaarayani (&#8220;Sarasa Saama&#8221; -Thyagaraja) and Abheri (&#8220;Bhajare Maanasa&#8221;-Vasudevacharya): it was the analytical approach creaming off all the essences of the ragas on hand that made such a deep impression throughout, richly packed with melodic movements. Nevertheless, the swaraprastara sections laid more emphases on the rhythm aspects, and therefore, went in variance with the general imports of the lyrics. Labyrinthine phrases only proved his technical mettle: did not complement either the mood or melody.Redundant bravura either countermanded (observe swarakalpana for &#8220;Isha Pahimam&#8221; - Kalyani-Thyagaraja- the passages sounded as if they carried haasya rasa rather than that of bhakthi) or attenuated (as it happened in Vasudevacharya's &#8220;Bhajare Maanasa&#8221;) the pleasant experience one enjoyed in either the alapana and lyrical sections.The concert included Navaragamaalika (&#8220;Valachi&#8221;-Patnam), &#8220;Yaare Rangana&#8221; (Hindola-Purandaradasa) and &#8220;Krishna Ni Begane&#8221; (Yaman-Vyasarayaru). Mysore Shrikanth (violin), K.V. Jayachandra Rao (mridanga) and Giridhar Udupa (ghata) accompanied the singer.Paying respectful tributes to Muthuswamy Dikshithar, Uma Kumar sang at Ganabharathi, Mysore. A brisk beginning with Pallavi Gopala Iyer's Attathala Varna, &#8220;Vanajakshi Ninne&#8221; in Kalyani provided the necessary impetus to the concert, which the young singer treated with lively progressions and fluency.Her voice was pleasing and capable of spanning over the three sthayis, though prolonged articulations in the tharasthayi did not favour maintenance of fine timbre and melody, to the expected degree.Whereas, adherence to shruthi in the nilugades were perfect and stable, occasional but perceptible deflections undermined the sanchara phases in alapana and swarakalpana sections. Such observations continued to hit the presentation to some degree in &#8220;Gana Nayakam&#8221; (Rudrapriya- preceded by alapana and followed by swarakalpana sections), &#8220;Neerajakshi Kamakshi&#8221; (Hindola - the alapana thrived by virtue of the beauty of the raga) and &#8220;Madhava Mamava&#8221; (Nilambari).Alapana in Dharmavati (&#8220;Parandhamavati&#8221; - focus of the concert) convinced the audience more than it did in Thodi (Kamalambike). Whereas, Dharmavathi stood for fluency, scholarship and sentiments (observe neraval at the charana, &#8220;Paranjothi Vikaasini&#8221;), Thodi lagged behind in these respects, and appeared more mechanically treated.One wished the entire concert conformed to all merits, the alapana, lyrical progressions and the swaraprastara sections Parandhamavati displayed.
