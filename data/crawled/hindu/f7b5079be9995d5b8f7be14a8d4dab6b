VHistory of The Golden Temple, AmritsarDVD; Geethanjali; Super Audio; Rs. 200One of the most easily identifiable monuments of India is Amritsar's Golden Temple. The gold-plated structure continues to attract visitors from India and abroad throughout the year.This documentary, directed by Karamjit Singh Duggal, traces the establishment of the Gurudwara, and its place in the Indian religious ethos.Harmandir Sahib (which translates as &#8216;Temple of God') houses the Sri Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikhs. The place of worship was built with four doors to show that people of every religion and faith are welcome here. The temple sits pretty in the middle of a large man-made lake which lends its name to the city&#8212;Amritsar. The lake was dug by the fourth Sikh guru, Guru Ram Das in 1577. The temple complex has several shrines dedicated to past Sikh Gurus and saints.Originally built during AD 1574, the site of the temple was surrounded by a small lake in a thin forest. The story goes that Emperor Akbar, who visited the third Sikh Guru, Guru Amar Das, was so impressed by the way of life in the town that he gifted a jagir to the Guru's daughter when she married Bhai Jetha, who later became the fourth Sikh Guru, Ram Das. He then enlarged the lake and built a small township around it.It was under the leadership of the fifth guru Guru Arjan Dev Ji that the present structure came up. In 1588, the Sufi saint Hazrat Mian Mir, a close friend of Guru Arjan Dev Ji, laid the corner stone.The DVD throws light on the history of five Holy Ponds of Amritsar, the festivals celebrated here and information on other historical Gurudwaras of Amritsar. This visual lesson in monuments would have been more interesting with better compering. The commentary is available both in English and Punjabi.(For details, call 42140067, log on to www.musicandchants.com or email: supertape@yahoo.com)Savitha gautam
