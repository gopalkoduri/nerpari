VMusic not of a kind to soothe the senses, but to present an image of an instrumentalist, showy in inciting excitement, was the nature of Mandolin Srinivas&#8217;s recital for the Krishna Gana Sabha in the Gokulashtami series. The mammoth high-decibel\u000a speed-craft in traversing the octaves of swaraprastaras was not meant to caress but to dazzle. An artiste of his eminence is capable of giving the soft touch to his exposition but Srinivas was not willing to exercise this genre of performance. With many gifts, he had many options to proclaim his varied felicities and his performing objective on that day seemed to be to sound spectacular.Percussive-oriented playing technique hovered over the whole kutcheri. It was a cosy bond   between Mandolin Srinivas and the mridangist B. Harikumar, who with his over-energetic non-stop beats, fed the flamboyant impulses in the swaraprastara part of the concert. In this phase, violinist Chandramouli was a passive onlooker. Srinivas revealed his mastery over the instrument and his power to carry out whatever the manodharma desired. His skill and perfection, ready and impeccable expression not only provoke admiration but also envy.To a rasika with long years of anubhava, the picture of the slow phrasings in the early stages of his alapanas of Gowrimanohari and Mohanam was marked by maturity and musical eloquence. When the latter development turned into self-conscious rhetoric, the earlier impressions of melodic richness got erased.  Worthy of his stature as a great musician, it would do him immense good to get himself lost  in the tenderness of melody rather than emphasise  stridency.Srinivas directly transferred his interpretative supremacy in the presentation of the kirtanas, &#8216;Brochevaa Revarura&#8217; in Khamas, &#8216;Garuda Gamana Vasudeva&#8217; in Gowrimanohari, a song that is wrongly attributed to  Tyagaraja, &#8216;Teratee Yaga Raadha&#8217; (Gowlipantu) and &#8216;Mohana Rama&#8217; (Mohanam).The very extravagance of his play made one feel his music to be exceptional. His fingering mobility on beat lines spoke of his willing surrender to fascination. The management of the recital was a stylistic achievement at the hands of Mandolin Srinivas.Chandramouli, in his solo versions of the ragas and swaraprastaras,   was wise enough to tread  the traditional path with a few sancharas to fix the essential characteristics of Gowrimanohari and Mohanam. What Srinivas brought out by immensity Chandramouli achieved by aesthetic simplicity.The thani between Hari Kumar and S.V. Ramani (ghatam) was just a laya tsunami.
