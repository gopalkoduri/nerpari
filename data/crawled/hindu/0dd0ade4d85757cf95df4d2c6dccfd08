VAficionados of flute music are well aware of Romu Mazumdar&#8217;s impeccable virtuosity over the instrument. Recently, the maestro enchanted the audience at Shivam with his renditions of Bhakti songs, including two favourite bhajans of Bapu.Accompanied on the tabla by Ram Gopal Mishra and on another flute by Pramod, the accomplished disciple of Maihar Gharana, sang and playedThumki Chalat Ramchandra, a bhajan in Thumri format, composed by Tulsidas. According to the style of his Gharana, developed by Baba Allauddin Khan Sahib, he covered all tempos from Ati Vilambit, Madh Vilambit, Madhya Drut and Ati Drut in his flute playing.As is the custom in Thumri and bhajans, the tabla played in teen-tal while the other flute harmonies.Romu treated the audience to his distinctive style of playing which consists of sustaining high-pitched notes for a long time-interval, use of Andolan as well as playing fast, lilting melodies, along with Gamakas, although on this particular occasion, he preferred to concentrate on fewer notes and draw out their essence.Romu who has performed with musicians as varied as George Harrison and Ry Cooder was in his elements during his presentation ofRaghupati Raghav&#8230;, aka the Ram Dhun, another bhajan based on a composition of Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, originally by saint-poet Ramdas. Especially impressive were his improvisations, during the Sawal-Jawab section. Ram Gopal Mishra excelled in matching up to Romu&#8217;sji&#8217;s solo standards.The audience sang enthusiastically towards the end, when Romu asked it to do so.The evening was brought to an end with a rendition ofVaishnav Jan, another Bapu favourite, composed by Narsimh Mehta, a 15th century Gujarati poet, a bhajan that expresses the basic seed of Hindu philosophy, namely compassion (damayatta), the highest quality that makes a person human, greater than charity (datta) and self-control (dayadhavam). Especially evocative was his use of the lower notes of the scale, which was facilitated by the flute (Shank Bansuri) that he has designed himself, with extra bass notes.
