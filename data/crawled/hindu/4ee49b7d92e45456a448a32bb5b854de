VVocalist B. Arundhati Sarkar is known for her sustained religiousness in her style of rendering a recital of carnatic music. She is rated one among the very few who are capable of expounding enchanting expression out of classicism and sublime splendour out of orthodoxy, in the style of exposition.Her recital last week for Visakha Music and Dance Academy in Kalabharathi offered glimpses of such scholarly effort. Thanks to the equally erudite support rendered by M. Srinivasa Narasimha Murthy on violin, V.V. Ramana Murthy (mridangam) and M. Sridhar (ghatam), it was a delightful concert. Starting on a tuneful note with theMohana Varnamof Ambideekshitar, she went on to renderingPranamamyahamof Mysore Vasudeachar (Goula),Ninnu vinaof Syama Sastry (Reethigoula - Trisranada- Aditaalam),Vinave O Manasaof Thyagaraja (Vardhani),Jananipaahiof Swathi Tirunal (Suddhasaveri),Singaravelavanof Papanasam Sivam (Ananda Bhairavi),Anandamitavarshiniof Dixitar (Amrithavarshini),Pidikititalambralaof Annamayya inDeshand expansive expatiation ofKoniyaadaof Ponnaiah Pillai (Kambhoji).She adorned most of the earlier items as well withalapanaandswaramwhich including those more elaborately inKambhojiproved to be devout fructification of the emotionally embedded piety in the lyrics.Ramana Murthy and Sridhar executed a scintillatingtani, which seemed to be an aesthetic effort elaborating the exquisitely embedded in theKambhojicomposition andswaraprastaramrendered by the vocalist. Murthy's exposes ofragaandswaramin his turns were masterly. He contributed to the gusto all through that was sustained by the vocalist with absorbing poise.Venkatesanaadhamof Gourisankara Sthapathi inBrindavanasarangaandKrishan Ne Begaane Baaro baroof Vysaraya constituted the lilting tailpiece.A.R.SBottom Template Starts
