VA music and dance programme was jointly conducted by Vijayawada Cultural Academy and G.V.R.Government College Music and Dance at Gokaraju Laila Gangaraju Kala Vedika. The staff members of the college presented pleasing music for the dancers who performed several Annamacharya keertanas attractively. Though the programme was conducted to pay tribute to the late legendary singer M.S. Subbalakshmi, strangely none of the speakers who were on the stage prior to the programme spoke about the great singer.However, the music and dance presentations were impressive with the musicians rendering Annamacharya keertanas in a polished manner and dancers interpreting the content of the keertanas convincingly. The programme started with Subbalakshmi&#8217;s famous tune in BowliSrinannarayana. This was the only item which brought back the great singer&#8217;s memory. Other keertanas wereAlarulu Kuriyaga, Emani Pogadudune, Adivo Alladivo, Vedukondama, Podagantimayya, Narayanate Namo Namo, Bhavamulona, Jagadapu ChanavulaandPaluku Tenela Talli. The dancers were Srisakhi, Siva Kalyani, Uma Durga, Durga Devi, Hemalata, Swarnalata, Sowmya, Ramakrishna, Mahathi, Hari, Mani, Lavanya, Lasya, Meghana, Vijayananda and Sivakumar. Fine musical support was provided by the staff members of the college M. Krishna Mohan (vocal), K. Lakshminarasamma (vocal), K.R. Sudharani (vocal), P. Nageswara Rao (violin), S.R. Govindarajan (veena), M. Vijayakumar (mridangam), Amrit Kumar (tabla) and Steven Raju (ghatam).The prize winners of the Annamacharya keertana competitions conducted earlier were R. Srinivas, P.Ch. Pallavi, P. Savitri in the senior category and D. Mriduravali, M.J.S. Vaishnavi and V. Satwik in the junior category.
