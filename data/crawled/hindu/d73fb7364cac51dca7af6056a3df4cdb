VR. Prasanna's guitar recital on the final day of the twelfth Pongal festival of music at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan was an evening session of explosives. He was accompanied by J.Vaidyanathan on the mridangam and Purushothaman on the kanjira.His execution of `Vanajakshi' varnam at the commencement was a prelude to the listeners of the impending fireworks in the subsequent numbers. His presentation of `Guru Guhaya' in Saama and `Parvati Ninnu' (Kalkada) was pleasing with his fingers dancing on the frets.Chaste delineationThe elaboration of Bilahari before commencing `Kanukontini' followed by swaras was well-conceived. A chaste delineation of Thodi with grihabhedam of ragas in Kalyani, Harikhambodi and Natabhairavi with niraval and swaras was ear-shattering.The highlight of the programma was the RTP with the pallavi line, `Anandham, Sachidanandhan, Paripoornam Brahmosmi,' in the four ragas, Revathi, Hamsadhwani, Hindolam and Mohanam. But the battery of sound made the listeners feel the absence of melodic moorings and lyrical softness.The younger percussionists also joined the fray as sparks flew in their thani session full of thunderous beats and korvais. Earlier, Majith Selavan and Manish of the Thiruppugazh Anbargal group gave a tranquil and soulful session of devotional music singing select hymns from Thiruppugazh.T.K.GANAPATHYBottom Template Starts
