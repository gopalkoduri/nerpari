VIt is the entertainment sector that is experiencing a boom, but our business is always steady. Generally speaking, visuals attract. Hence there are takers more for the video stuff. But the audio album ha sits own patrons.  We are the first to have introduced digital music. We have more than 300,000 tracks with us. For this music season we are coming out with a six-CD-pack of the best of Sangita Kalanidhi special.

Thoroughbred professionals, an international-standard studio, state-of-the-art infrastructure, and a collective passion for music form the backbone of the company. Non-Film music is growing at 15-20 per cent, but the overall industry growth is sluggish at 3-4 per cent. Loss due to Piracy and unauthorised downloads.Domestic repertoire consistently accounts for more than 90 percent of the total music market in India.Our recent releases are &#8216;Voyage 3&#8217; Fusion by Rajhesh Vaidhya, &#8216;Mookapanchasathi &#8211; Sanskrit Devotional&#8217; by the Bombay Sisters, &#8216;Krishna Sandhya&#8217; bhajans by Anup Jalota, &#8216;Live at Darbar Hall&#8217; by Bhimensen Joshi, &#8216;Enchanting Mantras&#8217; by Sadhana Sargam and Hanuman Chalisa by O.S.Arun.

We have been using our technological prowess to create a slew of instructional and entertainment products on esoteric subjects such as Carnatic music, Bharatanatyam, Vedas and Yoga marketed under the brand name Swathi&#8217;s Sanskriti Series. We have been in the field for the past seven years think the music industry is growing day by day.This time round, Swathi unveils &#8216;Vara Veena,&#8217; a comprehensive disc of veena lessons presented by none other than the late veena maestro R.K Suryanarayana.

Our releases include Sanskrit and Tamil devotionals, plays, serials and animation. Our motto is to give the buyer more at less cost and so we have priced each VCD Rs 49 and each DVD Rs. 69.We take stock of the situation before the season starts every year.  The past year has revealed  a distinct inclination towards  Audio CDs. This is a healthy development that lends itself to the manufacture of economical volumes of a particular programme. Also we are encouraged to field new talent. And audio cassettes are on their way out.On the visual side,  people prefer live classical performances. Some programmes of this kind have appeared and met with limited success.  The main constraint today in the growth of this market is the number of DVD/VCD players. With the availability of playing devices, the situation is bound to improve.Our productions include &#8216;Sundarakandam&#8217; by Velukkudi Krishanan, &#8216;Sudha Madhuri&#8217; by Sudha Ragunathan, &#8216;Shaaswathi&#8217; by Nithysashree Mahadevan and Saulabyam by O.S.Arun.

Music these days is not limited to CD and cassettes. Digital downloads, ring tones and caller tunes are a huge area of interest for teenagers and young adults. Even those up to the age of 40 and are net savvy have the inclination towards these new formats. The music industry has definitely been hit hard by piracy and the digital music revolution with  film and pop music taking the brunt.  In keeping with the demand for visuals, we strive to create beautiful treats in the form of animation films for children, yoga demonstrations and captivating dance performances.
