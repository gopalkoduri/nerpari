VChaganti Mahalakshmi&#8217;s vocal recital for Sarvani Sangeetha Sabha showcased the artiste&#8217;s maturity of phrasing and high level of commitment. This senior disciple of Neti Srirama Sharma is also an accomplished veena artiste. Her powerfully \u000apitched alapanas in Kalyani and Kharaharapriya conveyed in a strong voice and the clarity of her ideas stated that her music is made of stern stuff with no room for frippery.Steady karvais at the gandhara and vibrant madhyama kala passages issuing from the nishada displayed the raga Kalyani to advantage in the Madhya sthayi. The artiste chose not to dwell on the tara sthayi shadja suite, moving upwards to the gandhara instead where her voice found a comfortable perch, dispatching a rain of medium-to-fast passages. To counter the flow of the rather repetitive tempo, the use of jarus, aptly interpolated, would have served as an effective device.The young violinist, K. Gokul&#8217;s raga essay bore the stamp of assiduous training and application. The vocalist&#8217;s rendition of the Syama Sastri kriti &#8216;Talli Ninnu Nera&#8217; with niraval and kalpanaswara suffixes was decisive and to the point. Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Tyagaraja Yoga Vaibhavam&#8217; (Anandabhairavi) in which the sahitya is a favoured example of gopucha yati and srotovaha yati was more spartan than soothing.With easy reach in the upper and lower registers intact as the concert progressed, the vocalist embarked on a leisurely exploration of the main raga, Kharaharapriya. The violinist responded with an alapana that was not only detailed but also disciplined. The tukkada section included compositions such as Narayana Tirtha&#8217;s &#8216;Pahi Pahi&#8217; (Kedaram) in which clear, emphatic enunciation lent sturdiness.Kolkata Karthick on the mridangam tended to be unobtrusive and his thani laid focus on rounds of melkala sollus.Bottom Template Starts
