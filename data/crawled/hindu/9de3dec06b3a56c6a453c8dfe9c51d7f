The concert took place at Swarajhari's usual venue Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram.Santala who began her musical pursuit at the tender age of four, took intense training from veterans like Vairamangalam Lakshminarayanan and O.S. Thyagarajan and in laya intricacies she received guidance from Trichur Narendran, Patri Satishkumar and P.S. Phalgun. She started the concert with the famous Bhairavi varnam Viriboni and followed with Jaya jaya janaki kanta in Nata finishing it with crisp kalpana swaras. Evarani Nirnayinchedira in Devamritavarshini was beautifully played in proper tempo and with apt bhava. Latangi was elaborated by Santala with total command over the raga bhava preceding the keertana Aparadhamulanniyu Manninchi. . Tuneful and soulful melody prevailed all through the concert. V.
