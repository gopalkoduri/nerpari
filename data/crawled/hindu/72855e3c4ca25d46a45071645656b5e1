VRAMA DEVIThe Carnatic music scene is colourful and vibrant today with more and more youngsters entering the field and fascinating the audience with their mellifluous  voice and novel approaches. They  impress the young and the old alike. However, for the older people, there is a special liking for the stars of their youth and they certainly value the simple and pure renderings of the artistes of yesteryear.The  audience at the Abhinava Theertha Pravachana Mandapam, Coimbatore, which predominantly consisted of those fifty and above, thoroughly enjoyed the concert of  Bombay sisters, C. Saroja and C. Lalitha, organised by Sri Krishna Sweets, Coimbatore, as part of its monthly concert series `Eppadi Padinaro.' Their alapanas of Kalyani and Khambodi were unhurried and smooth. The all-time favourites `Himadrisuthe Pahimam' (Syama Sastry) and `O Rangasayee' (Tyagaraja) were presented in the traditional form. During the neraval and swaraprastharas, the sisters had to strain their vocal chords to keep pace with their imagination. The concert commenced with the sprightly kriti in Nattai, `Jaya Jaya Swamin Jaya Jaya.' After a brief but pleasant alapana of Khamas, the sisters sang `Brochevarevarura' by Mysore Vasudevachar. `Bhogeendra Shaayinam' (Kuntalavarali) and `Manavyalakichara (Nalinakanthi) by Swathi Tirunal followed.Listeners' choice`Innu Daya Baaradhe' by Purandaradasa, `Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama Sri Rama' by Bhadrachala Ramadas, and `Suzhalum Chakkaram Oru Kaiyil' with the refrain `Govinda Hari Govinda' were steeped in devotion. `Alai Payuthe Kanna' and `Eppadi Padinaro' were sung to honour the listeners' requests. The concert came to an end with a lively tillana. Violin by Usha Rajagopalan was full of depth, imagination and melody. K. R. Ganesh on the mridangam and Madippakkam A. Murali on the ghatam were impressive.It is heartening to note that the tendency to leave the hall during the `tani' is slowly coming down and people sit through enjoying the patterns woven in laya and leave only after the song is over.Bottom Template Starts
