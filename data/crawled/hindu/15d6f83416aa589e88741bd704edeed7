VHis voice is robust, pushing melody and aesthetics to second placeSwarajhari Sabha organised Pattabhirama Pandit&#8217;s first concert in Vijayawada at Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram. Coming from Bangalore, Pattabhirama had his musical training from veterans like Vallabham Kalyana Sunderam, S. Ramanadhan, K.V. Narayana Swamy and Padma Narayana Swamy.The concert started withViriboniata tala varnam in Bhairavi, followed byAbhimanamennaduof Patnam in Begada. Next, Pattabhirama Pandit sang a fine version of Pantuvarali in which the keertanaNinne Neranamminanuwas marked by superb neraval and swaras.His Yadukula Kambhoji delineation was sung with great expertise as the raga is a challenging one, even for the well versed vidwans.The kritiHetcharikaga rara, sung in unusually vilambit tempo, amply proved Pattabhirama&#8217;s depth of scholarship.His voice is robust and tuneful but his vigorous singing pushed melody and aesthetics to second place.Next Pattabhirama sang a bhajan composed by Ganapathi Satchidananda Swamy,Dattatreya Trimoorti Rupa, in Ranjani andBrovabharamain Bahudari which was finished with fine kalpana swaras. For the main item, Pattabhirama Pandit chose Keeravani, singing the keertanaKaligiyunte, adorning it with superb alapana, fine neraval and intricate swara kalpana patterns.R. Dinakar who supported on violin and K. Sadgurucharan on the mridangam provided strong congenial support to the vocalist. Dinakar&#8217;s raga versions of Yadukula Kambhoji and Keeravani were hauntingly melodious and Sadgurucharan, an experienced mridangam artiste, excelled both in following and tani.Pattabhirama closed his concert with a few devotional songs andJagadidharanain Kafi, a popular PurandaraDas composition.
