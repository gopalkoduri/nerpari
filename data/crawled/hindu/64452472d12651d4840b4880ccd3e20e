VSatguru Sangeeta Samajam conducted a three day mini-music festival in the last week of November. Vocalist Sriram Parthasarathy began with Sudhanandha Bharati's &#8216;Eppadi Paadinaro,' in Bhimplas. His niraval of the phrase, &#8216;Mardhana, Kalinga Nardhana' from the song, &#8216;Swagatham Krishna' was appreciable, supported as it was by the expertly played tabla of Basavaraja Ganesha Rao.The singer made an impression with popular rhythmic numbers such as, &#8216;Idadhu Padam Thooki,' &#8216;Alai Paayudhe' and &#8216;Krishna Nee.' Tiruvarur Bakthavatsalam on the mridangam added spice to the proceedings and M. Subramanyam on the ghatam responded with ease. The concert ended on an unusual note with &#8216;Bhagyata Lakshmi Baramma,' as he sang it both in Hindustani and Carnatic styles in Subha Pantuvarali and Madhyamavathi alternately.Winning audience overDelineations of Carnatic and Hindustani ragas were the highlights of the jugalbandhi by Mangalore Rafiq khan on the sitar and Attukal Balasubramanyam on the violin, with Rajendra Nakod on the tabla, G.Babu on the mridangam and Adichanallur M. Anil Kumar on the ghatam.The excellence of the instrumentalists and the challenges they posed to each other were appreciated by the audience, as they played similar pairs of ragas such as Jog and Nattai, Shojan Kalian and Yamuna Kalyani. They alternated in taking the lead and closed each presentation with superb felicity.Simple and liltingO.S.Arun's beginning with &#8216;Prabho Ganapathe' by Agathiyar in Tilang proved soothing and gentleMany of his selections were strongly emotive pieces such as Koteeswara Iyer's &#8216;Arul Seyya Vendum' in Rasikapriya and Dikshitar's &#8216;Akilandeswari' in Dwijavanthi.The listeners warmed up to the attractive patterns in his alapana of Natabhairavam as much as they did to the simple and lilting lyrics of his bhajans. Ambujam Krishna's &#8216;Chinna Chinna Padam' in Kapi and Oothukadu Venkata Subbaiyer's &#8216;Swagatham Krishna' in Mohanam were some of his final pieces.Tiruchi R. Govindarajan on the violin provided able support while Kudandhai Saravanan on the mridangam and Tiruchi Krishnan on the ghatam provided ample energy to the concert.
