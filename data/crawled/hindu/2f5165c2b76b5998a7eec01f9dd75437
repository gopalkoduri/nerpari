VThe artistes showed their skill on the instrument by choosing aptragasfor the evening.&#8216;Aarabhi&#8217;, the Centre for Performing Arts run by Ashok Gurjale presented a violin concert by two youngsters Parsa Rukmin Datta Sai and  Ramavarapu Chandramouli (he just finished his engineering).Both are talented and key disciples of Ashok Gurjale.  The concert was held at Thyagaraya Gana Sabha recently.The artistes were accompanied by  P.Ramachandra Sarma on mridangam, S.T.P.Vijay Sarathy on ghatam and  Jay Kumar Acharya on kanjira and morsing. These percussionists who are seniors and have accompanied various artistes supported and guided the young violinists whenever they slipped on rhythm.Jay Kumar Acharya got thunderous applause for his performance on kanjira, morsing and konakolu (art of orally rendering the rhythm).The artistes showed their skill on the instrument by choosing aptragasfor the evening.Varnamin Natakuranjiraga, which was the opening piece was followed byMaha Ganapathim, in Nataraga. They then went on to play Thyagaraya&#8217;s compositionSeetamma maayammain Vasantharagamset to Roopakataal.The compositionGyana mosgaradhain Poorvikalyani gave a feeling that the artistes did not rehearse well as there were gaps in presentation and intaal.The duo played well especially the compositionBagayenayyaof Thyagaraya inraagChandrajyoti, which is not an easyraagto perform.TheswarasinRaagHamsadvani for the well known composition of Muthuiswamy DeekshitarVatapi Ganapathimwas the highlight of the evening, with both the artistes showing excellent coordination. Same was the case for their rest of the compositions likeRaghuvamsa sudhain Kadhanakuthuhalamraag,Muddugare YashodainraagKuranji, Anamayya&#8217;s composition,Adigo alladigoandTillanain Brindvaniraagperformed after a short break. They showed their skill and talent on the instrument.The keen interest and dedication of guru Ashok Gurjale needs to be appreciated as he was there in the auditorium to encourage his disciples in spite of a major surgery he underwent a fortnight ago.
