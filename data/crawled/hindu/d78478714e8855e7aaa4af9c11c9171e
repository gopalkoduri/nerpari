VSpic Macay's 26th National Convention, held recently at the Ravenshaw University Campus of Cuttack in Orissa, revealed definite signs of the organisation's unrelenting efforts at exposing youth to the real nature of the awesome variety of our art and culture traditions. Exposed to the best in performing arts, crafts, yoga and films, youngsters have begun to get a feel of the wellsprings of energy acquired through a lifetime journey in art, as in 82-year-old Girija Devi's trilling voice soaring in ecstasy singing &#8220;Tero Gopal Manena Baat&#8221; or &#8220;Barsan lage Badariyan&#8221;, carrying the rich aroma of Benaras culture through Thumri, Kajri and Jhoola. Sheer wonderment greets the power of the singing emerging from the bent frail form of the much-above-100-year old Abdul Rashid Khan. Equally amazing was the streamlined dancing figure with immaculate dance lines and impeccable Bharatanatyam stance of 74-year-old veteran C.V. Chandrasekhar presenting a marathon Shankarabharanam varnam &#8220;Manavi Cheko&#8221;. It was accompanied by Hariprasad's mood-evocative, silken voice spinning variations round each musical line with Anil Kumar's mridangam clarity in the tightly-knit teermanams with changing rhythmic accents.The youth involvement could be gauged through some of the responses. A telling moment was when a child of about 10 spontaneously stood up to applaud Carnatic musician T.V. Shankaranarayanan's Hymavati and Periazhwar's composition from the Naalaayira Divya Prabandham set to Hamsanandi. After the Bharatiyar lyric in Jonepuri &#8220;Yeppo varuvaaro&#8221; the standing ovation from students was an eye-opener of how the North/South divide (though one cannot avoid feeling that Carnatic music is still only an also-ran in Spic Macay) is being bridged by the opening up of young minds to subtleties of music. The other significant moment was to watch students paying obeisance and lustily cheering the unalloyed &#8216;Delhi gharana' wonder reflected in Pakistani vocalist Ustad Naseeruddin Saami. To hear him singing the Krishna myth with words like &#8220;Yashoda tose ladoongi&#8221; exemplified musical bonds transcending religio/cultural differences.Warmly receivedThe packed Heritage Hall reverberated with applause with the high vigour of Kerala's Ottan-Tullal by Kalamandalam Mohanakrishnan, his histrionic ability involving the viewers in the &#8220;Kalyana Sowgandhikam&#8221; excerpt of the Bhima/Hanuman encounter &#8212; a much enacted myth in Kerala's performing traditions. Also warmly received was Methil Devika's Mohiniattam, the subtle abhinaya spun around the word &#8216;moha' highlighting the enchantment sans sensuality of Mohini, around which Mohiniattam is based. Treating Swati Tirunal's Bhairavi &#8220;Ramachandra Prabho tum bin praye&#8221; from the Bharata point of view showed today's Mohiniattam taking on more than a female-centered tone. Kapila Venu's Koodiyattam showing &#8220;Parvati Viraham&#8221; was the third corner of this Kerala tradition triangle. The slow meditative build-up to Parvati's decision to leave her husband, and her immersed enactment perched precariously on the stool as a trembling Parvati had the audience in bated breath. Dadi Padumjee's excellent lec/dem on puppetry showed how even a shoe and a bag could become animated beings. In the &#8216;intensives', what was presented through raw students by using the inspiration of Orissa's shadow puppets, beautifully visualised the Tree of Life and Creativity with a sound tape of recited lines from Lalita Sahasranamam. Ileana Citaristi's workshop concentrated on basics of Odissi theory/practice while Rita Devi tried to give students a feel of Mahari Naach, as Pankajcharan Das' student. Aruna Mohanty's workshop effort was Konaraka Kanti, a sabda/swara/patha interpretation comprising basic movements and stances of Odissi temple sculpture &#8212; a bunch of four students in the large group seeming to have backgrounds of previous training. Very impressive was the presentation by Ramahari's students. Also, evocative was his own singing in the duet with Vijay Jena. Sujata Mohapatra, the reigning queen of Odissi, bewitched with her stage presence and grace in the Bageshwari Yugmadhwanda based on Raghunath Panigrahi's score with Ratikant's choreography, and the Ardhanariswara reveling in lasya/tandav contrasts as brilliantly choreographed by late genius Kelucharan Mohapatra. Also excellent was Jayadev Das' lighting and Swapneswar Chakravarthy's singing. besides her dulcet voice, Ashwini Bhide's shared wisdom with students in the intensives outlined the situational mood changes among the different Malhars.
