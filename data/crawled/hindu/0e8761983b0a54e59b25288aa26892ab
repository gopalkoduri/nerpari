VSangeetha Ksheerasagaram, a very active music sabha functioning from Thyagaraya Gana Sabha celebrated the Jayanthis of the renowned music trinity  -   Syama Sastry, Mutthuswami Deekshitar and Thyagaraja, last week on three consecutive days. Thyagaraya Gana Sabha co-sponsored the programme. A lecture on Thyagaraja's contribution to Carnatic music by Mulukutla Brahmananda Sastry of Tenali marked the event. It was called `Thyagaraaja Darsanam'. He spoke on life and times of Thyagaraja and also on his Kirtana Sahityam, in which he did research and secured Ph.D. D.
