VPriya Sisters,  Shanmugapriya and  Haripriya, transported the music admirers  of Pondicherry to the world of ecstasy by their impressive vocal recital recently  at the Sri Sankara Vidyalaya premises,  Pondicherry town. The programme was organised by Pondicherry-based Bhairavi Carnatic Music Circle which will be  celebrating its silver jubilee next year. The Priya Sisters were accompanied on the violin by M. A. Krishnaswami, on the mridangam by Neyveli Skandasubramaniam and on the ghatam by Madipakkam Murali.The Music Circle, which now has  225 members, has been organising music programmes every month.  V. Mahalingam, secretary,  stressed that the city needed an auditorium,  referring to the  difficulties his organisation  faced  to book one in advance.  This would help organisations schedule their programmes, he added.  He was of the opinion that the government, through the Department of Art and Culture, could work out a plan. The school, Societe Progressiste, in the heart of the town was  generally the  venue.  But the premises of Sri Sankara Vidyalaya premises  also attracted a large audience, Mahalingam said.The sabha also communicates to its members the programme schedule, along with the full text of  Tyagaraja kirtanas  and  its explanation  on  one side of the letter. One of the members said this  inspired music lovers to preserve the letters  as it helped  them to follow the songs.S. NADARAJANBottom Template Starts
