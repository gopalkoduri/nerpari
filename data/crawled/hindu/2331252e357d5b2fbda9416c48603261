VG. SWAMINATHANSivaram Arunachalam's voice has an appealing timbre.   A disciple of T.P.Vaidyanathan, who teaches aspirants music in its chaste form, Sivaram has a clear diction and the delivery is marked by composure.The songs Sivaram had selected were good on their own &#151;   `Sarasuda' (Saveri) varnam in two speeds, `Mooladharamurthy' in Hamsadhwani and `Enta Muddo' in Bindumalini to start with. But the recital lacked energy as   the presentations  moved at a slow pace. Only when Sivaram entered the freewheeling sancharas of Dharmavati, with an eye on the raga bhava, did the flow pick up.  The niraval and swaras at `Niravathi Sukha Dayukuni' added liveliness followed by a majestic `Vanajaksha' in Gambira Nattai with swara sahitya mode, a beautiful composition by Mysore Sadasiva Rao. The long winding `Bhavayami Raghuramam' was in fact misplaced, as it made inroads into the time of the main raga, Thodi. This led Arunachalam to go for a condensed package of an otherwise good Thodi with hastily moving `Koluvamaragatha,' almost  brushing aside sangatis, niraval and swaras. Careful planning will surely help Sivaram make better impact.Arunachalam's manodharama is fresh in alapana but the swara permutations should show more ingenuity.Neela Jayakumar extended violin support with remarkable perception while Jayakumar maintained the spirit of the concert on mridangam well. The concert was arranged by Brahma Gana Sabha at the Narada Gana Sabha mini hall.Bottom Template Starts
