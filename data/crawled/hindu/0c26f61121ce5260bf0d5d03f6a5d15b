VHindustani vocal recital abounds beyond a fixed time frame. Essentially creative in nature, it moves on from one plane to the other with the lyric playing a negligible role in rendition except perhaps in a thumri or dadra.. To try and fix up twin concerts within three hours would do justice to neither the musician nor his medium. And in trying to live up to the allocated slot, the artiste would be obliged to present short devotionals with a classical touch to justify his background. This is exactly what happened in &#8216;Santavani' a classical concert organised by the Gowda Saraswath Samaj recently.Shriniwas Joshi and M. Balachandra Prabhu shared the stage one after another and though both were artistes of calibre in their own way, neither could render his full potential for want of time. Joshi, blessed with a mellifluous tonal quality gave an in-depth rendition of the raag Puryadhanashree ( Ab tho rutmaan aaye&#8230;) wherein he scaled brilliant heights of the raag gradually in bhol taan, followed by swar taan and finally aakaar taan with the stress on the &#8216;nishad' which is the soul of the raag. The khayal in three cycles elaborated the melodic raag (sayya mora paradeso nainva&#8230;'. To his credit it must be mentioned that he went by the pulse of the audience in giving equal importance to the lyric and improvisation facilitating instant appreciation. His devotionals were also laced with the touch of the classical taans. &#8216;Bhagyada Lakshmi baramma&#8230;' a favourite in the Karnataka region was a hit with the listeners especially with his stylistic handling. Another Purandhara Dasa composition on Udipi Krsna in druth kaal was pleasing. Sanjay Marurkar on the tabla and Rahul Despande on the harmonium were in tune with the artiste.M.Balachandra Prabhu opened his recital in Madhyalay in raag Shudh Kalyan with an alaap in deep tones which was very captivating. The potency of his strong voice came to the fore as he explored the taan extensively. The very next composition was a bhajan Hari&#8230;.nirantara which was also rendered in the classical mode though a little more clarity in diction would be welcome. The Vittala vittala sudhachi swaroopi&#8230; went well with the audience. His roots to Kirana gharana were evident in the emphasis he gave to elongating the notes thereby stressing on resonance rather than the lyric proper.The concert was hosted at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.
