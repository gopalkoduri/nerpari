VVeenothsava, a two-day festival, was held at the Infosys Hall (Ramakrishna Mission High School).Thirty two artists participated and each artist was given half-an-hour to perform -- a daunting task. Four artists (chosen at random) from the afternoon session of the second day had this to offer.G.R.S. Murthy began with an alapana of Mandhari. His Devamanohari had telling phrases that drew the listener to Tyagaraja's &#8216;Evarikai.' Thiruvidaimarudhur Sankaran and Madipakkam Murali were on the mridangam and the ghatam respectively.Unhurried paceBangalore-based Radhika Bhaskar presented &#8216;Varasikivahana,' an ekaika kriti of Tyagaraja, in Supradeepam, which was set in as languid a pace as one can imagine. Her final number, a novel one, was Mysore Doraisamy Iyengar's note, composed in Sindhubhairavi. The raga elaboration for Simhendramadhyamam was neatly executed. The accompanists were Thanjavur Subramaniam (mridangam) and Venkatasubramaniam (ghatam).Ananthanarayanan's performance had stately gamakas as he played Poorvikalyani (&#8216;Gnanamosagaradha', Tyagaraja), while Kannadagowla (&#8216;Orajoopu,' Tyagaraja) had bhava in full stream. Umayalpuram Mali accompanied him on the mridangam. Jayalakshmi Sekhar had enough space to capture and present Thodi (&#8216;Koti Nadhulu', Tyagaraja) with its weighty phrases and grandeur. She began with &#8216;Sri Santhanagopalakrishnam' (Dikshitar, Khamas). The host, Mudhra Bhaskar was on the mridangam. The last two sessions had Pudukottai Ramachandran on the ghatam.The four vainikas proved that half-hour concerts can hold your attention. There were no repetitions and the artists were recognised individually for the various intensities of the mettus and their assimilation of the kritis and ragas. Preparedness seemed the key determinant, but quality was never at stake. Reverential attention wasn't lacking and the subtle intricacies that surfaced grew impressively upon one's mind.The combined effort of Mudhra and Brahma Gana Sabha in organising this major event exemplified how sabhas can function in unison.While rich praise is due to the organisers for this venture, allotting an hour for an artist seems reasonable for a sensitive instrument, such as the veena. Also, a short profile on the artists and their gurus would have helped.However, this festival was a laudable tribute to this traditional yet evolved instrument!
