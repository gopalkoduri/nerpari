Gopalan on mridangam.Subba Rao opened with Bhairavi atatala varnam- Viriboni in two speeds and went for an invocation Pranamamyaham in Gowla of Mysore Vasudevachar. The nereval and detailed swaraprasthara added musical weight to the number. He then took up raga Saranga and gave a brief sketch of it for Neevaada Negaana of Thyagaraja set in Jhumpe talam he rendered with alacrity. Vinave O Manasa in Vivardhini was a rare number from him. He then went for the first detailed ragaalapana of Latangi for Aparadhamulu of Patnam in Adi talam. The swarakalpana part was done in sarvalaghu technique. Bhairavi was his main essay of the concert which he essayed with utmost care and packed it with sensitive nuances. He took good time to develop it in all the octaves. Ika Nannu Brovakunna of pallavi Seshayyer was a pleasant number he chose to present in this raga. He was conscious of its sahitya and brought out its mood well. The neraval he presented at the line Bhavasagaramandu Munigi added to the strength of his expression. The swarakalpana was a neat exercise. The final number of the concert was a rare composition of Ramadasa Bhajare Manasa Ramam in Kaanada, he himself set to music.
