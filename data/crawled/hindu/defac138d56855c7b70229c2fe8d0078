VThe soul of Carnatic music rests on its subtle aesthetic relevance.  When the rakti of a raga and the beauty of a kirtana are well visualised, the voice becomes endearingly open to music's charms.Versatility notwithstanding, a musician has to check the temptation to display his/her vocal prowess. Singing in the Sri Rama Navami series for Asthika Samajam, T.M.Krishna found even at the very start a healthy rhythm, which he maintained throughout. Part of this effort was due to the list of Tyagaraja kirtanas he rendered. His exposition reflected style and substance, but never soared to great heights.In the raga alapanas of Bilahari and Kharaharapriya, Krishna's focus seemed to be on passionate phrasings and not on the wellspring of serenity. Technical and vocal skills were in full view in his manodharma and raga delineation.In contrast, the solo violin versions by Varadarajan had a  captured arresting images  through balance and grace. It was the lyricism of Bilahari and well-sculpted Karaharapriya pidis that made his presentation top-class.The Sankarabharanam song, `Bhakti Bichcha Meeyyave" and the Suddha Bangala piece, "Rama Bhakti" gave a flying start. "Dorakuna Ituvanti Seva" (Bilahari) was marked by flowing sangatis with spirited neraval for the lines "Rama Brahma Tanayudu". This was followed by the monumental "Chakkani Maarga" (Kharaharapriya).The pattern of percussion support for these kritis from T. K. Murthy (mridangam) and Purushothaman (kanjira) was flashy and robust.SVKBottom Template Starts
