VA tryst with Amrutha Venkatesh&#8217;s vocal recital invariably leaves you wonder-struck at the artist&#8217;s maturity that is far in advance of her years. Her  seamless integration of the art and science of the classical genre makes her music a connoisseur&#8217;s delight - music that pays homage to the dignity and timelessness of the art form.With a Thodi raga alapana that served as a shining illustration of the artist&#8217;s dedication and commitment to enduring values, it was a win-win concert all the way. Thodi made a subdued, even conventional entry, but what a stunning swaroopa it assumed! Kalapramana is as central to alapana as it is to kriti, or to  swarakalpana or to  niraval. Only, more subtle in its manifestation. It is the juxtaposition of tonal and gait contrasts that paints light and shade - the chiaroscuro of nuances and emotions.Amrutha&#8217;s essay at her performance at the Vani Mahal for Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha was an outstanding example of an admixture of different gaits that radiated varying energies. Nurtured by gnana and bhava, nascent form stirred to life in the heavy coils encasing the mandra sthayi and shadja-madhyama suite  of the madhya sthayi. The magnificent continuity of nagaswaram phrasing entwined the panchama, creating sumptuous leitmotifs.The  kalapramana invoked majesty, dispelling the  notion that relentless speed spells maximum appeal. Madhyamakala akara phrasing strode the royal path to the tara sthayi shadja. Not that brigas were missing.  Ozone content peaked in the higher reaches which were as much about vistara as about fearless exploration.Whether in clearly articulated lyric, the weighty sway of chittaswaram or the gripping rounds of niraval and kalpanaswara with kuraippu at the panchama, the kriti &#8216;Gajavadana&#8217; held you in thrall.Earlier, the solidity of patanthara-reinforced compositions formed the backbone of the recital. &#8216;Sugunamule&#8217; (Chakravaham) supported kalpanaswara that slid smoothly  into smooth grooves, locking effortlessly into position. &#8216;Ananda Natana Prakasam&#8217; (Kedaram) and &#8216;Bhajanaseyu Margamunu&#8217; (Narayani) were stand-alone kritis. Manodharma flowered delicately in Purvikalyani that cruised over a gradual incline to gather momentum from the panchama terrain,  leading to prayogas at the tara-sthayi gandhara that flamed with an intensity to meld artist and listener. L.Ramakrishnan&#8217;s Purvikalyani stood out for endorsing the same irreproachable values as Amrutha&#8217;s. Arjun Ganesh (mridangam) kept pace with Amrutha&#8217;s discoveries with scintillating strokes.
