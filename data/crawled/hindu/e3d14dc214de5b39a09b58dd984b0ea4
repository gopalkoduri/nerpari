Nayak on the harmonium. Nayak took control of the concert at certain phases with the consent of the vocalist. The padam &#8216;Morae Mandir Nahin' was excellently played by him. The bhava and laya that Nayak infused into the piece was memorable.Easy glidesThis was followed by a short piece &#8211;&#8216;Bahuth Din Beethe Ajahoo Na Aaye' in Puriya Kalyan, which was set to teen taal.
