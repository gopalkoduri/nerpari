VFor the first time Gnyana Mudra (Ph: 98414 54755) has come out with devotionals on Lord Muruga. Pace marks the eight songs rendered by as many singers in the album titled, &#8216;Singaara Chilaiazhagan,&#8217; penned by S. Baskar and composed by S.M.\u000aSubramaniam.With easy flowing gamakas and smooth improvisations in Saindhavi&#8217;s voice, the pallavi of the opening number is alluring.  If you can ignore the abrupt pauses in the BGM of &#8216;Valli Kurathikku&#8217; the melody per se interests you.  Be it V. Kumar&#8217;s sober presentation of &#8216;Ayyanae&#8217; or the slow start of &#8216;Deva Deva Ganam&#8217; (Mahadevan), the beats are indeed catchy. Comparatively, Anuradha Shekher&#8217;s piece sounds flat.  Typically traditional in style is singer Rajalakshmi&#8217;s &#8216;Shanmuganandha.&#8217; Strangely, the title song, placed seventh in the order, makes little impact. As for the final piece, the joyous refrain of Harini Sudhakar brings to your mind&#8217;s eye an ebullient heroine prancing around &#8212; of course it does offer some religious flavour too. On the whole, a morale boosting exercise that takes the devotional route!To listeners of devotional discs, L. Krishnan is a familiar name. Abirami Recording Company has produced an album named, &#8216;Thiru Arutpa&#8217; (Part 1) (Ph: 044 24361485). Simple, lucid and absorbing, Vallalar&#8217;s lyrics are the most captivating feature of the audio CD. While &#8216;Suprabhatam,&#8217; &#8216;Jothi &#8230;&#8217; (based on the harathi tune of the North, &#8216;Om Jai Jagadish Hare&#8217;), and &#8216;Vaanathin Meedhu,&#8217; are on regular lines, (with the last mentioned appealingly similar to the evergreen film number, &#8216;Masilla Nilavae Nam&#8217; in Maand) the background score of most of the songs sounds alike. And nearly all of them are like the innumerable devotionals you get to listen to on All India Radio, lending themselves to dance, with the bells in the background completing the scenario. &#8216;Orumaiyudan &#8230;&#8217; makes you nostalgic, as you recall the melodious manner in which Soolamangalam Rajalakshmi rendered it years ago. But here it&#8217;s a fast beat song. The range of the voices seems to have been given the go by, what with the singers at times struggling with a pitch too low for comfort. Mahati and Jayashri are the singers.Bottom Template Starts
