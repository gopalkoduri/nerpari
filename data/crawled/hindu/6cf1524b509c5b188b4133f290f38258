VB. RAMADEVIThe beautifully decorated stage, the spacious pandal and the welcoming open ground at Jaivabai Higher Secondary School, Tiruppur, hospitably took in the visitors streaming in to participate in `Isai Amudham-2007 ' a five-day musical festival, organised by Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha, Tiruppur.Priya Sisters, Haripriya and Shanmukhapriya, made an impressive beginning on the first day. They began with the cheerful Abhogi varnam. After the spirited `Karunai Seivai, Gajaraja Mukha' in Hamsadhwani (Papanasam Sivan), they moved on to the softly moving, `Muruga Muruga Endraal' in Saveri after a brief delineation of the raga.Sunadhavinodhini was presented a little more elaborately. The sisters took time to etch out Thodi with care and poured life into the immortal kriti `Thaamadhamen Swami'  by Papanasam Sivan.  However, the pieces that really impressed the crowd were `Sriranganatha Guru Sevai Kaana,' `Om Namo Bagavathe Vaasudevaaya,' `Gandamu Puyyaruga' and `Brahmamokate.'  These pieces pleased everyone with their sheer melody and the artistes' masterly presentation.M.A. Krishnaswamy's violin was smooth and restrained. Skanda Subramaniam on the mridangam and Tiruchi Murali on the ghatam gave a memorable treat to the audience.When Rag Basant wafted in the air, through the deft fingers of Rajhesh Vaidhya, one looked forward to listen to more of such peace-invoking melody. But, Rajhesh had different plans.An ardent disciple of Chittibabu, Rajhesh has chosen to shape himself as the `showman' and entertainer. He can give melting music, but he surprised  listeners with his  phrases and  sancharas.Scintillating musicThe admiration he earned while playing the Mohana raga varnam `Ninnu Kori' at nine speeds, grew steadily to a crescendo and culminated in a standing ovation when he concluded with the subduing refrain `Jaya Jaya Sankara, Hara Hara Sankara.' The sample compositions of Mozart, Beethoven and Bach (all in Kiravani) that he played preceding his own composition in the same raga were melodious. While his RTP in Panthuvarali on Kanchi Paramacharya was steeped in devotion, his lighter session consisted of scintillating Carnatic based film songs of yesteryear such as `Vellipanimalaiyin Meethu.'   Mohanram (mridangam), Chandrajit (tabla), Subramaniam (ghatam and special effects), Sriram (keyboard) and Sriram Ramesh (rhythm pad) did a commendable job, enhancing Rajesh Vaidhya's performance.One could hear murmurs from orthodox rasikas as to what kind of music was that, but the crowd that stayed on clapping jubilantly, thought differently.Bottom Template Starts
