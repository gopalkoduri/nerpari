VT he &#8216;Parampara' Festival of Music and Dance held in aid of Home of Hope Children's Home, presented a Bharatanatyam recital of senior dancer-teacher, Indira Kadambi.A disciple of Gurus Janardhan Sharma, Usha Datar, Narmadha, Savitri Jagannath Rao and Kalanidhi Narayanan, Indira has developed her own brand of impish effervescence that can be seen in her as confident, vivacious movements and fluid expressions.It was a pleasure to watch the combined skill of the artists, who gave sterling performances without much ado.Exciting sectionOutwardly there was no conscious effort to get it right, though they did, every time. The rhythmic sections that had been enhanced with teasing pauses, off-beats and racy beats were especially exciting, with the percussionist's (Ramesh Babu) cues, the nattuvanar's (dancer Praveen Kumar) calm accuracy and the dancer's energy coming together in perfect synchrony. The varnam (compilation of verses from Sri Krishna Karnamrutham in Ritigowla, Adi, tuned by Tirumalai Srinivas) was a devotional piece. It introduced Krishna in an interesting way, with the depiction of the seven avatars preceding the Krishna avatar, before detailing the circumstances of His birth.Indira's retelling was clear and cohesive, but did not go beyond good acting. Where she showed her true depth was in the Jayadeva's Ashtapadi, &#8216;Pashyati disi disi' (Desh, misra chapu) where Radha's friend describes her pitiful &#8216;impassioned' state to Krishna. The &#8216;Kalanidhi style' of suggestive emoting came to the fore, with understated yet powerful gestures.The music was divine and soothing throughout. One only wished for clearer intonation from Radha Badri (vocal).The instrumentalists Eshwar Ramakrishnan (violin) and B. Muthukumar (flute) enhanced the experience. The percussionist was notable for his soft treatment in the Ashtapadi, while the nattuvanar was a low-key precise guide all evening.
