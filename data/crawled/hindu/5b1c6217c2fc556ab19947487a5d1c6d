VG. SWAMINATHANIt was a celebration of Varali as Suguna Purushothaman in her Indian Fine Arts Society lecture-demonstration presented the raga in all its manifestations &#151;   Panthuvarali, Kokilavarali, SubaPanthuvarali, Kuntalavarali, Prathapavarali, Jalavarali, Vasanthavarali, Punnagavarali and Varali. Among these, Kokila, Prathapa, Jala and Vasantha varalis are less handled by composers. Kokila varali with a twisted arohanam and avarohanam is a challenge.Nevertheless, Suguna recited catchy combinations of these twisted notes in a careful and aesthetic manner to impress on the peculiarity as well as beauty of it.The lone Tyagaraja number, `Samukhana Nilva,' in this raga which bears a close resemblance to Margahindolam was rendered. Jalavarali with flat notes is represented by `Anatha Rakshaha Guha' by Koteeswara Iyer as this is the 39th melakarta ragam.  Suguna rendered `Sri Ramachandram Bhajare' of Vasudevachar.Vasanathavarali was used by Tyagaraja in only one composition `Pahi Rama Dhootha' and Prathapavarali in `Vinanasa Koni.'Panthuvarali and Varali have been much in vogue. Panthuvarali being considered a bright raga (51st melakartha) is named Kamavardhini. Suguna and her students presented several numbers to highlight the special charm of Panthuvarali as used by different composers.How raga becomes vividStarting her programme with `Sami Ninne,' varnam in Adi talam, and `Chalamuse' in Ata talam by Ponniah Pillai, Suguna emphasised here how the raga becomes vivid with the stress on madhyama and dhaivatam and how it differs from Poorvikalyani.The permutations and combinations made in these two varnams were amazing and showed how the notes of Panthuvarali could be handled.Of the several songs rendered two  stood out for their rare appearance and lilting style &#151;  `Saroruhasana Jaaye,' a Navarathri kriti by Swati Thirunal and `Sonnadhai Kel Kanna' by Oothukadu Venkatakavi.SubaPanthuvarali which inherently carries a melancholic flavour also goes well with flat notes rather than with much of pull (asaivu). Suguna illustrated that the raga (45th melakarta) nevertheless has been very much in vogue with popular numbers such as `Sri Satyanarayanam' and `Pasupatheeswaram' by Dikshitar and `Ennalu Oorage' by Tyagaraja.Kunatalvarali on the contrary, Suguna demonstrated, is dynamic and zestful with the characteristic usage of sa ma pa da ni da sa.'The catchy numbers like Sarasara Samare,' `Chendane Sada' by Tyagaraja, `Bogindra Sayeenam' by Swati Tirunal and a breezy tillana by Balamuralikrishna were presented.Punnagavarali, a nishathanthya ragam is equally popular, Suguna explained and rendered `Kanakasaila Viharini' by Syama Sastri which showcased the raga's beauty.Varali which is most dominant on concert platforms has its pride of place in the Pancharatnam, `Kana Kana Ruchira,' Suguna said.She observed how the vivadhi swaras need to be beautified in singing this raga and gave several samples like `Seshachala Nayakam,' `Mamava Kamakshi' by Dikshitar, `Ka Va Va' by Sivan and `Kamakshi Nannu Brova' and concluded with her own (impromptu?) composition `Varalippodu' on Mookambika.Suguna's down to earth explanation, neat and soulful rendition by her students Gayathri, Mythili, Nandini, Saranya and Sowmya with Kaushik on the flute and vocal with understanding percussion support from Thanjavur Kumar on the mridangam made it a worthwhile experience.Bottom Template Starts
