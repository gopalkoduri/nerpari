VYet another young girl bestowed with a voice that sounds like that of a veteran! The musical ideas too are classically deep-rooted. J.B. Keerthana sang open-mouthed, a style that augurs well for Carnatic music.&#8216;Nada Tanumanisam' was slow paced yet gripping due to the overpowering voice.A well-interpreted Purvikalyani with an impressive niraval in the song &#8216;Gnanamosagaradha' was proof enough of her talent. The diction was perfect. Her approach at times reminded one of Sivananda Vijayalakshmi (a doyen of musical discourse). Considering her age, Kiravani alapana was approached with an incredible vishranthi.Disciplined approachKeeping company on the violin was Apoorva Krishna the young school girl from Bangalore. A disciplined approach saw her get through well during her replies. The rigorous training that she might have undergone was evident in her playing. &#8216;Amba Vani' (Muthaiah Bhagavatar) was sweet and so was her niraval for the kriti. The kalpanaswara segment was good up to a point.Although hailing from the U.S., Vikram Vasudevan played the mridangam with zest as if he were a lad from neighbourhood Mylapore. His moorings appear to be on the right track. His blows had a natural power and his thani was impressive.
