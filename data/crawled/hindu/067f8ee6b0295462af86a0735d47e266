VArundhathi Krishnan has an unconventional voice. It has a slight heavy tenor sans syrupiness, moves finely in madyama and mantra regions but with slight stress in tara sthayi, indeed a manageable weakness. But, what impresses one is Arundhati&#8217;s clear diction, uncomplicated approach and her ingenuity in raga development.In her concert for Nada Inbam at Raga Sudha Hall, Arundhati essayed Dhanyasi with just a few strong phrases for a little known Tyagaraja kriti, &#8216;Syama Sundaranga.&#8217; Adding a few rounds of kalpanaswaras in Rudrapriya, &#8216;Gananayakam&#8217; of Dikshitar was preceded by GNB&#8217;s Nalinakanti varnam &#8216;Neeve Gathi.&#8217;Arundhati took some time to wamr up before she landed on Hamsanadam, which was given a special place in her concert with an elaborate essay exhibiting the organised and imaginative ability of Arundhati. &#8216;Bantu Reethi&#8217; of Tyagaraja was backed up by a niraval in &#8216;Rama Nama Mane&#8217; with an array of well-envisioned swaras.The main raga Bhairavi too followed similar approach with care and caution and the composition here was &#8216;Mylapuriyil Vanda Mahadevan&#8217;.Bhairavi shines when the exposition provides more room for kaarvai than rolling briga laden phrases.Arundhati could comprehend this and she developed a commendable image of the raga. Yet, she needs to concentrate more on the pause between the phrasings and the landing of each phrase with right precision.Similarly, better voice modulation of her strong vocal prowess could help her in creating the overall impact of her singing.&#8216;Sarasa Dala Nayana&#8217; in Khamas by Dikshitar and &#8216;Parakelanayya Rama&#8217; in Sama by Mysore Vasudevachar were mentionable additions to the concert.K.P. Harichandran sailed on the same boat like the vocalist. He also took some time to reach his confidence level, yet delivered Dhanyasi, Hamsanadam and Bhairavi with substantial emphasis on melodious passages. Kumbakonam Ramakrishnan&#8217;s mridangam sounded a little loud initially but sobered with the progress of the concert.
