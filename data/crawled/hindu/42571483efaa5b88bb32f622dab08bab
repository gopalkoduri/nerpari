VCreative music contributes to the rich musical treasure of Carnatic music. Ragam-taanam-pallavi, which is considered an advanced level of creative music in concert singing, not only brings out the virtuosity of the artiste, but also adds lustre to a concert.At the ongoing Thyagaraja Music Festival in New Delhi organised by Sree Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha, Sreeram Prasad and Ravikumar, popularly known as the Malladi Brothers, proved this point. The brothers presented the pallavi &#8220;Karunajudara Kamalapati krupakara Srikrishna hare Madhava nanu&#8221; in raga Behag, set to Khanda Jati Triputa tala. Their proficiency in this branch of creative music came to the fore.Sreeram and Ravikumar together presented the raga alpana, bringing out its complete essence. Their taanam presentation was accompanied by percussion, something one felt was not required, as it would have been more comforting otherwise. The brothers finished the session with ragamallika swaraprastaras in ragas Behag, Saveri, Abheri, Mohanam and Suruti, both in forward and reverse orders, in a most fitting manner. Till this review was written, the Malladi Brothers were the only ones to include a ragam-taanam-pallavi in this festival and it turned out to be a grand affair, as it was reminiscent of Chennai's music season concerts, where ragam-taanam-pallavi is an integral part. The organisation should insist on inclusion of ragam-taanam-pallavi as Delhi audiences, more often than not, are deprived of this by visiting artistes.Earlier, the brothers took up &#8220;Kamadhenukam Ashraye&#8221; in raga Dhenuka and Tyagaraja's &#8220;Mahita Pravriddha&#8221; in raga Kambhoji for detailed rendering. While it was the elder sibling Sreeram Prasad, who delineated Dhenuka, Ravikumar, the younger brother, delineated Kambhoji. Both were outstanding presentations.They took up neraval elaboration right from the pallavi phrase of &#8220;Mahita Pravriddha&#8221; and then went into swaraprastaras. The finishing korvais (rhythmic patterns formed of notes, bringing the improvisation to a close in a thrice-repeated design) during the swaraprastara was appealing, as was the korvai with which they ended Dhenuka.The Malladi Brothers were ably accompanied by B. Raghavendra Rao on the violin, Manoj Siva on the mridangam and Alathur Rajaganesh on the kanjira. Raghavendra Rao's sketch of Kambhoji, in particular, was delightful. The tani avartanam (percussion solo) in Tisra Jati Triputa tala was riveting. In addition, all the supporting artistes contributed significantly to making the ragam-taanam-pallavi a splendid session.A disappointmentAt the &#8216;Music in Park' series, organised recently at the Capital's Nehru Park, Bombay Jayashree's performance was disappointing. In a brief concert of an hour or so before the cosmopolitan audience, out of eight songs presented, Jayashree packed as many as five, including &#8220;Jagadodharana&#8221;, &#8220;Krishna Nee Begane&#8221; and a tillana that are usually presented in the miscellaneous session of the concert. Swati Tirunal's &#8220;Devadeva Jagadeeswara&#8221; in raga Poorvikalyani was the opening piece, which was suffixed with crisp swaraprastaras. Tyagaraja's &#8220;Mokshamu galada&#8221; in the raga Saramati was emotively presented.However, Shyama Sastri's &#8220;Himadri sute pahimaam&#8221; in the raga Kalyani, being the central item, did not receive the kind of elaborate treatment that it deserved. Though her sketch of the raga was good, the neraval and subsequent swaraprastaras were very brief. Mysore Srikanth on the violin, J. Vaidhyanathan on the mridangam and Anirudh Athreye on the kanjira provided support to Jayashree. Tani avartanam (percussion solo) was conspicuous by its absence.
