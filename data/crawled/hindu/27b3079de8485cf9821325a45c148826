VA couple of years ago, Chitraveena Ravikiran had conducted a  musical workshop in Chennai, featuring the &#8216;Nava-avarana Kritis&#8217; of Oothukkadu Venkata Kavi,  where many subtle aspects of the lyrics and rhythms of the songs were brought out.Around the same time, a book written by Ravikiran on Venkata Kavi&#8217;s music had also been published revealing not only his clear and comprehensive understanding of the composer&#8217;s work, but also his own powers of lucid expression in English.Now Ravikiran has produced a set of two CDs  containing an excellent choral rendering of these songs by  Vintage Virtuosos. This  melodic ensemble has been  guided by him.  The CDs contain a dozen tracks, featuring the nine Avarana kritis and three songs of prayer. They are priced at Rs. 200.The merits of Venkata Kavi&#8217;s music in general, and the Nava-avarana Kritis in particular, were discussed in these pages in the context of Ravikiran&#8217;s workshop, with extensive quotations from his book &#8216;Oothukkadu Venkata Kavi&#8217;, including the following ones (Musicscan, Friday Review /online,www.thehindu.com, Sept. 28 and Oct. 12, 2007):Melodic vision: The spirit of Venkata Kavi&#8217;s melodic style is radiance.Lyrics and language: The most striking feature of the composers lyrics is the incredible combination of power and elegance that his words possess.Spirit and imagery: Venkata Kavi&#8217;s compositions... glow with the imagery he creates, the picture he paints with his brush of imagination that transports the connoisseur into a world of ethereal beauty.It is impossible to talk about these sacred compositions of Venkata Kavi and their dissemination without recalling the extremely valuable contribution made  by Mr. S. Sankaranarayanan, author of the book &#8216;Kamakshi Nava-avarana Kritis &#8211; A Study Of The Sahitya&#8217;, which explains not only the meaning of the lyrics, but also many intricate connotations of the songs. (It had been used by Ravikiran as a highly reliable text-book in his workshop).In a foreword to the book, which was published nine years ago, the following observations of Paramacharya were conveyed:&#8220;Sri Sankaranarayanan has taken great pains in bringing out the importance of each kriti, as can be seen from his introductory notes and translation in English... The meaning rendered by him for the kritis is crystal clear, and the foot-notes given are elucidative...&#8220;Devotees of Devi Kamakshi, music Sabhas and musicians will do well to take early steps to popularise these Nava-avarana Keertanas. It will be good if boys and girls decide to get by heart these kritis and make it a point to sing them in the Devi shrine of the Siva temple in the locality in which they are residing.&#8221;Along with the CD of  Vintage Virtuosos, this pioneering work will surely be a formidable aid for studying these beautiful songs!
