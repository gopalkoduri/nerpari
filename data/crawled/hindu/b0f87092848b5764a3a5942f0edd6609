VThe Navaratri kritis composed by Maharaja Swati Tirunal are celebrated for their prosodic beauty. Of the nine kritis in praise of Devi, the first six are dedicated to Saraswati and the last three to Parvati.The simple, elegant lyrics flow in graceful lines that employ time-honoured poetic devices such as prasa (rhyme), dvitiakshara prasa (alliteration in the second letter of each line) and adhyapada prasa (alliteration in the first segment) highlighted by the use of upama (simile), roopaka (metaphor) and utpreksha (fancy).The content encompasses praise for the deity (sthuti), a description of the goddess&#8217; attributes and a plea for unwavering devotion towards Devi (bhakti). The kritis are styled in the &#8216;Pahimam&#8217; mode, seeking divine protection from trials and tribulations, with the composer using the sambodhana vibhakthi (vocative case) and the prathama vibhakthi (nominative case).Each kriti has a short pallavi and anupallavi followed by multiple charanams. The first kriti has four charanams while the rest have three charanams each. The first six kritis have lengthy charanams while the last three kritis have charanams with a simpler, compact structure.The first six kritis are set to chowka kala (slow tempo) although madhyamakala passages feature at the close of the anupallavi or the charanams from the second kriti onwards. The last three kritis are set in madhyama kala (medium tempo). The middle three kritis are distinguished by the use of solkattu (rhythmic syllables) in the anupallavi.The compositions bring out the inherent grandeur, majesty and luminosity of the ragas in which they have been set &#8211; Sankarabharanam, Kalyani, Saveri, Thodi, Bhairavi, Pantuvarali, Suddhasaveri, Nattakurinji and Arabhi, through their gait and melodic structure. Among them, the Arabhi kriti is most favoured by musicians, possibly on account of the easy, effortless flow of lyric.A noteworthy aspect of the Kalyani kriti is the incorporation of characteristic features of Sopana Sangeetham.  Both the Kalyani and the Pantuvarali kritis are marked by the absence of mandhra sthayi (lower octave) sancharas.Schedule of Navaratri concertsSeptember 30: T.M.
