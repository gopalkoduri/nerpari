VA core of accountability ensures that Master Balamuralikrishna&#8217;s music steers clear of formulaic devices. It also allows his natural instincts to surface, making for unaffected fare and interesting interpretation. In his vocal recital for Vasan\u000atha Priya, a packed hall ensured a captive audience. The artiste made a definitive statement in Poorvikalyani which was structured with clarity of concept.Sruthi-aligned karvais and the use of akara in freewheeling sancharas juxtaposed areas of tranquillity and dynamism in equal measure in the shadja-panchama suite. If only the use of ukara had been avoided from time to time, there would have been a two-fold increase in the overall effect. A shower of mid-fast phrases descended from the tara-sthayi shadja. Respite came in the form of karvais at the gandhara and successive fast swirls carried the requisite punch.The niraval and swara patterns at &#8216;Paripoorna&#8217; in Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Gnanamu sagaradha&#8217; had an easy flow that sought aesthetics sans aggression. Syama Sastry&#8217;s mesmerising &#8216;Mayamma&#8217; showcased an Ahiri sung with an appreciable degree of involvement.The vocalist&#8217;s version of the Narayana Thirtha composition &#8216;Saranam bhava karunamayi&#8217; (Hamsavinodini) that one remembers MLV singing with characteristic verve, stood out for the imaginatively lined up sangathis in the charanam at the line &#8216;Adhunaakalu vidhinaamayi&#8217; while the swaras were explorative with sound judgment. In the main raga Kharaharapriya, the judicious use of varied elements including slow gamakas and agile brigas ensured a balanced picture. A bird&#8217;s eye view at the tara sthayi rishabha helped the artiste create a sense of vistara at the rishabha-panchama suite. Paying more attention to open-throated articulation would remedy the rather constricted quality of voice production that tended to surface at intervals.Intention coalesced with execution in the well-knit sangathis of Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8217;Pakkala nilabadi&#8217; which had an impassioned round of neraval and swaraprathara topped by a simple effective korvai.Nostalgia buffs found enough to keep them happy in the light section through songs such as &#8216;Muralidhara Gopala&#8217; that MLV invested with her unique brand of charm.Master Rajiv, a disciple of Kanyakumari maintained the thread of continuity during raga elaboration and scored with a detailed relaxed exposition of Kharaharapriya. Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar&#8217;s percussive permutations stood out for the use of the rhythmic syllables corresponding to the word &#8216;Manasuna&#8217; in his tani.Bottom Template Starts
