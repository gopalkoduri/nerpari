VR. Suryaprakash, a disciple of T.V. Sankaranarayanan, presented a sumptuous musical feast at G.K.D. Auditorium, Coimbatore, under the aegis of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts.Blessed with a voice that is melodious as well as dignified, he took care to retain the interest of the listeners by bringing variety in the choice of the compositions.He began with the less-heard varnam in Pantuvarali, &#8216;Sami Nee Thodi Deve' and proceeded with &#8216; Brovabaarama' in Bahudari. The authentic delineation of Durbar raga raised many guesses about the kriti he was going to sing.Suryaprakash surprised everyone when he sang, &#8216;Sri Venugopala Deva Nee Vaa' by Koteeswara Iyer.After presenting the rare &#8216;Swarnangi,' he rendered Mayuram Viswanatha Iyer's &#8216;Maha Raja Rajeswari Parvati.' &#8216;Maayamma Ani Nae Pilachithe' in Ahiri was an expression of pure devotion.When he began with the anu pallavi demanding explanation from the goddess, &#8216;Nyayama, Meenaakshamma' one could only envy Syama Sastri's intimacy with the Divine.Brisk renditionInterestingly, the following song by Tyagaraja also had a similar theme &#8216;Manavyalakincharadhate' in Nalinakanti. But this was presented briskly with swaras that poured in torrents.His concert reminded the audience of his mentor's guru, Madurai Mani Iyer.Suryaprakash sang the majestic &#8216;Chakkani Raja' as the main piece with an elaborate alapana, niraval and interesting combinations of swaras. He sketched Charukesi for his RTP, with the pallavi, &#8216;Then Pazhanimalai Velavaa Kaa Vaa Iru Disaiyin Isai Ketka.' He justified the words in the pallavi, &#8216;Iru Disaiyin Isai,' by singing the swaras in the Hindustani ragas and Carnatic ragas (Vada Disaiyin Isai and Then Disaiyin Isai).The lighter session had the intensely moving &#8216;Aiye Methakkadinam' from Nandanar Charithram, Purandaradasar's &#8216;Srikantha Enagishtu,' Papanasam Sivan's &#8216;Krishna Mukunda Muraare' and &#8216; Kandhan Karunai Puriyum Vadivel.'M.R. Gopinath allowed the nectar-like melody flow through his fingers as they danced on the violin strings. His lively imagination and mastery over the ragas filled his presentation with sowkya bhava. Mridangam by Thiruvananthapuram Vaidhyanathan was extremely smooth as he lent his support with sensitivity. His thani was brief but enjoyable.
