VIt was excellence and modesty at its best. For, when an artiste of Ustad Zakir Hussain's stature takes the stage, one would expect total monopolisation of the tabla. Not so Zakir. His flexibility is remarkable. He comes out in full flow in solo and can immediately switch over to subdued tones when in accompaniment with either the sarangi or sitar.The evening came alive at HICC with the &#8216;Live in Fusion', an ensemble of drums, sarangi, sitar and of course the tabla. The Ustad's brother, Taufiq Qureshi proved to be a wizard with the percussion. His was talent extraordinaire, as he set the stage ablaze with the sound of drums reproduced orally with &#233;lan. Sabir Khan's opening notes in raag Charukesi was like the flow of a rivulet, smooth, at times rippling before culminating in the big sea called tabla. Zakir Hussain who kept in step with this flow, burst into his brilliant rendition taking the audience on a cyclic trip from vilambit to drut till he reached the crescendo. It was like accurate artistic arithmetic with the creative strokes that are just stunning. He recreated old compositions of taal and rhythm like the pace of a horse from trot to gallop, the tempo of motor and pedestrian sounds (rela) in a maddening traffic with the &#8216;gati' (pace) of an elephant thrown in! That really had the audience in a thrall.The maestro launched into the origin of drum and gave a beautiful demo of Lord Shiva's damruk followed by the conch blowing by the Lord's disciples. An imaginary dialogue between a &#8216;ruti' (mock anger) Radha and an apologetic Krishna with the tabla &#8216;bhol' lent an air of merriment even as his master strokes garnered applause and appreciation. The cascading sound of canon fire, the run of the shocked deer as it hears the hunter's arrow were displayed with skilled perfection. The tabla seemed to reverberate with life and breath just by a single gentle touch of his. There was not a trace of strain on his face or hands even as he delivered vibrant beats with effortless ease.Between the two string instrumentalists, it is difficult to conclude who excelled whom. Niladri Kumar's sitar spoke eloquent the &#8216;Bhagyashree' raag ambling through all its nuances. Zakir was determined to play it low key so that the audience savoured the waft of music emanating out of the sitar strings. Kumar was clarity personified as he touched the lowest and the highest range with equal speed and skill. Sabir proved a competent match to the sitarist, in breathing life into the sarangi, which sounded like a bird singing sweet, soulful notes in flawless sync. The rugged, folk instrument transformed into a divine tool in his nimble hands which produced the most ethereal music that one could ever imagine. It was Sabir, the superb all the way!A few popular melodic Hindustani numbers later, the concert wound up with &#8216; Raghupati Raghava Rajaram&#8230;' in Kaapi , an apt ending to an elite audience. Tata Docomo treated Hyderabadis to a memorable evening.
