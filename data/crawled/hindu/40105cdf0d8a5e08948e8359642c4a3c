V&#8220;This festival is dedicated to three great maestros,  Pandit Bade Ramdas (vocal), Ustad Bismillah Khan (shehnai) and  Pandit Sundar Lal (dance) as the disciplines they practised comprise the whole of music,&#8221; said Ranjana Srivastava, Dean and senior Kathak dancer of  Lucknow gharana. He also described the contributions of Pt. Sundar Lal.On the podium of the University&#8217;s Pandit Omkarnath Thakur hall, four young talents enthralled listeners. Their performances raised hopes for their future.First was Supriya Shah who sung raga Hemant on her sitar, with a fresh mould and with dignified energy. This  raga was created by Ustad Allauddin Khan saheb and Supriya  sung here skilfully using its prominent notes, Risabh (Re) and Pancham (Pa).After Supriya, vocalist Sharda Velankar  sang the notes of an old raga Sarasvati combining it with raga Vachaspati using Komal Nisad (Ni) and Tivra Madhyam clearly.Rajesh Shah took the stage after her to open his recital on the sitar with Raga Hameer.The listeners of Benaras came across this raga played on the sitar after a long time. Pundalik Krisna Bhagwat accompanied him on the tabla.Rajesh chose this raga at the appropriate time, which is in the evening, as the festival began in the morning with other performances.Finally, a Kathak dance deservingly concluded the  festival. Vidhi Nagar, from Lucknow, by staying in Varansai,  gracefully performed all the musical nuances of her gharana.Vidhi maintained the balance between pure dance (Nritta) and emotion (Nritya) in a dignified manner.It proved that an artiste from a music institution can also make a space of  their own.She is a disciple of Pornima Pandey (ex Vice Chancellor of Bhatkhande Sangeet Vishwavidyalaya) and late Subhas Dixit (disciple of Pt. Birju Maharaj).From Shiva stuti to bhava nritya , she displayed  a controlled energy, which grew steadily.Her hand and foot movement were impeccable, as were her hand and face gestures.The Festival began with words on Bismillah Khan by noted musicologist  Lipika Dasgupta.It concludedwith a Ramdhun, a favourite of Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya,the founder of Benaras Hindu University.
