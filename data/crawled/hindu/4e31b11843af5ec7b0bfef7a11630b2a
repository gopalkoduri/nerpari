VIn the present era of music which is shored up heavily by technicalities and inventions, it is no surprise that Anil Srinivasan and Sikkil Gurucharan came up with their new album &#8216;Blue Divine&#8217;, fourth in the series of their piano-vocal combine.Unlike many other fusion efforts, here melody and harmony have been given due prominence and integrated minus confusion.The western instrument that finds extensive use in solo, ensemble and chamber music as well an accompaniment, has been thoughtfully positioned to compliment the Carnatic vocal presentation of Gurucharan.Truly, it was a different ball game. With the azure sky behind the tree as an imposing backdrop, the stage was set with the piano and two seats for the vocalist Gurucharan and percussionist B.S. Purushotham on kanjira at the Ballroom of Taj Connemara.The programme marked the release of the album &#8216;Blue Divine&#8217; and the duo&#8217;s performance was in aid of the Cancer Research and Relief Trust (CRRT).There is no gainsaying about the piano&#8217;s versatility.  Anil Srinivas&#8217; efforts in association with Gurucharan reiterated this fact.Anil&#8217;s nimble fingers danced on the keyboards,  creating notes of soft, subtle, strong and vibrant tenor.The presentation  carried a unique quality that each of the artistes stood alone on his merit and also created a sense of freshness in unison.The deliberations demonstrated the spontaneity of classic nature. As mentioned in his introduction by Karthik, the fusion is a gorgeous marriage of Western music with the Carnatic tradition.The harmonious notes of the piano melded beautifully  with the supple voice of Gurucharan. The  soft padding here and there by Purushotham added zest to the proceedings. Six numbers from their various albums were on their repertoire.  &#8216;Kannan varugindra neram&#8217;, a kavadi chindu by Oothukadu Venkatakavi, was the first item.&#8216;Aasai mukham marandu&#8217; of Subramania Bharati in Jhonpuri treated the listeners to the many facets of the raga&#8217;s melody, juxtaposed with the fluid notes from Anil. Lalit-Basant Bahar-Vasantha blend was adopted for the Jayadeva Ashtapadi &#8216;Lalitha lavanga lata parisheela&#8217;. Charan added a colourful string of swaras in Vasantha for this number.The soul touching Meera Bhajan &#8216;Hari tumaharo&#8217; in Darbari Kanada drew special attention of the audience because of its intense piety. Madhuvanti filled the air in all its fragrance and sweetness through Sadasiva Brahmendrar&#8217;s &#8216;Sarvam brahmamayam.&#8217;The finale was a soporific lullaby &#8216;Omana thingal&#8217; in Malayalam. The experience one got while listening this particular fusion was different; when one kept enjoying the soothing notes from the piano by Srinivas, the melodious voice of Gurucharan breezed in as a pleasant surprise. It got adorned further with the unobtrusive restrained beats of the kanjira.  The blending was seamless,  the artistes complementing one another without bias eschewing dominance or superiority. The piano and its amazing range of musical cadence proved that it could fit into any form of music.
