VM. RAMESHIt was a special concert, organised by Pazhan Thiru Kovilgal Thiruppani Sangam, society formed to maintain and serve ancient temples and vocalist Papanasam Ashok Ramani seemed comfortable. The special theme mandated him to sing only Tamil songs composed between the 6th and the 18th centuries.The concert was refreshingly different because its very theme  brought to the fore compositions of ancient saint-poets such as Muthu Thandavar and Arunachala Kavi, apart from those of the famous trio &#151;  Appar, Sundarar and Sambandar.Although the central piece was the popular "Thiruvadi Charanam" in Khambodi, the highlights of the evening were the two brilliant numbers &#151;  one in the rare Mandhari (a Panthuvarali derivative) and the other in the not-so-frequently-sung Gowri Manohari.Stealing the showThe Mandhari alapana was followed by Muthu Thandavar's "Chidambarame Ninay" and both the raga and the song made for pleasant listening.But it was Gowri Manohari that stole the show. Ashok Ramani's viruttam ("Kallenum Ayya") in the raga opened with a suggestion of Kharaharapriya, but perhaps realising this, the vocalist brought in the differentiating upper nishadam in the very next line, indicating that it was not Kharaharapriya. A few seconds later, Gowri Manohari came out well defined and it left one wanting more.Another Muthu Thandavar's composition followed. In the end it was a brilliant Gowri Manohari, raising expectations that the lovely raga would once again find favour in concert halls.The concert also featured pieces from Thevaram, Thiruvachagam and Divya Prabhandam. The Khambodi alapana was enjoyable, but the advanced hour caused the vocalist to rush through the neraval and swaras, which was a bit of a let down. Violinist V. V. Ravi and mridangist K. V. Prasad offered commendable support.Bottom Template Starts
