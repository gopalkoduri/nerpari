VSri Bhuvaneswari Temple in a residential colony of K.K. Nagar, Chennai, is celebrating Navaratri on a grand scale and this includes a series of Carnatic music concerts. The temple boasts a fairly big hall for hosting music programmes.Beautifully decorated as Vadivudai Amman, the deity glittered in silk and golden finery. The petite statue of Devi seated on a swing was equally bewitching. Thus began the concert of T.V. Sankaranarayanan in perfect ambience.The stately Nattai and &#8216;Prana Dosmi Devam Vinayakam' brought more listeners to the chairs to hear TVS's engaging music of vitality. Balancing the majesty of Nattai was breezy Kanada with subtlety; Swathi Tirunal's number &#8216;Mamavasatha Janani' and the swaras added here and the previous had the TVS stamp. &#8216;Smara Janaka Subha Sarita' in Behag by the same composer came as another interesting interface.Moving alapanaThe enchanting Mohana Kalyani made its entry with the grace of Mohanam and the charisma of Kalyani. The alapana was moving as delineated by the expert musician. The song was Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar's &#8216;Bhuvaneswariya' with a final touch of converging swaras on &#8216;dhaivatam' with intricate combinations which is TVS's forte. Later, TVS chosen Natakapriya for elaboration. No complaints about TVS's ability to traverse the passages of this rare raga with rarer phrases. But somehow the impact was lukewarm. &#8216;Geetha Vadya Natana Natakapriye' was the kriti (Thanjavur Sankara Iyer) adding a niraval at &#8216;Markoti Sundarangi.' TVS was accompanied by Kovai S. Chandran on the violin, Mannargudi N. Subramanian on the mridangam and Nergunam Sankar on the ganjira with great ardour matching the expertise of the musician.One word about acoustics. Concerts in temples have become common in the city with infrastructure taking a backseat. With better equipment, the concerts could be more enjoyable &#8211; an aspect organisers should seriously consider.
