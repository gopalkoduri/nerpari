VBhramara Trust of Y.T. and\u000aMadhuri Thathachari, Mysore,\u000apresented Ananya's Bharathanatya\u000aaccompanied by\u000aBrunda (nattuvanga), Rajeshwari\u000aPandit (vocal), Narayana (violin)\u000aand Chandrashekhar (mridanga).The occasion was in fact a memorable\u000aevent, a rare confluence of science\u000aand culture. Scholars of high\u000aacumen, and of international stature,\u000agathered to witness the presentation\u000aof Lifetime Achievement\u000aAward bestowed on Dr. K. Kasturirangan\u000a(Former Chairman ISRO).\u000aEminent scientists, Dr. Alok Banerjee,\u000aT.N. Guru Row and R. Shankar\u000areceived Prof Y.T. Thathachari\u000aPrestigious Research Award for Science.The spectators welcomed Ananya's\u000aperformance with warm adulations.\u000aThe little artiste's\u000ainvolvement and composure commanded\u000aunequivocal approval. She\u000awas able to create a sprightly atmosphere\u000afrom her very first presentation,\u000aset to Mallari (Gambhiranata),\u000aand maintained the warmth\u000athroughout her program, with verve\u000aand drive."Shringapuradeeshwari Sharade"\u000a(Kalyani-Padmacharan) comprised\u000apassages highlighting the spiritual\u000aaspects interspersed with relevant\u000aattractive postures. The mudras\u000aconformed to the required acuteness\u000aand clarity. She executed\u000atheermanas precisely with remarkable\u000aagility and reflexes, irrespective\u000aof the speed. "Shivasthuthi" in\u000aCharukeshi too had interesting features.Nevertheless, in general, the\u000astances appeared more exaggerated,\u000aand the hand gestures in many\u000aareas were displaced from their expected\u000apositions in relation to\u000avakshas. In the above context, a reference\u000ato Abhinavaguptha's Bhashya\u000a- thatra chathurashryamulam\u000anruththo angasyajivithamithi\u000a(characteristic features of Chaturashrya\u000anritha hastha is one of the\u000avital guidelines in Nritha activities),\u000abears relevance.Further, in a few instances very\u000aintricate movements in drutha\u000agathis gave an impression as if they\u000awere squeezed into the passages, restricting\u000asmooth and graceful flow\u000aof vinyasas.Swarasankula Sangeetha Sabha\u000aorganised music concerts in memory\u000aof the legendary visionary, Ganayogi\u000aPanchakshari Gawai. The\u000aSabha bestowed the title, Swara Tapaswi\u000aon Ganapati Bhat Hasanagi.In Ravishankar Mishra's inaugural\u000aflute concert, one could sense\u000adeep-rooted genuine submission,\u000aalluring simplicity and hypnotic involvement:\u000acarefully polished competence\u000ainstantly carrying the\u000alisteners into a deep state of repose.In Marva, he explored the swaras\u000aslowly, giving sufficient time for\u000athem to emerge with purity and\u000asubtlety. This in turn facilitated the\u000alisteners to grasp and assimilate the\u000aessences of both the raga and its\u000amoods, of varied dimensions in relation\u000ato different sapthaks in the\u000aprocess of evolvement.He invariably complemented\u000ahigher swaras with the lower ones\u000aand vice-versa, so that the lulling\u000aambience was not disturbed even to\u000athe slightest degree, at any stage of\u000athe badath. Bhimashankar Bidanur's\u000arole (tabla) in preserving the\u000asubliminal quality, understanding\u000athe flautist's artistic predisposition\u000awas immense. He did not resort to\u000aunnecessary tricky layakaris: judicious\u000aemployment of tekas alone\u000awas sufficient to elevate the concert\u000ato great heights.The concert reminded Alfred\u000aTennyson's lines from "The Lotus\u000aEaters": "There is sweet music here\u000athat softer falls, than petals from\u000ablown roses on the grass, or nightdews\u000aon still waters between walls\u000aof shadowy granite, in a gleaming\u000apass; music that gentler on the spirit\u000alies".Other inclusions were Hamsadhwani\u000aand Mishra Shivaranjani.
