VP.V. Parameswaran can definitely be proud of his vocal prowess; his voice is his fortune, but his style is not. At the 43 {+r} {+d} year of Tyagaraja Aradhana and Sri Rama Navami Music Festival of Asthika Samajam, Venus Colony, Alwarpet, he had the opportunity to validate his musical skills and he made use of it, though partially.There is a vast difference between class room singing and concert presentation. The practice session in a class room may move at a slow pace so that the students realise and understand the nuances of the kriti and raga in a better way; while in a concert the tempo needs to be varying depending on the nature of the compositions.Parameswaran started off his concert with &#8216;Raghunayaka' in Hamsadhwani rather lethargically and even his second speed swaras were hardly brisk or inspiring. A well known fast number such as &#8216;Dharini Telusukonti' in Suddha Saveri moved at snail's pace. A concert cannot afford to have such a sedentary start by any stretch of imagination or novelty.Heavy-light touchA cautious raga exposition of Subhapantuvarali followed. Parameswaran's raga alapanas, kriti rendition and swarakalpana all carried a heavy light touch! Oxymoron? Yes. His phrases were simply peripheral without efforts to feel the core in many places; inclusion of false voice in upper regions enhanced the insubstantial and frothy feel. However, his voice was quite pleasant in the lower register sancharas.On the whole, he sounded more like the hero in a Tamil film trying to present a concert than a classical Carnatic music vidwan on stage.Tyagaraja's &#8216;Ennalu Urage' punctuated with a niraval and swaras on the anupallavi line could not rise above patchiness because of this filmi and fragile treatment.On swara rounds, Parameswaran scored slightly better and tried to include his creativity to make best permutations. But, here too, as he progressed he invariably fell into syllables of tedious lengths.Comparatively, the main raga Khambodi was better conceptualised and projected for Tyagaraja's &#8216;O Rangasayee.' &#8216;Bhooloka Vaikuntam' was taken up for niraval and swaras. Here the niraval also was better loaded up. &#8216;Seethamma Mayamma' in Vasantha and &#8216;Nenarunchara Napai Nee' in Simhavahini (both by Tyagaraja) were other inclusions in the concert.The accompanying artists naturally reflect the mood and style of the main artist. M.A. Sundareswaran cannot be faulted for trite and light replies of Subhapantuvarali and Khambodi as the main artist's expressions were just superficial. Vellore Ramabhadran maintained his poise without much excitement.
