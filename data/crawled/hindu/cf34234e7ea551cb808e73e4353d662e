VB. RAMADEVISriram Gangadharan gratified the audience with his energetic music at Nani Palkhiwala Auditorium, Coimbatore, under the aegis of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts.It took some time for the hall to fill in and those who came inside were happy that they did so. The influence of GNB was dominant throughout the concert. (Sriram considers himself a &#8216;manasika sishya&#8217; of the legendary GNB). Old timers who have heard the original musical legend relived those days while the youngsters (there were very few) were impressed by the GNB style. However, a few felt that he should soon evolve a style of his own. &#8216;Mahaganapathim Manasaa Smaraami&#8217; in Nattai (Dikshitar) opened a session of vigorous music. He let the audience soak in the spirit of  some of the kritis (&#8216;Varugalaamo Aiyaa&#8217;, Manji, Gopalakrishna Bharati and &#8216;Arivaar Yaar Unnai&#8217;, Mukhari, Arunachalakkavirayar). But it was his artistry that was projected most of the time. &#8216;Nandagopala Krishnam&#8217; in Panthuvarali by Narayana Tirtha  and &#8216;Brochevarevarura&#8217; in Khamas by Mysore Vasudevachar were magnificent.The vocalist took up Andholika (&#8216;Sevikka Vendum Aiyaa,&#8217; Muthu Thandavar) and Shrutiranjani (&#8216;Edhari Sancharinthura,&#8217; Tyagaraja) for elaboration, which is unusual, but made a wonderful job of it. He was at his best in Thodi and &#8216;Thaamathamen Swaami&#8217; (Papanasam Sivan) that followed was highly enjoyable.The colourful niraval (especially &#8216;Siva Narayana Tirtha,&#8217; Panthuvarali), the speedy torrents of swaras and the briga-filled alapanas were evidence of Sriram&#8217;s hard work and dedication. He had taken care to present a rich fare by including the popular kritis of a number of great composers, old and new. The quintessential GNB song, &#8216;Radha Sametha Krishna&#8217; concluded the concert. H.N.Bhaskar&#8217;s violin was  supportive and subdued, enlivening the outpouring of the vocalist. When his turn came, he delved deep into the ragas and showered equally scintillating swaras. Mridangam by N. Ramakrishnan was full of youthful joy while E.M.Subramaniam&#8217;s ghatam showed the result of talent coupled with rich experience. The concert seemed to instil vigour into the audience and there was a satisfied smile on everyone&#8217;s face.Bottom Template Starts
