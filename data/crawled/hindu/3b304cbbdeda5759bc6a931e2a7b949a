VB. RAMADEVIThe Telugu Samithi and Modern Scientific Company, Coimbatore, paid a musical tribute to the late Maharajapuram Santhanam by arranging the vocal concert of Maharajapuram Srinivasan, son and disciple of the late legend at Pravachana mandapam, Kodandaramar Koil, Coimbatore.Srinivasan, with his rich voice, reminded the audience of his illustrious father  in the selection of songs and the bhani.MelodiousThe first number, a varnam by Lalgudi Jayaraman in Charukesi opened the gates for a sumptuous feast of melody. `Ramuni Maravakave' in Panthuvarali by Papanasam Sivan was steeped in emotion, particularly during the neraval for the lines `Rama rama eni.' He sang `Rama Rama' in different ways, each more appealing than the other. Srinivasan presented `Ezhilmigu Hamsanadham,' a lovely composition that brought out the characteristics of the raga Hamsanadham.`Nannu Vidachi Kadalakura' by Tyagaraja in Reethigowla, produced the unfailing effect of total devotion. `Himadrisuthe Paahimaam' in Kalyani by Syama Sastri was regal while the Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi in Karaharapriya with the words, `Rama Nee Samaanamevaru,' was wholesome with a leisurely alapana, satisfying neraval and sprightly swaraprastharas.`Abhaya Varadhe Sharadhe' was endearing with the exquisitely graceful way in which the pallavi was started. Srinivasan also sang quite a few popular songs on request such as `Neeraja Dhala Nayana,' `Thedi Vandhennudan Aadi Magizhgiraan,' `Vilaiyaada Idhu Neramaa,'  `Govinda Ninna Naamave Chendha,' `Srichakraraja Simhasaneshwari' and concluded with a spirited naamavali `Namah Paarvatipathaye' following it with the inevitable all-time favourite `Bho Shambho.' Nagai Sriram (violin) showed exceptional dexterity and won frequent appreciation from the vocalist as well as the audience. Thanjavur Kumar  (mridangam) proved that he had a class of his own. Ganesh Srinivasan accompanied his father effectively, emerging as the fourth generation singer from the same family.Bottom Template Starts
