VThe Nadhadweepam Trust and Sangeetha Gurukulam jointly celebrated the 98th birth anniversary of Sangeetha Pithamaha  Semmangudi R. Srinivasa Iyer at the Sri Sringeri Sankara Math, Srirangam, recently. Maharajapuram S. Srinivasan rendered a vocal concert on the occasion.Srinivasan commenced the programme with the Sunadha Vinodhini raga varnam, followed by `Ramunimaravakave' of Tyagaraja  and  ``Ikanaina" in the raga Pushpalathika. The rendition of `Dinamanivamsa' and `Ksheenamai' in Mukari took the audience on a nostalgic trip.The composition of Indra Natesan, "Abayavaradhe Saradhe" in Hindolam was very soft. The main piece with the alapana and swara prastharas in the Kalyani kriti, "Nijadasavaradha" of Patnam Subramania Iyer established the school of Maharajapuram.The Ragamalika in 18 ragas of Kadalur Subramanyam, `Thaye Yesodha' and `Bho Shambo' made one remember  Maharajapuram Santhanam. He concluded the concert with the Sivaranjani raga tillana and "Vilayada Idhu Nerama."The vocal support by Ganesh Viswanathan, son of Srinivasan and the accompaniment by Nagari R. Muralidharan (violin), Srimushnam, V. Rajarao (mridangam) and Srirangam Kannan (morsing) adequately enriched the concert.Tiruchi K. Ramesh, Managing Trustee, Nadhadweepam Trust, proposed a vote of thanks.M. BALAGANESSINBottom Template Starts
