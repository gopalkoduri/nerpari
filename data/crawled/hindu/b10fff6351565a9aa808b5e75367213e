VIn the recent past, the mizhavu Thayambaka has gained popularity among  connoisseurs. Recently, mizhavu artiste Kalamandalam Ratheesh Bhas enthralled the audience with his maiden Thayambaka performance at Nepathya, Moozhikulam.Ratheesh Bhas, a native of Edappal, first learned to play the thimila and became a Panchavadayam artiste. But  Ratheesh found his muse when he  happened to  hear the mizhavu maestro Kalamandalam Eswaranunni&#8217;s heart-throbbing beats on the mizhavu.Soon Ratheesh joined Kerala Kalamandalam to learn to play the mizhavu. He underwent rigorous training under Kalamandalm Eswaranunni and Kalamandalam Achuthanandan for eight years and took a diploma and then a degree (Bachelor of Performing Arts) in mizhavu. For the past four years he has been working as the mizhavu artiste at Nepathya.The mizhavu Thayambaka was on the same pattern as that of a chenda  Thayambaka.  The drumming in four tempos was in four talas &#8211; Chembada, Atanthakoor, Edakalam and Erikidi. The accelerating beats of the artiste  led the listeners to the crescendo.Ratheesh Bhas proved his virtuosity over the instrument right from the slow tempo and never once did his concentration flag.  While playing different permutations and combinations on the mizhavu, the talented drummer mesmerised the audience with his  creativity and skill.Ratheesh  said that he had been  preparing for his maiden Thayambaka performance for the past six months under the guidance of chenda player Dinesh Warrier.Ratheesh was supported  by Kalamandalam Anoop and Kalamandalam Vineesh on the mizhavu, Dinesh Warrier on the chenda and Balamurali on the elathalam.
