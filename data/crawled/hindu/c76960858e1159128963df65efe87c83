VIt was touted as a musical event with a confluence of great performers and lived up to the hype. With four stalwarts &#151;  Rajan and Sajan Mishra, Kadri Gopalnath and Ronu Majumdar, and teenage prodigy Rimpa Siva &#151;  it was a musical treat. Premaanjali Educational Trust, which organised the event, seemed to have learnt from their earlier mistakes with the result that the acoustics were fairly well taken care of. Commencing the programme were Rajan and Sajan Mishra, whose reputation is richly deserved as this evening proved it once again. The brothers began with a Shree raga piece in jhaptaal and ektaal. This bhakti-rasa steeped lyric on Lord Narayan proceeded in a languorous style and later picked up tempo. Raag Sohini followed next &#151;  the profusion of high-pitched notes explained by the fact that the raga dwells mostly in the upper register. Considering the time of the year, the choice of a song celebrating Basantha Rithu was appropriate. Rajan and Sajan displayed the immaculate coordination and mutual understanding, a celebrated characteristic of their performances. They concluded with Guru Nanak's well-known bhajan "Jagath Mein Jhooti Dekhi Preet". Fine support was provided by Ravindra Yavgal on the tabla, and Vyasamurthy Katti on the harmonium.Jugalbandis always arouse excitement, especially when the combination is of two instruments and of expert players.  Both Ronu's flute and Kadri's saxophone lived up to expectations. Kadri began with a brief alapana in Hamsadhwani, and  was followed predictably by "Vatapi Ganapathim". The raga, given its popularity in both Hindustani and Carnatic music, was an apt choice for a jugalbandi. Ronu began the next piece, which was in the Hindustani Chandrakauns, a pentatonic or audava raga and a night melody. The popular "Vaishnava Janatho" bhajan was chosen to round off the performance.Pakhavaj artiste Durga Prasad Majumdar, Harikumar on mridanga and G. Rajashekhar on morsing played their roles competently. The tani avarthanam was interesting though brief, but then there were so many performances crowded into this one evening.Rimpa Siva, the tabla prodigy came on next. Her seemingly effortless and joyous playing &#151;  the mark of an accomplished artiste &#151;  was as much a treat to watch as to listen. Unfortunately, the audience had dwindled by then. Prathyush Mishra's harmonium provided fine accompaniment to Rimpa's tabla.ARUNA CHANDARAJUBottom Template Starts
