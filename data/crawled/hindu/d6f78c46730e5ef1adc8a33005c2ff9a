VWhen this technique was applied to the rendering of Tyagaraja kirtanas, the kutcheri could not but be wholesome.The quality was evident even in the first item, &#8216;Merusamana&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla). Gayatri Girish imparted both delicacy in the articulation of the sahitya and depth in bringing out the structure of the kirtana. The effort revealed the subtle inter-relationship between the raga and the song.This item in particular and later the Mukhari alapana and song, &#8216;Entaninne Varnintunu&#8217; as rendering by her, stressed the special tone, flavour and direction that the saint had implanted in them.It was in the Mukhari vinyasa that a listener could sense the benefit that her guru had conferred on her namely the special experience of coming to grips with the enchanting shades of the raga. Consistency and evenness of her voice were at its best to proclaim as it were that Mukhari had to be felt and not thought out. Earlier, she rendered the Varali pancharatnam, &#8216;Kana Kana Ruchira&#8217; with restraint and relish.The clear stream of Carnatic music was spread all over in the alapana of Sankarabharanam (&#8216;Eduta Nilichite&#8217;), the main item in the performance. Here technical competence was well linked to aesthetic expression. Covering the length and breadth of the raga, the main strides were in the tara stayi presenting supple contours. The sancharas were neatly chiselled without much of creative excitement.In the interpretation of the song she laid emphasis on innate artistic process which was carried to the niraval part too.In between these two kirtanas, &#8216;Entaninne&#8217; and &#8216;Edutanilichite,&#8217; she placed Ramapriya alapana and song, &#8216;Sandehamunu &#8211; Theerpavayya&#8217;. She also rendered a rarely heard song, &#8216;Eraamuni&#8217; in Vakulabharanam.V. Sanjeev, the violinist, was adept in his solo in handling variations of emphasis on the nuances of Mukhari and Sankarabharanam. The shared experience between him and the vocalist marked the quality of the concert. A vein of musical fervour permeated the raga pictures he painted. Good manodharma played a central contributive role in his solo versions.Trivandrum Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and B. Sundar Kumar (kanjira) lent percussive support, lively, energetic and passionate.
