VIn All India Radio&#8217;s National Programme of Music of December 6, Shyamoli Biswas gave a brilliant sitar recital. Her reposeful alap-jod and gat-todas in  raga Jhinjhoti had  delightful melodic sequences besides her neat and tuneful meanderings over the strings and the frets. Her presentation of this colourful melody revealed her good understanding of the raga. Her next rendering in the programme in raga Gorakh Kalyan further revealed her good artistic insight and polished technical abilities.Geeta Mukherji&#8217;s rendering of a thumri in raga Mishra Tilak Kamod in the Sunday Night Concert of December 7 delighted listeners too for her singing with a highly sonorous vocal refrain and well cultivated musicianship. Her next rendering of a dadra in raga Gara was rendered with many a liltingly deployed variation.AIR presented senior female vocalist Malavika Kanan on December 9. She charmingly rendered a thumri in the raga Mishra Tilang, revealing her richly endowed musicianship besides her well cultivated artistic approach to classical music.Also, Anupama Mahajan charmed listeners with a sitar recital in raga Bageshwari with  neat and tunefully executed alap-jod followed by  liltingly rendered compositions. It was nice to observe her having developed a distinct individualistic style of her own. One, however, wished she had refrained from concluding her recital of the evening with a dhun in the early morning raga Bhairavi.Recently, Akashvani Shimla aired a charming recital by Lakshmi Shankar. Listening to her  thumri in raga Mishra Khamaj was indeed a delight to the ears. Although she is a Tamil by birth, her marriage to Pandit Ravi Shankar&#8217;s elder brother, the late Rajendra Shankar, helped her to foray into Hindustani semi-classical music &#8212; earlier under the guidance of her sitarist brother-in-law, and later from the late Ustad Rehman Khan of  Patiala gharana.Yet another impressive broadcast by AIR was Sarfaraz Hussain Khan&#8217;s rendering of khayals in the ragas Mian Ki Todi and Gaud Sarang, which were distinguished for their purity and artistic handling, with quite a good number of highly intricate phrasings.While the former was the son and disciple of the late Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan, the doyen of the Rampur-Saheswan gharana, the latter was the son and disciple of the late Ustad Vilayat Hussain Khan, the legendary maestro of the Agra-Atrauli gharana. Also, one must mention yet another presentation &#8212; khayals presented in the rarely heard raga Samant Sarang by Yunus Hussain Khan. It fell soothingly on the ears. Ajay Pohankar too delighted with his tuneful rendering of khayals in the early morning raga Bairagi-Bhairav. It was amusing though, to hear the announcer mention this particular item as &#8216;sugam sangeet&#8217; (light classical music).The late Ustad Sarfaraz Hussain Khan and the late Ustad Yunus Hussain Khan belong respectively to the Rampur-Saheswan and the Agra-Atrauli gharanas.The sarangi recital by Ghulam Sabri impressed too with his tuneful rendering in the intricately permutated raga Salag-Varali. Furthermore, the  &#8220;Chayan&#8221; of December 9 was a delight to the ears for the late vichitra veena maestro Pandit Gopal Krishen&#8217;s alap-jod-jhala and compositions in the raga Durbari-Kanada rendered with utmost reposefulness and with a highly scholastic insight into the melody&#8217;s regal format. The mid-tempo Jhap tala of 10 beats followed by the 16-beat time cycle of Teen tala were redolent with quite a few lively variations.Also, young Wasif Fayazuddin Dagar was at his usual best with alap-jod followed with a well composed dhamar in the 14-beat intricate time cycle of Dhamar tala (5+2+3+4) with Mohan Shyam Sharma&#8217;s adroit pakhawaj accompaniment.The late Sunil Kumar Bose&#8217;s tuneful and liltingly sung thumri-dadra in raga Mishra Kafi was thrilling too. Bose retired from Akashvani as one of its senior station directors but continued as a teacher and a professional singer of semi-classical music. Yet another presentation, qawwalis by Aziz Mohammed Qutubuddin and party, was delightful for their singing with gusto, tunefulness and good devotional fervour.One notes that quite a few recordings are being frequently repeated by Akashvani. The late Pandit Maniram&#8217;s khayals in raga Bhupali is very often heard in the Tuesday night &#8220;Chayan&#8221; programmes. Roop Kulkarni&#8217;s flute recital in raga Brindavan Sarang was broadcast on November 29 and again on December 4.
