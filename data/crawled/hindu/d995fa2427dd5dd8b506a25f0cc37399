VEvery  performer was given a theme,  such as &#8220;Krishna Nee Begane Baro&#8221;, &#8220;Om Shivaya Namaha&#8221;, &#8220;Om Namo Narayana&#8221; and &#8220;Shakti Prabhavam&#8221;.Though these were full-fledged concerts, the songs that they presented were based on these themes. Often, such thematic concerts curtail the full potential of the artistes, as they tinker with their repertoire to fit it into the thematic format.However, T.M. Krishna, who performed on the last day, did not allow his musical talents to be eclipsed by the format.Krishna&#8217;s  concert  on &#8220;Shakti Prabhavam&#8221;  comprised compositions in praise of the Goddess.sDikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Hiran Mayeem&#8221; in the raga Lalita that Krishna presented in a slow tempo was emotive.Earlier, he presented a detailed and fine sketch of the  raga.The hallmarks of Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s fast-tempo &#8220;Kanidharulpuri&#8221; in the raga Kalyani were the creative neraval of a phrase from the charanam of the composition and brilliant swara improvisations. While presenting Swati Tirunal&#8217;s &#8220;Janani Mammava&#8221;, in the raga Bhairavi, Krishna followed the tradition in vogue during the Navaratri concerts at the Navarathri Mandapam at the Swati Tirunal palace in Thiruvananthapuram.Soon after presenting a fine sketch of the raga, Krishna presented taanam to the accompaniment of mridangam, as done there.After the taanam, artistes present Navaratri kritis composed by Swati Tirunal, instead of a pallavi. Krishna too did so and handled this composition well.He spruced  it up with neraval of a phrase and rich swaraprastaras.Shlokas in the form of vrittams that he presented subsequently in the ragas Ananda Bhairavi, Varali, Sama, Poorvi Kalyani, Mayamalavagowla, Yedukula Kamboji, Kapi and Begada were scintillating.R.K. Sriramkumar on the violin and J. Vaidyanathan on the mridangam provided understanding and excellent support to Krishna, enhancing  concert.Synergy  between the artistes drove the concert to its successful outcome.T.M. Krishna, who gave his first concert as a child of 12, has learnt under some of the finest stalwarts of Carnatic music. He started learning music at the age of six from Bhagavatulu Seetharama Sharma. He also underwent special ragam-taanam-pallavi training from Chengalpet Ranganthan and advanced training from the late doyen Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer.
