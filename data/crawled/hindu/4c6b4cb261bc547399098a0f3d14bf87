VTheir intuition-driven concert was an amalgam of vocal, western violin and traditional Carnatic music giving an impression of symphony.The Pancharagamalika varnam with which the siblings started the recital was followed by &#8216;Vallabha Nayakasya&#8217; in Begada garnished with  swaras. Kalyani by Kumaresh and Bhairavi by Ganesh were the ragas chosen for elaboration  and though they had shades of Carnatic melody here and there, western harmony dominated.Their ragapravaham in Hindolam was rendered with ferocity with the percussionists joining the fray sounding like drums. &#8216;Raghuvamsasudha&#8217; (Kadhana Kuthuhalam), &#8216;Kamalambika&#8217; (Punnagavarali), &#8216;Thallininnu&#8217; (Kalyani) and &#8216;Entavedukondu&#8217; provided solid kirtana fare.The crescendo and descent notes and scale in Nattai for RTP were over-demonstrative. All the flash and fizz of a philharmonic session was there sans serenity.Satheesh Kumar (mridangam) and Guruprasad (ghatam) extended frenetic percussion support.
