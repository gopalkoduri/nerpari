VThe 10-day Sangeeta Nritta Festival, organised as part of the Sivarathri celebrations at Sree Vadakkunnathan Temple, Thrissur, included  three music concerts. Mandolin  U. Srinivas, Bombay Jayashree and Sarath were the three singers.Srinivas   introduced each raga with its attendant details before the recital. He opened with Adi Ayyapa&#8217;s  Bhairavi Ada tala varnam, &#8216;Viriboni.&#8217;  As he switched over to the popular Dikshitar kirtanam in Natta (Adi tala), &#8216;Mahaganapathim,&#8217; and later to the much sought-after &#8216;Entharo mahanu bhavalu,&#8217; the Tyagaraja pancharatna kirtanam in Sree raga,  his mastery over the instrument was evident to one and all.Often he whizzed  through the entire gamut of strings, which created the effect of an extra accompaniment.  His style of filling the gaps with bewitching phrases of the raga, which was discernible in the elaboration of the alapana of Poorvikalyani, appeared unique. The composition was  Neelakanta Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Ananda natanam&#8217; in Roopaka tala.After the Swati composition &#8216;Mamava sadaajanani&#8217; in Kanada, set to Roopaka tala, Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Etiyochanalu&#8217; in Kiranavali raga presented a contrast for its fast tempo and  tiny groups  of swaras. The major raga for the evening was &#8216;Swara raga sudha,&#8217; a Tyagaraja composition in Sankarabharanam, in Adi tala.While the essaying of the raga was exhaustive, the rubbing noise of the fingers, especially on the bass strings, was a distraction.The avartanam tagged to it by Kuzhalmannam Ramakrishnan (mridangam) and Udupi Sreedhar (ghatom)  was in the right proportion. Sreenivasa Rao was on the violin.A two-hour recital by Bombay Jayshree proved that she is a traditionalist to the core.  All the pieces she choose were in praise of Siva,  the presiding deity of the temple.&#8216;Sambo Mahadeva sankaragiri,&#8217; a Tyagaraja composition in Panthuvarali, provided an inspiring start  to her concert.She scaled the upper sthayis effortlessly in &#8216;Mokshamugalada,&#8217; the popular Tyagaraja composition in Saramathy.  The prolonged alapana of Shanmughapriya was remarkable on account of the myriad shades of the raga she painted.  She choose to sing the neraval at  &#8216;Sarvabhoumane Sankarane.&#8217;&#8216;Pahimam Parvathy,&#8217; the Mohanam number of Dikshitar in Roopaka tala,  was followed by  Shyma Sastri&#8217;s composition in Aahari, &#8216;Mayammayanine pilachite.&#8217;The relatively slow tempo of the number enhanced its melodic appeal.  Jayshree also took up Sankarabharanam for elaboration and the number was the Dikshitar composition &#8216;Sankaracharya bhakatha manovinu,&#8217; in Adi tala. She was accompanied by Embar Kannan (violin), Nanjil Arul (mridangam) and Udupi Sreedhar (ghatom).Sarath presented a  scholarly recital on the last day. The three-hour concert was noteworthy for his erudition. Sarath  sang quite a few of the compositions of his guru, M. Balamuralikrishna.The opening number &#8216;Amba ananda dayaki,&#8217; a Dr. Balamuralikrishna composition in Gambhira Natta, set to Adi tala, was in praise of Sive (Parvathy).It was followed by  Dikshitar&#8217;s  &#8216;Vathapi Ganapathim bhaje&#8217; in Hamsadwani, set to Adi tala.   Another Balamurali composition in Chandrika raga exhibited Sarath&#8217;s ability to effortlessly scale  the higher octaves.A Thirugnana Sambadar Tamil composition in Mohanam was followed by Panthuvarali, which he took up for elaboration. The composition was Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Ninne neranamminanu&#8217; in Roopaka tala.The relatively heavy number was followed by light compositions in Subhashini, Puunagavarali, and Ahir Bhairavi and so on. Mahadeva Sarma&#8217;s violin was remarkable  for the clarity of his bowing.  Jayakrishnan on the mridangam and Kottayam Unnikrishnan on the ghatom lent commendable support to the vocalist.
