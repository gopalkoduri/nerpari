VThe vocal concert of Vidya Subramaniam at the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam was interesting as she provided a brief prologue or epilogue to each kriti she rendered highlighting some special aspects of the content in addition to the information on the composer, ragam and talam.&#8216;Aganitha Mahimadputha Leela,' the Gowla ragam composition from the Saptaratna collection of Oothukadu Venkatakavi in Adi talam was the opening item of her concert. The composition was set in the lines of the Pancharatna kritis with a charanam followed by swara-sahitya suite. Vidya pointed out a few noteworthy aspects of the kriti such as the &#8216;Namo Namasthe,' the refrain after each charanam, and also the famous and favourite reference from the composer about the &#8216;Kalinga Nartana' of Sri Krishna as &#8216;Bhujanga Sirasi Natanam' in this kriti.The second one was a Dikshitar number in ragam (Vadi) Vasanthabhairavi, &#8216;Prasanna Venkateswaram' in Triputa talam which was embellished with a few rounds of swaras. Following this, Vidya took up the raga interpretation of Ritigowla. Her raga essay was imbued with the typical and topical phrases of Ritigowla yet leaving something wanting. Her selection here went in favour of Saint Tyagaraja. &#8216;Nannu Vidachi Gala' and a niraval on &#8216;Baguga Nannelu Kora' with swaras lifted the presentation. The kriti, as mentioned by Vidya, opens with emotional touch and closes with complete surrender with serenity.&#8216;Naayaganaai Nindra,' the Andal Tiruppavai in raga Durbar, was the filler before her launch to expand Kalyani. Vidya's forays into the raga exercise were energetic than aesthetic. It was done more professionally than passionately.Accent on swarasAnnamacharya's number in praise of the goddess of Tirupathi &#8216;Alamelumanga Nee' set to Adi talam was rendered without frills or additions. Kedaragowla, known for its strong melodic and majestic qualities, was chosen for Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi. Offering the raga in two instalments, Vidya gave extra accent on the raga's dominant swaras and phrases. The pallavi that followed the tanam, was &#8216;Sri Venkatesam Smarami Seshachala Nayakam,' in Adi Talam. In an RTP, where the main raga occupies the major role, it is simply superfluous for ragamalika swaras. Even if it is attempted, it should have some relationship or connectivity to the main ragam chosen or a novelty in its approach. Just by adding a few syllables of brisk swaras in assorted ragams hardly add any intellectual or aesthetic worth to the presentation.While Vidya Subramaniam should be credited for her open-throated articulation, she should be reminded that if the articulation is centred more on sound than subtlety then elegance will be a casualty. This was perceptible in all her raga essays. Arunachala Karthik reflected the vocalist's visions of the raga by adding a few touches of grace in his Ritigowla, Kalyani and Kedaragowla versions. Madurai B. Sundar and Trivandrum N. Hariharan on the rhythmic side were just passable.
