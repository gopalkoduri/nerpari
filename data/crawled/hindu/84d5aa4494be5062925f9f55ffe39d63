VIf one has to test the voice and its capacity, try to hold a swara for quite a while without a shake in it.Carnatic music has voice training embedded in it,&#8221;  declared Sumathi Krishnan who spoke on the topic &#8216;Role of Varnam in Voice Training&#8217; at the morning lec-dem session of Parthasarathy Swami Sabha.Sumathi, a research scholar working on her doctorate in music, is a student of R. Vedavalli.  So Sumathi&#8217;s lecture was interesting and informative. In Carnatic music, the varnam figures before the students move to  kriti learning and is considered as a stepping stone.Sangeetha Ratnakaram says &#8216;shaareeram&#8217; is one which refers to a gifted voice without any regular practice. How to attain shareeram? It is through teachers, training, devotion and above all, good fortune. Voice trainers call it as vocal athletics. A good voice should have sweetness, audibility, volume, continuity, flow and stress or azhutham.A good voice can traverse the three octaves or at least two, from mandra panchamam to tara pachamam. &#8220;If one has to test the voice and its capacity, try to hold a swara for quite a period without a shake in it,&#8221; said Sumathi.She explained the importance of voice synchronisation with the sruti, flexibility for gamakas, importance of reproducing the notes (swara suddha) and ability to move on kalapramana or the timing. For this, in western music, the pupil gets trained in vowels in different scales and in Hindustani, it is through taans or akaras.Having explained all the above,  Sumathi spoke about the varnam as a vocal training device. The varnam as the name suggests is a colourful composition as it carries a poorvangam, a sahitya, mukthayi swaras and uthragam again a line of sahitya appended by swaras. These swaras have been composed by the stalwart composers in such a way that it provides ample scope to get one&#8217;s voice trained. Sumathi explained the following aspects with examples by singing in between to demonstrate her point.Besides vocal range, ideal octave ranges are covered in a varnam. The mandra and madyama sthayees and how they are covered in a varnam, were shown by singing varnam passages from Bhairavi Ata tala &#8216;Viriboni&#8217; and &#8216;Sarasijinabha&#8217; in Khambodi.The stress to be given on certain syllables in the rendition was shown through the Todi Ata tala varnam. The next was breath control. Long phrases, Sumathi explained, have to be carefully rendered taking in a breath at the right juncture, as otherwise the phrases would get distorted.She demonstrated this by singing in two kalais (tempos). Voice modulation is another aspect of voice training. Here, Sumathi explained how the effective use of vallinam and mellinam, the strong and soft stress at the right places based on the design structure of swaras. Passages from Nayaki, Hamsadhwani, Kanada and Suruti were presented to drive home this aspect.Range becomes another important feature of voice training. Jumps from one octave to another are common in the mukthayi and ethukadai swaras of a varnam. Sumathi illustrated this with excerpts from Saveri, Anandabhairavi, Khambodi and Mandari varnams of various composers.&#8220;Varja proyogams, which refers to the elimination of a particular swara to add allure to the varnam, had been done in Todi eschewing panchamam and in Kalyani with minimum inclusion of panchamam&#8221;, said Sumathi.Towards the end, Sumathi presented the anubandam to &#8216;Viriboni&#8217; where the janda swara usage was effectively included.Additionally, special features of the gana raga varnam covering Nattai, Gowla, Arabi, Varali and Sri and the tana varnam in Shanmukhapriya where the entire composition had been set on the lines of tanam singing by Mudikondan Venkatarama Iyer set to Tisra Druva talam, were also presented in parts.Sumathi&#8217;s lecture and description kept the audience engaged because of the appealing content and lucid presentation. It was indeed amazing to note that the composers of yesteryears and their profound knowledge in combining science with aesthetics of music like melody, content, rhythm and also their ability to bring the best application of the raga through their varanams.
