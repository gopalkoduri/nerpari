VNada Bharati takes credit for being the first classical music sabha to be invited by Music World to present a programme at its premises  in the Banjara Hills showroom.  Young  vocalist R.V. Panduranga Sarma gave a Carnatic vocal recital at this venue last week in the company of B.S. Narayana on violin, P. Srinivasa Gopalan on mridangam and T.P. Balasubramanyam on ghatam.Sarma's style of rendition is quite leisurely rendering everything clear and musical. He has a bass voice with reasonable range. He recalls the style of his guru D.K. Pattammal  at times. In the process, he picked up good repertoire from her and also her style of rendition. His diction is clear and the presentation of each composition is emotive.Methodical approachHe began with `Mohana varnam' and went for D.K. Pattammal's `Nartanarayani' piece, "Maha Ganapathi Palaya" which set the audience' receptive mood. Rendition of "Kannathandri Napai" in `Devamanohari' was right composition to take up `alapana' of `Kalyani'. Sarma built it carefully in a textbook pattern that needed methodical approach. "Thalli Ninu Nera Namminaanu" in it was neat rendition that was marked by an impressive `swarakalpana'.Sarma then sang another rare piece in `Madhyamavati' and went for Papanasam Sivan's Tamil composition "Avvayyar... ". Sarma chose `Karnataka Devagandhari' as his main melody of the evening. He gave enough time for its structuring, displaying his imagination. He rendered Patnam's "Bhajare Manasa" in this. This was the piece in which the percussionist duo Srinivasa Gopalan and Balasubramanyam displayed their skills in the `tani avartanam'.Sarma ended the show with a `Khamas Tillana' and a Ramadasu `keertana' in `Ananda Bhairavi'. The other notable items were "Guruguhaya Namaste" in `Sama' of Deekshitar and Pattammal's favourite number "Mamava Pattabhirama" in `Manirangu'.There were a couple of Annamacharya compositions too in the repertoire.Violinist Narayanan's version of `Kalyani' was notable for the way he built it into a fine picture in a short a time.GUDIPOODI SRIHARIBottom Template Starts
