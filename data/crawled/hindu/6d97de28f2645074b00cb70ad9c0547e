VWith Arun&#8217;s talent for adapting effortlessly to different genres, his recital was a smorgasbord of classical and devotional forms encompassing varnam, kritis, tillana and slokas, served with panache. The sinuous glides of Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna&#8217;s varnam &#8216;Amma Anadayini&#8217; (Gambhira Nattai) proclaimed the signature style of its composer, the articulation of the line &#8216;Shive Shive&#8217; leaping out at you with vibrancy.In Gopalakrishna Bharati&#8217;s &#8216;Varuvaaro&#8217; (Sama), dramatic pauses turned the spotlight on the word &#8216;Chidambaram&#8217; in the charanam. The Siva Panchakshara Sthotram describing Shiva&#8217;s divine attributes is a paean of exaltation imbued with an intensity that transports the devotee to Kailasa, the Lords&#8217; abode. The perceptive percussive duo comprising J. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and Kiran Kumar (tabla) whose combined effort artfully conjured up the tonal depth of the pakhawaj only added to the experience.Vandanadharini is a raga with strong melodic appeal, many rasikas being familiar with the GNB composition &#8216;Sudha Madhurya Bhashini.&#8217; The alapana reflected the artiste&#8217;s familiarity quotient as glissades and free-flowing sancharas emerged with characteristic exuberance. Only, with most sancharas whirring past, couched in the language of speed, the moment was gone before one could savour a phrase. &#8216;Yaaraadinal&#8217; was sung with interpretative fervour, kalpanaswaras highlighting swarakshara devices such as &#8216;sa da&#8217; and pa da.&#8217;Thanjavur Sankara Iyer&#8217;s &#8217;Mahadeva Shiva Shambho&#8217; (Revathy) touched with its intensity while Guru Surajananda&#8217;s &#8216;Gangadeeswaram&#8217; (Sindhu Bhairavi), Lingashtakam and Lalgudi Jayaraman&#8217;s exquisite tillana in Ragesri sparkled with myriad facets.Kandadevi Vijayaraghavan worked towards being in sync with the vocalist in his raga delineations, while J. Vaidyanathan&#8217;s (mridangam) special rapport with the vocalist was evident in his intuition-driven strokes. Kiran Kumar (tabla) and Kalai Selvam (Thalam) rounded off the efficient team.
