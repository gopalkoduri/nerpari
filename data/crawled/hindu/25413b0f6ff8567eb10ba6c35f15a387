VDr. Ganesh's raga alapana of Kalyanavasantham was excellent. It was rendered with involvement and had the Maharajapuram stamp. Violinist V.V. Ravi's short essay of the ragam was good.Dikshitar's &#8216;Sri Venkatesam Bhajami' (Rupaka talam) was followed with kalpanaswaras at &#8216;Chanka Chakra' (athitha eduppu).This was preceded by Ata tala Kanada varnam &#8216;Neranammi' and Dikshitar's &#8216;Sri Mahaganapathiravatumam' in Gowla. The kalpanaswaras rendered at &#8216;Prakasa' was quite elaborate and good.With all the pakka and upa pakkavadyams the noise level was a bit high, almost drowning the (voice of the) vocalist.Next in the list was Tyagaraja's Sahana piece, &#8216;Urake Galguna' followed by &#8216;Sarame Gani' in Pantuvarali. The short niraval and lengthy kalpanaswaras at &#8216;Samaganaloludai' were excellent with able assistance from the violinist.Elaborate raga essayBefore the main raga Sankarabharanam, Gopalakrishna Bharati's &#8216;Kanakasabapathikku' in Atana was rendered.At this point, one felt that more thought should have been given for song selection to include a fast paced song; also Atana before Sankarabharanam should have been avoided. But, the elaborate delineation of Sankarabharanam was excellent with good voice modulation.The kriti &#8216;Sankaracharyam' with a good number of chowka kala swaras at &#8216;Parama' was rendered well with good support from the percussionists.Quite a lengthy thani followed with Mudhra Bhaskar on the mridangam, Nergunam Sankar on the ganjira and A.S. Krishnan on the morsing giving a wonderful performance.The tail pieces included Maharajapuram Santhanam's &#8216;Vel Vel Viramuruganin Vel' and &#8216;Raghavendra' which was sung with great involvement.
