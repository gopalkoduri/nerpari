VBhubaneswar-based Hindustani vocalist Sagarika Pradhan, who is known for her prowess in the blend of Gwalior, Banaras and Ayodhya gharanas, focussed on compositions on Krishna in her recital for the Guruvayur temple festival.Sagarika began with a Govinda Damodar stuti &#8216;Kararbinde na padarbindam&#8217; in Bhatiyar raga and &#8216;Shree Ganapati Gajanana&#8217;  in Kalyan raga. The Thumri blended in sensual love, eroticism, mysticism and Sufi ideology, and came as a soothing summer shower. &#8216;Man le gayo re sawara,&#8217; composed in raga Marubihag and tal Panjabi, highlighted her  virtuosity in sruti, laya and alapana.Sagarika&#8217;s captivating Hori, a popular Dhrupad sung during the Holi festival,  focussed on the romance of Radha and Krishna. &#8216;Hori khelata hai giridhari&#8217; was composed in Mishrakalyan and the eight-beat tal Dhumali. The &#8216;holi play&#8217; was depicted  as an enchanting dialogue between Harish Chandra Roy on the tabla and Akshaya Kumar Moharana on the violin.In &#8216;Jhula Sakhi&#8217; in ragamalika and tal Kehrwa, the rhythm swayed like a swing (Jhula). As per the request of a listener, she sang  Swami Brahmananda&#8217;s &#8216;Koun gali gaye shyam&#8217; in the style of a Thumri, set to raga Pahadi and tal Deepchandi.The Dadra &#8216;Mori guinya&#8217; revolves around a  devotee&#8217;s imagination of Krishna as her doll. It was set to Misrakamaj and Dadra tal. After rendering the  sloka &#8216;Kasturi tilakam&#8217; (again on the request of a rasika) in Charukesi and tal Dhumali, she  went on to the Oriya bhajan &#8216;Jeevana patra mo&#8217; of Baikuntha Patnaik  in raga Bhairabi and Rupak tal.  Sagarika also rendered &#8216;Ram Govinda hare,&#8217; in raga Kamaj and tal Dhumali.Requests from the audience  forced her &#8220;to cut short a few pre-planned compositions&#8221; and she concluded the recital with &#8216;Hare Krishna,&#8217; which the audience sang with her.  Her explanation of the verses&#8217; meaning and nuances of rags and tals substantially enhanced the level of appreciation of the audience.
