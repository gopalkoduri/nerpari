VShould a concert always start with a varnam or an invocation of Lord Ganesha? Not necessary. Krishna wooed  the audience with the heavy Sankarabharanam kriti &#8216;Enduku Peddala&#8217; of Tyagaraja as the opening item. Of course, there was a swara spell  at &#8216;Veda Sastra&#8217; smartly converging on gandaram. The two  ragas chosen for elaboration were Sriranjani and Kalyani.The pace varied and the raga essays therefore  contained both poignant reposes and aggressive passages.  At times Krishna&#8217;s  dalliance with the  tara sthayi notes sounded forced though he came out  unscathed.Dikshitar&#8217;s less heard but most beauteous &#8216;Sri Dum Durge&#8217; came with electrifying swaras pivoted on &#8216;Karuna Rasa Laya.&#8217; In Kalyani it was Syama Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Talli Ninnu Nera&#8217; with niraval and swaras for &#8216;Syama Krishna Paripalini Soolini.&#8217; There were fillers like &#8216;Vina Rada&#8217; in balanced Devagandhari, &#8216;Anupama Gunampudi&#8217; in spirited Atana and a melting Mukhari with &#8216;Priye Charu Sheele&#8217;.Violinist R.K.Sriram Kumar  executed his role  with professional &#233;lan. Nevertheless, his raga alapana of Sriranjani slightly differed where his response hinged  more on sobriety and continuity.In such concerts invariably rhythm has the upper hand  and the percussionists have a ball. Veterans Guruvayur Durai and T.V.Vasan on mridagam and ghatam respectively set the auditorium ablaze with their laya sallies, especially in the thani avarthanam. The audience responded with the same intensity through thunderous applause
