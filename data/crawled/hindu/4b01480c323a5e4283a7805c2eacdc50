VAdaunting pallavi in Hemavati -- &#8216;Saravananai Muruganai Guhanai Ninai' -- was Prema Rangarajan's choice, which was further extended to suit the kanda jathi ata talam. She, however, maintained a crisp raga profile, presenting a precise and embellished tanam and the lengthy pallavi in two segments.The repertoirePrema is a fastidious artist. She prefers to introduce lesser known kritis in well known ragas. This approach surely lends a charm to the concert. Take a look at her repertoire.A Tamil varnam in Gowla by Mayuram Viswanatha Sastry, &#8216;Kasi Visalakshi' in Gamakakriya by Dikshitar, &#8216;Sri Hari Vallabe' in Suddha Dhanyasi by Mysore Vasudevachar, &#8216;Parthasarathy' in Yadukulakhambodi (a tad slow) by Subbarama Dikshitar, &#8216;Emani Matladidivo' in Thodi by Tyagaraja and &#8216;Jaya Jaya' in Gambhira Nattai by Narayana Tirtha! They were enticing numbers in well known ragas!Rangarajan's raga treatises were treated with wisdom. They had the right proportion of karvai and brigas suitable to the chosen raga. She, therefore, sang a vivacious Suddha Dhanyasi, poignant Thodi and aesthetic Hemavati. The swara kalpanas followed definite designs and had well conceived permutations. The kuraippu and korvais were succinct, not stretching endlessly.The swaras for Suddha Dhanyasi and Thodi were testimony to this aspect. The swaras convergence in Thodi was delectable.Charulatha Ramanujam was a perfect match to Prema Rangarajan's mature presentation. Her fingering and bowing were powerful yet economical. The most important aspect was Charulatha's precise response to the vocalist's demands.Melakkaveri K. Balaji (mridangam) and Adambakkam K. Shankar( ghatam) were dignified partners. Their thani spoke well of their mutual understanding in sharing the honours.
