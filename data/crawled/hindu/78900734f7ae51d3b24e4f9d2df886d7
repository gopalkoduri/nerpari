VM .D. Pallavi's sugama sangeetha at Vasudevacharya Bhavana, Mysore, kept the audience spellbound as she unfurled Kannada poems of literary luminaries.At the same time, the event prompted for contemplation as to whether the present instance, drawing unreserved accolades, could stand alone as a tenable unique feature independent of the past. Under no circumstances, one can deny the energy and vigor her voice is endowed with, and the subtle tonal qualities it possessed. The gamut of her voice is another striking feature, indispensable in adorning great poetry. Further, carefully chiseled chords and adeptly acquired scholarship added the necessary weight to her style of singing.Irrefragably, these merits highlighted the singer's artistry and competence. However, to what extent she was successful in realising the very purpose of sugama sangeetha is something one needs to consider.Tuneful and meditative &#8220;Ajam Nirvikalpam&#8221;, the invocatory number dedicated to Lord Ganesha, instantly absorbed the mind. Nevertheless, the lyrics in Sanskrit were not comprehendible, though the melody radiated.The impact of Da. Ra. Bendre's &#8220;Naakutanti&#8221; was more or less similar. The beginning of the sangathis and the short interludes, were jerky with more than the necessary vigor; such movements frequently interrupted the free flow of melody.As the learned singer focused more on projecting the intricacies of the ragas, the sahitya frequently suffered either with slurs or with hard accentuations; and added to this, unnecessary articulations in the thara sthayi proved redundant and stentorian, though they displayed her sadhana.An average listener of bhavageethe-s naturally expects less of musical intricacies and more of expressions. The artiste's command over the vocal inflections and the gushing extempore, could only partly meet this end.Santha Shishunala Sharif's &#8220;He! Houdappa Houdu&#8221; was unable to carry the saint's spiritual import fully, because of the rather peculiar tuning and unnecessary punches.The following deserve enumeration: &#8220;Antharathanu&#8221; (K.V. Puttappa), &#8220;Helaldiddaru Ninu&#8221; (Lakshminarayana Bhatta), &#8220;Yavamohana Murali Kareyithu&#8221; (Gopalakrishna Adiga), and &#8220;Muchumare Illade&#8221; (K.V. Puttappa- tuned by Mysore Ananthaswamy).Bhanuvara Sanje Geleyara Balaga had arranged this programme to mark its first anniversary. Nagabhushana Udupa (key board), Madhusudan (tabla) and Priya Ramu (rhythm pad) accompanied the singer.
