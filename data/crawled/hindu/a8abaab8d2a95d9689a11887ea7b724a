VVasundhara Performing Arts Centre presented Pallavotsava-2010 dedicated to classical dance and music, for five days in Mysore. The festival offered platforms to young artistes from all over the country.On the second day, Pallavi Prasanna Madhyastha sang accompanied by two more young artistes, H.N. Smitha (violin) and Sai Shiva (mridanga).The vocalist is endowed with a powerful voice the range of which is quite adequate to meet the requirements of good music. Her style is lively and imagination admirable. Yet, the progressions could have been gentler and fine-tuned, an approach, which would have rendered her concert positively pleasing, in addition to those attractions the merits were able to impart. Akaras emerged freely, but were not smooth. Further, an overall composed methodology would have taken care of instances of occasional deviations from shruthi.The first two numbers, &#8220;Sakala Grahabala Neene&#8221; (Athana-Purandaradasa and &#8220;Svagatham Krishna&#8221; (Mohana- Oothukadu Venkatasubbayya) featured alapanas - elaborate and interesting.The focus of this short concert was Muthayya Bhagavathar's &#8220;Ambavani&#8221; in Keeravani. Expatiation of the raga exhibited the artiste's imagination, and the articulations were fluent. ***Bharatanatya by the duo, M.D. Sunitha and M.D. Vanitha, was one of the outstanding performances acknowledging refined taste (shaping the choreography), meticulous planning (achieving admirable balance), cutting- edge training (reaching near-perfection) and vision (foreseeing the final impact intended).The artistes drove home to establish themselves on the stage by directly introducing the audience to the varna, &#8220;Innum En Manam&#8221; (Charukeshi-Lalgudi Jayaraman), making best use of the limited time allotted for the slot.The agile and devoted artistes synchronised not only the physical movements but also their meaningful expressions. Be the activities pertaining to gross movements on the stage or the subtle ones to animate the theme on hand, the dancers would invariably complement each other.A right tempo provided adequate provisions to incorporate all the finer elements of the art form. With this ideal and accommodative pace, both the pure dance sections and the sections of sentimental expressions could nicely conform to the standards of clarity, crispness, comprehensibility and completeness.Because of the above comprehensive approach, even the jathis were able to induce pleasant moods. Lalithya as a rule reigned the entire show &#8212; graceful vinyasas and felicitous postures beautifying it and the abhinaya sections crowning it.&#8220;Gummana Kareyadire&#8221; (Ragamalika - Purandaradasa), Jaavali (Khamach - Patnam Subramanya Iyer) and a tillana (&#8220;Sumanisha Ranjani&#8221; - Shathavadhani Ganesh) were other highlights. Guru Revathi Narasimha (Nattuvanga), Balasubramanya Sharma (vocal), Jayaram (flute) and Chandrashekhar (mridanga) lent their inspiring support.***N.R. Mohalla Sangeetha Sabha had arranged Uma Money's vocal concert. Veena Suresh (violin) and M.R. Manjunath (mridanga) heeding the proprieties of ideal accompanists lifted the concert to appreciable heights.The singer has a pleasing voice, which retains its timbre irrespective of the octaves her imaginations chose to traverse. Occasional loss of balance with reference to notes may be attributable to a transient diffidence. Perhaps for the same reason, the swaraprastara sections betrayed lack of vitality in the early part of the concert (&#8220;Siddhi Vinayakam&#8221;- Chamara/Shanmukhapriya-Dikshithar).With the gain in the momentum, that initial diffidence transformed into definite confidence, and the concert eventually gained expected vigour and expressions (observe Shri Rajagopala - Saveri- Dikshithar). Melodious alapanas, devoid of flashy complexities had long lasting effects: one felt calm and quiet after having listened to her music - no pomposities, no ostentations. She presented the lyrics with the expected involvement fostering their respective moods.***N. Ravikiran played chitraveena as part of the eighth Cross Ganesha Festival Concert Series. Tuneful wafts redolent with rich resonance and melodic rapture captured the audience commanding unreserved accolades. This artiste possessing recognisable authority, set a trend - reviving traditional nuances. Remarkable control over the instrument, fortified by rare faculty of getting oneself deeply into different moods of the swara, of the framed phrases and of the raga-specific melodic movements, rendered his concert outstanding. Further, considerations extended to the imports of the lyrics, brought those presentations to artistic completions, they deserved and demanded.The accompanists Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi (violin), V. Ramanamurthy (mridanga) and Amrith (khanjira) contributed liberally and whole-heartedly inspiring each other, drawing cues from among themselves raising the concert to culminate in pleasant climaxes.
