VOpening his account briskly with a varnam in Hamsadhwani in two speeds, young vocalist Aditya Prakash moved on to &#8216;Theradhiyagaradha&#8217; (Gowlipantu, Tyagaraja) in his concert at TTD. An unexpected touch came in the form of kalpanaswaras tha\u000at delicately circled the lower reaches, before heading  to the middle register, with a brief nod to the upper register. Proportion was the key word here. A succinct sketch of Gowrimanohari was marked by sancharas rooted in azhutham. &#8216;Gurulekha&#8217; (Tyagaraja) was accessorised with niraval at &#8216;Tattvabodhana&#8217; and animated swaras at a different eduppu (&#8216;Teliakapodu&#8217;), both spirited efforts. The Suruti alapana, strengthened by  prayogas, rose above run-of-the-mill editions.  While a slower pace would have maximised bhava in &#8216;Nee Dayaradha&#8217; (Vasanthabhairavi, Tyagaraja), the vocalist&#8217;s clear understanding of raga swaroopa helped retain much of the composition&#8217;s poignancy.Vibrant madhyamakala phrasing, vadi samvadi features and open throated tara sthayi sancharas added punch to a serenely structured Khamas. The niraval and swaram accompanying &#8216;Seethapathe&#8217; (Tyagaraja) held points of interest that proclaimed a thinking approach. Deep jarus complementing nagaswaram-style interwoven passages made for a Subhapanthuvarali that impressed with effortless ease in execution. Sparkling brigas cascading from the tara sthayi gained in value through judicious usage &#8212; a  commendable trait that spoke of an artist who knows his strengths and capitalises on them without going overboard. &#8216;Sri Satyanarayanam&#8217; (Muthuswami Dikshitar) stood out for neat sangathis redolent with bhava. A flexible voice of rich timbre and tonal depth backed by clarity of concept  and an amalgam of proportion and aesthetics, all added up to one thing - Advantage Aditya! Karaikkal Venkatasubramaniam on the violin was unobtrusive and served up placid versions of Suruti and Subhapantuvarali. Tanjore Pravin Kumar&#8217;s percussive input (mridangam) enthused his fellow artists.
