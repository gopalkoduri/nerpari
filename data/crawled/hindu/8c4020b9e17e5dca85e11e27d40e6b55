Eruditely structured, Madhuri exhibited ambidexterity and charm and the concert ended up as a tasteful exposition.Well accompanied on the mridangam by Akashvani staff artiste D. Dharma Rao and M. Edukondalu on the ghatam, Madhuri got off to a brisk start playing Hamsanadam varnam. She brought out an exquisite essay of Begada ragam, making appropriate use of both the Kaisika and Kakali nishadams and surfaced the specific attributes of Madhyamam most scientifically. It turned out to be an aesthetic demonstration of her in-depth knowledge. chose to playAbhimanamennaduof Ramnad Sreenivasayyangar and accomplished the job very evocatively, attracting wholesome applause.Sarasa Samadanain Kapeenarayani had a fast tempo. This was followed by the sensitive elaboration ofHiranmayeem Lakshmeemof Dikshitar (Apuroopa ragam Lalitha). The prefix of raga and the concluding swaram exquisitely brought out the apoorva attributes of the raga (Upanga shadava janyam of the 15th Melam Mayamalavagoula), invigorating the Sangeetha Sahitya bhavas contained in the composition.The expansion of the rarely-heard composition of Papanasam Sivan,Samagana(Keeravani), with neravu and thani on the mridagam and the ghatam provided an enthralling climax. Madhuri delightfully concluded her recital playingYenthamaatramunaof Annamayya in Ragamalika.Presenting mementos, secretary D. Bhaskara Murty, said that the programme had been organised with the financial help of the children of the founder-members of the Sabha, Krovi Sundara Ramayya and his wife Sitaramana.
