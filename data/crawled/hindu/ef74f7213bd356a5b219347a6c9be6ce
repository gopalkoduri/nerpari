VThere is nothing better than music to carry one out of time. For nearly two hours S. Shashank did exactly this. The flautist virtually transported a packed audience at Thripunithura to a world of perfect harmony. The concert stood out for its sheer quality and amazing spontaneity. But even in this spontaneous overflow there was a clear method. Shashank, it seems, had a pattern in the choice of ragas and kritis.Shashank flagged off the concert with &#8216;Viriboni&#8230;' the popular Bhairavi ata tala varnam. This set a breezy tempo, that generated a vitality that continued till the end. The choice of compositions that followed, including the subsequent swara patterns kept the mood serene and the concert alive. He took up three Tyagaraja kritis, &#8216;Ragasudharasa&#8230;' (Andolika), &#8216;Vararagalaya&#8230;' (Chenchu Kamboji) and &#8216;Nada loludai...' (Kalyana Vasantham).All these compositions sing about the importance of raga, swara and nada. In one, Tyagaraja says, &#8220;the nectar of ragas gives one the beneficent results of yaga, yoga, tyaga and bhoga (enjoyment). Drink it, and enjoy.&#8221; In another one he goes further and says that people &#8220;have been boasting and deceiving the world that they are great masters of raga and laya without realising the significance of swara, subtle &#8216;murchana' and their variations.&#8221; And in the third, he says attain the highest bliss by losing oneself in nada, which is associated with variations of ragas, themselves the manipulations of the seven notes. Perhaps Shashank had a discreet message to impart in choosing these three compositions.In the delineation of all these, there was a marked sensitivity of tone, refined tonal quality, each of them artistically and aesthetically served.Centre pointThe centre point of the concert was a ragam-thanam-pallavi in Kalyani. Here Shashank moved away from the usual structure. He presented it in three specific talas. When he did, admirably supported on the mridangam by Paruppally S. Phalgun, on the violin by C. S. Anuroop and ghatam by Alappuzha Gopi, there was no deviating from the main raga, sustaining the prevalent mood. When he played the pallavi, Shashank painted subtle shades of Abheri and Saveri. In between, he even played two octaves, simultaneously.Another feature of the concert was the melodious rendering of Swati Tirunal kritis. Perhaps, this was a tribute by the young flautist to his guru K. V. Narayanaswamy, who did a lot to popularise Swati compositions.The lovely &#8216;Sumasayaka&#8230;' (Kaapi) was played very delicately. He gave a caressing touch; a wonderful sparkle. &#8216;Aliveni enthucheyvoo&#8230;' (Kurinji) was played with gliding ease. And when his magical flute created those incredible rhythms, heads nodded in unison, toes tapped and hands kept the beat. Shashank wound up the concert with brief expositions of &#8216;Sagara sayana vibho&#8230;' (Bhagyasri), &#8216;Raghuvamsa Sudha&#8230;.' (Kathanakuthoohalam) and a vibrant &#8216;Kavadi chindu.'The concert was held under the aegis of Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha.
