VDr. Satyavathi, an academician and a vocalist trained by veteran R.K. Srikantan, presented a traditionally-framed, highly restrained vocal recital to mark Mysore Vasudevachar Day at the Music Academy. Dr. Satyavathi chose to present some of the lesser known compositions of Vasudevachar on this occasion.Satyavathi's relaxed presentation of the compositions, a bit languid but not listless, created a comforting impact. Opening the concert with the attractive Mandhari varnam in Adi talam, the vocalist delved deep into the kriti &#8216;Bhajare Bhaja Manasamu' in Mohana Kalyani set to Rupaka talam. Satyavathi's broad niraval at &#8216;Paramaadputha Roopadaram' and her organised ways of structuring the swarakalpana with alluring designs showcased the artist's grasp on the raga's speciality.Ritigowla, a highly pliant and melodic raga was taken up for expansion. Here, Satyavathi made best endeavours to touch some of the delicious passages of the raga before settling for the exquisite number &#8216;Mama Hrudaye Vihara Dayalo' in Khanda Triputa. The swaras at the end were rather brief for this kriti.Main course&#8216;Manasa Vachasa Sirasa' a well rounded kriti eliciting the entire gamut of expressions of the raga Begada packed with a precise chittaswaram was the main course of the evening. Satyavathi's raga suit was done with carefully chosen phrases integrating them with a judicious mix of brigas towards the conclusion. In general, the raga essays were developed organically with long and redolent phrases. The charanam opening &#8216;Karunanvitam Kalyana Guna' was taken up for the treatise of niraval and swaras. The kuraippu swaras were seated on panchamam adding more appeal with the characteristic usage of &#8216;m m g r s' and &#8216;p d p s' prayogas.Usha Rajagopalan on the violin traced the vocalist closely giving good accounts of Ritigowla and Begada. She kept her control and never overstepped at any point. B. Ganapathyraman on the percussion performed with soft touches and strong precision. &#8216;Karuni Sow Thaaye' in Saraswathi Manohari (the only composition of Vasudevachar in Kannada language), &#8216;Gokula Nilaya Krupalaya' in Abheri and the final thillana in Kanada were the other items rendered.
