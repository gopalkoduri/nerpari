VB. M. Sundaram began his lecture on &#8220;Music tradition in temples&#8221;  with the observation that although the word &#8216;tradition&#8217; is bandied about when we talk of music, it is often observed more in the breach. The lecture was organis\u000aed by Saraswathi Vaggeyakkara Trust and Narada Gana Sabha.In India, music has been  synonymous with God. The Tamils praised God as the embodiment of music &#8212; &#8216;Pannin Isaiyaaga Nindrai Potri.&#8217; He then went on to discuss various aspects in detail.Royal patronage:The patronage that music had from kings is seen in temple inscriptions. Although today only men are odvuars, an inscription of the time of Veera Rajendra records the names of 16 women oduvars. During the reign of Raja Raja III, an entire agraharam was gifted to a dancer.Panns:There were rules about what panns should be sung in the different months of the year. For panns like Rashtrabhashai sung in the month of Purattasi, the Carnatic music equivalent is not known.Many musical instruments were used in temples &#8212; nagaswaram, kombu, tuttari, kinikittu, idakkai &#8212; to name a few. Araiyar sevai is a tradition that still continues in Srirangam, Sriviliputhur and Alwar Tirunagari. The &#8216;Kovil Ozhugu&#8217; details araiyar sevai.The fact that the nagaswaram is mentioned in the Rg Veda attests to its antiquity. Palani Mambazha Kavichinganavalar of the 19th century called it naga chinnam, and the word nayanam could be a variation of this.Thavil means &#8216;flawless&#8217; &#8212; &#8216;tha&#8217; meaning flaw and &#8216;il&#8217; meaning without. It is said that Ravana created the thavil to wake up Kumbhakarna.There are rules about what ragas have to be played before different sannidhis. Generally, Hamsanandi is played before the sannidhi of Kalyanasundarar. Nagaswaram and thavil are not played before Nataraja, Chidambaram being the exception.Talking about mallaris, Sundaram said when they are played by nagaswara vidwans, they are supposed to play only the ragas. Sahityam is not allowed. They begin the day by playing Gambhiranattai. This is a raga that signifies veera rasa, and it was perhaps felt that God, the protector, should wake up to the strains of such a raga. It has five swaras, and for some reason, five was considered auspicious both in Siva and Vishnu temples.There are different mallaris to mark different occasions. When the processional deity is brought near the chariot, mallari is played in triputa tala. Sundaram said he has heard triputa tala mallaris played for two and a half hours. Theertha mallari and Thaligai mallari are played during tirumanjanam and nivedhanam, respectively.When the deity reaches the Southern gopuram, rakthi is played. It is difficult to play rakthi. It&#8217;s a like a pallavi, without the purvangam and utharangam. When the deity reaches the Western gopuram, pallavi is played. Then comes the Hecharikai or the Padiyetram, and then the laali.In the past, when the deity was taken to the &#8216;pallai arai&#8217;, temple dancers would sing &#8216;kadhavu adai paattu&#8217;. This is how a 10-day temple festival would be celebrated, with individual variations.Sundaram then spoke about some unique traditions which are observed in temples. For example, in the Chidambaram Govindarajar sannidhi, during the Navaratri festival, &#8216;maalai maatrudhal&#8217; is observed. The bhattars sway to the tune of the nagaswaram, as they bring garlands for the God and Goddess to exchange. Five different songs are played everyday, so that over the nine day festival, one gets to hear 45 songs. In Avudayarkovil, only the gethu is played, and in Srirangam, the takkai is played.Dance too was as much part of temple worship as music, said Sundaram. Dancers would be up at four in the morning, to offer worship to the deity. In both Siva and Vishnu temples, dancers would do abhinaya near the bali peetam, during nivedhanam. They would also dance in the &#8216;thatti sutru mandapam.&#8217;Jainism and Buddhism did not look upon music favourably. But ironically, the Silappadikaaram and Manimekalai are the best records of ancient Tamil music! In a Jain temple in Mannargudi, even today the nagaswaram is played everyday.Sundaram had a few words of advice for nagaswara vidwans. He said they should not dilute tradition to attract audiences. Nor should they clamour for sabha concerts. The nagaswaram is not intended for a sabha. In the past, nagaswara vidwans had to play ragas for over two hours, since sahityam was not allowed. This led to their giving full play to their creativity. To them goes the credit of fostering and nourishing classical music. Sundaram&#8217;s lecture was bolstered by nagaswaram recordings that he played.
