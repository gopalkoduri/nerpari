V&#8220;I used to play the saxophone on occasions like weddings and fairs. I learnt Carnatic singing from Guru Gopalkrishna Aiyer&#8221;. Gopalnath has put it to good use in playing the saxophone. &#8220;My debut on the concert platform was in 1976. At the Chembai Memorial Trust, Chennai. An honour, indeed. It was a resounding success.&#8221; And the resounding has followed him wherever he plays. He has been having a string of concerts at home and abroad. He is a big draw at any concert. Globetrotting has been as easy for him as flitting from Bangalore to Mysore or from Hubli to Dharwad for that matter. He has performed in Switzerland, England, America, Canada, Germany, Australia, Singapore, Bahrain, Qatar, Muscat, Malaysia and Sri Lanka.Not content with mere Carnatic music on the saxophone, Kadri has done extensive experiments in fusion music. He ranks with the likes of Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, Jasraj, Zakir Hussain in popularising Indian music in the West. A high quality fusion musician that he is, Kadri Gopalnath has participated in Jazz Festivals at Prague and Berlin. He had the distinction of taking part in the International Saxophone Festival held at Latvia in 2003, as also the rare honour of playing at the Golden Jubilee Coronation of Queen Elizabeth of England. He is the first Carnatic musician to perform at the Royal Albert Hall in London on invitation from the BBC, Kadri Gopalnath has toured England in duet concerts with the celebrated saxophonist Evan Parker. He has collaborated with renowned Jazz Flautist, James Newton of U.S. for a fusion album called Southern Brothers. The theme was global peace and harmony. Kosmic Music has brought out in four volumes Kadri Gopalnath&#8217;s blockbuster fusion album, &#8220;Dream Journey&#8221;.Would films leave him alone? He is in demand. K. Balachander, the great Tamil film director used Kadri&#8217;s saxophone for his film &#8220;Duet&#8221;. With the talented A.R. Rahman as music director. But as usually happens with many, Kadri hasn&#8217;t lost himself in the glitter of film music. His first love, however, has always been classical music. Kadri is the first Carnatic musician to get A top grade from AIR in 1997. In 2004, the Padmashri and followed by the Central Sangeet Natak Academy Award. And on its heels in 2006, Honorary Doctorate from Bangalore University. Kadri is also the recipient of Kalaimamani from Tamil Nadu Government and Rajyotsava Award from Karnataka Government.  He was given Purandara Award in February 2008 and on March 13, 2008, he is going to be conferred the Puttaraj Samman at Dharwad. A new feather in his crown. In Kadri&#8217;s view: &#8220;Puttaraj Samman has been conferred on nine stalwarts before me. To me, the Samman is a blessing from the saint-musician Dr. Puttaraj Gawai.&#8221;The credit for raising the saxophone to the status of the Mangala Vadya is all Kadri Gopalanath&#8217;s. In order to perpetuate the glorious tradition he has built up, Kadri has been training hundreds of disciples. About 25 of his disciples are notable performers today. &#8220;Should the Government of Karnataka gift me a site, I have a dream of running a free saxophone education centre.&#8221;
