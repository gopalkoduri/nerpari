VT. K. GANAPATHYPerformance technique and  virtuosity bring out the refinement of Carnatic music in a kutcheri.  The  communicative skills, loftiness of expression and clarity of diction made music sublime at the vocal recital of Sreeramkumar and Ravi Prasad (Malladi Brothers) for Manoranjitham at Sree Ayyappan Puja Sangham in Coimbatore. A winsome presentation of the Kedaragowla varnam, `Samidaya,' in two speeds revealing vidwat and manodharma marked the beginning. "Neevanti Deivamu" with swaras and "Pattividuvaraadu" in raga Manjari  were charming.Serene and pleasingSreeramkumar's Bilahari alapana for "Karpagambike" delighted the rasikas with a profusion of sancharas and gamakas. Ravi Prasad's delineation of "Ninne Nammithi" was  pleasing. Camouflaging tonal manipulations with aplomb, their depiction of the main raga, Sankarabharanam  for the song, "Sarojadalanetri" was serene with the predominance of the influence of sahitya. The roller-coaster swara exercise following the neraval clicked well with the rasikas. Srikanth's accompaniment on the violin was of high quality with soft and gentle bowing. His solo versions of Bilahari, Simhendramadhyamam and Sankarabharanam flowed with majestic grace.The punch-packed tani from the dynamic percussive support of Narayanaraju (mridangam) and Suresh (ghatam) added dignity to the recital.Bottom Template Starts
