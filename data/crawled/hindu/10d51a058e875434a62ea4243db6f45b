VThe management committee of Visakha Music and Dance Academy, which usually features concerts of classical music organized a recital of Telugu geet, ghazals and devotional songs for a change in its auditorium Kalabharathi last Saturday. The chosen artiste was K.S. Chandrasekhar, who retired as music composer, Akashavani, Visakhapatnam studios, after superannuation last month.As a child, Sekhar was hailed as a prodigy donning child roles in Telugu padyanatakams, mythological in particular, and later on mastered playing the harmonium and singing light music under the tutelage of playback singer and music director late Ghantasala Venkateswararao.Sekhar was given a break to sing for the feature filmBantrothubharyaby late Ramesh Naidu and then got the opportunity to compose for some films between 1971 and 1982. This and the experience of giving public concerts got him selected by Akashvani as a music composer for its studios at Visakhapatnam in 1991. It is at the Akashavani studios in Visakhapatnam that his potential for composing was tapped into. Besides winning three national merit certificates for the studios, he succeeded in getting a national award for the musical featureRasanaadam.He and his disciple K. Sudharani regaled the audience at Kalabharathi for over two hours. They sang 20 compositions of Annamayya, Purandharadas, Meera, Narayanatheertha and many a contemporary lyricist individually and together. These were compositions set to music earlier by him and broadcast from the Visakhapatnam studios on special occasions.B. Ramanamurty and K. Siva on tabla, Saikumar on keyboard and V. Kurmanatham on flute lent excellent support. K. Lakshminarayanamma, S. Meenakshi, Ch. Sandhya Sundar, Ayesha and C.A.N. Atreya occasionally joined the chorus for select songs. A neat effort, it kept all in the auditorium well engaged.
