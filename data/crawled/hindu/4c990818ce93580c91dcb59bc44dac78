VS. Sowmya sang under the auspices of SPVGMC Trust as part of series of Ganesha Festival Concerts. Nalina Mohan (violin), H.S. Sudhindra (mridanga) and M. Gururaj (morsing) accompanied her.An overview of the concert, in the light of the cherished artiste's potentials and competence sums up the general impression in favour of swarakalpana, alapana and lyrics in the order of the interest they created. The artiste's pleasing voice rendered the concert melodious, yet the renditions lacked emotive content. To a certain extent, the concert revealed deficiencies in planning the general layout too.Consider her second number, &#8220;Shiva Shiva Shiva Enarada&#8221; of Thyagaraja (Panthuvarali). A raga that embodied both veera rasa and bhakthi, and the composition which demanded expressions fostering sublime contemplation could not gain perceptible support from either the narrative quarters or from an emotive angle. A slightly faster tempo and want of right stresses on sentiment-rich areas of the text rendered the number arid and mechanical, though scholarly in the usually accepted sense.Further, the manner in which she framed the kalpanaswaras inclined more towards establishing her astounding grip over the rhythm. Ideally, these sections should have served as an extension of the moods of Bhakthi and surrender impregnated in the main body of the number.The process needed gentle approach with pronounced soft intonations. However, swarakalpana section, when considered as a separate unit, made a quick impression, commanding unreserved accolades: the process eventually threw more challenge to the percussionist than any to the melody accompanist.In contrast to the above number stood Ponnayya Pillai's &#8220;Amba Nilambari&#8221; (Nilambari) - the general tempo, the lilting movements and gracefully executed gamakas collectively made it pleasing and absorbing.To exemplify the deficiency in proportion, consider &#8220;Smaraneyonde Saalade&#8221; (Malayamarutha-Purandaradasa). With detailed alluring alapana preceding, and a good neraval at &#8220;Sakalathirthayatreya&#8221; expanding the composition, a few passages of swarakalpana would have done ample justice to the number in achieving an overall balance.Alternatively, the learned singer could have advantageously appended the above composition with kalpanaswaras, dispensing with either &#8220;Sudha Madhurya Bhaashana&#8221; (Sindhuramakriya &#8211;Thyagaraja &#8212; a mellifluent rendering) or &#8220;Bhajare Manasa&#8221; (Abheri-Vasudevacharya). The latter could have been a better option for omission in such an eventuality: she could not get the (from &#8220;Bhajare Manasa&#8221;) shades of such vision or sentiments the composer had in mind when he was portraying the Lord as serenely beautiful and the one to bestow bhakthi and mukti. In elaborating Kamboji, the violinist scored over the lead artiste in exposing the essence of the raga to the easy and quick comprehension of even an average listener. Pallavi, &#8220;Elana Swami&#8221;, emerged vivaciously - the swarakalpana ending with ragamalika in very quick succession, not allowing the listeners sufficient time to enjoy them.In a way, the percussionists served as the cynosure of the event, imparting an element of versatility to the concert. Other highlights were &#8220;Ela Ni Dayaradu&#8221; (Atana-Thyagaraja &#8212; featuring moderately drawn alapana and swarakalpana), &#8220;Malmuruga Shanmukha&#8221; (Vasantha-Papanasam Sivan), &#8220;Smara Sundaranguni&#8221; (Jaavali/Padam-Faraz-Dharmapuri Subbaraya) and Thillana (Dhanashri-Swathi Thirunal).
