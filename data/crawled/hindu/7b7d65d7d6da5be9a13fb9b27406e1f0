VShe is the first woman artiste in the country to storm the male bastion and become a professional mridangam player. As articulate as the rhythm that gushes from her percussion, Dandamudi Sumathi recalls her love for the instrument from a very tender age, &#8220;an age when gender significance hardly exists&#8221;. Recipient of the Best Mridangist Award thrice by Madras Music Academy and also an &#8216;Amateur' Awardee (Central government), she honestly admits that the creator (Brahma) had ordained that she master this Herculean art (Brahma Vidya) and so it happened.&#8220;My father Nidumolu Raghavayya was a mridangam vidwan and my very first guru. My mother Venkataratnamma was my pillar of strength. We were a large family of 14 children and economically in a bad shape. My father had, in those days, a great fascination for Dandamudi Ramamohan Rao's style of playing the percussion and wanted to admit me as a pupil under this great mridangam vidwan. Accordingly in 1960, I was presented before the stalwart who advised my father to admit me into a music school. And it was only in 1964 after my certificate course did I gain an entry in his tutelage. I remember at that tender age, I was asked to give a demo and he rewarded me with a fine compliment that which was a blessing for me. He told my father that I would make it big one day and that he would definitely teach me. What more could I ask?&#8221; her voice quivers with emotion even now when she recalls her experience.When was she personally impressed by Dandamudi? &#8220;I would accompany my father to concerts by great musicians as part of an exposure for a learning child. In one such kutcheri, I heard Dandamudi playing for Mangalampalli. While the rest of the audience, I'm sure were enslaved by the genius vocalist, my ears and eyes were tuned to the percussionist, &#8221; she laughs.Sumathi had to stop performing for a year in public, a condition her guru put while under his tutelage. The family had to undergo a lot of tribulations as her performances were a source of income to make both ends meet. How did the sishya turn into a sahadharmacharini (wife)? &#8220;Laya was the binding force of our love which united us in wedlock. I consider myself immensely fortunate to have been blessed by such a life partner though he left me half way for his heavenly abode. He was a treasure house of knowledge and what more, a wonderful human beingBut for him, I would have been forced by circumstances to give up my art long ago,&#8221; her voice is choked with emotion.Together they had number of kutcheris to their credit not to talk of duo concerts on the mridangam alone. Even to this day, Sumathi is a performer. She is also moulding her young daughter SriLaya in percussion. She has founded Laya Vedike an organisation that promotes the mridangam in memory of her husband.
