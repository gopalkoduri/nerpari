VThe vardhanti (birthday) of  the present pontiff of the Sringeri Math is on Chaitra Sukla Sasht, when  thousands throng  Sringeri to receive the blessings of the swami.Math administrator V.R.Gowrishankar points out the specific scenes of this day, helping us visualise the total ambience.It opens  with the swami worshipping at the Malahanikareswara Temple.The birthday begins with Anhika Darshanam (darshan of the swami engaged in His morning anushtanam) followed by Khasa Puja (special puja) to Sharada Devi.In the evening, the swami gives darshan to the disciples and then graces a public function. The function starts with Vedic chants. Many languages are represented indicating the spread of the math&#8217;s  influence across caste,  and language. Yajna Subramaniam from the U.S. says  the acharya is  a Vyasa for the disciples.P.R. Ramasubramania Raja pleads with the acharya to undertake vijaya yatra in Tamil Nadu while Hariprasad Rao, Guntur,  is overwhelmed by the mere presence of this glowing spirituality.Directed by Ramesh Begar, the documentary which opens with the flowing waters of  River Tunga in Sringeri, encircled by the hills of Malnad, concludes with the Swami&#8217;s anugraha bhashanam.He begins with the tremendous achievements of Adi Sankara in a life-span of just 32  years. A tremendous foresight had made Sankara start the Sringeri Math in an area where nature had ceased to be red in tooth and claw, for the Yoga Sutras say that natural foes become friends in the presence of great people who follow ahimsa.The first pontiff Sureshwaracharya was the eldest and most scholarly among Sankara&#8217;s disciples. Whereas other disciples sought Sankara, it was Sankara who had sought out Sureshwaracharya, taught him that his Karma Siddhanta was flawed and made him his earnest disciple. Since then scholarship and headship have gone hand in hand in Sringeri.On the auspicious occasion of Vardhanti, the poor and handicapped are not forgotten either. Adequate help is disbursed since the math is very conscious about suffering humanity.The vardhanti celebrations conclude with the Mahaswami performing puja to Ganapati and Chandramowliswara in Narasimhavana.Soft background music and the clear voice of Shankar Prasad as narrator make the CD valuable.Produced by Sri Bharati Theertha Cultural &amp; Folk Research Centre Trust, Sringeri.Available with the administrator, Sri Sharada Peetam, Sringeri &#8211; 577139, Ph: 08265 &#8211; 250123 and at Sringeri Shankara Math, 97, Ammamandapam Road, Srirangam, Tiruchi.(Ph: 0431 &#8211; 2436343)Price: Rs.100
