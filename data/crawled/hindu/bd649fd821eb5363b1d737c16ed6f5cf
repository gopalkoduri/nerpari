VNithyasree MahadevanVolumes 1 and 2Aditya Music (India) P ltdMRP Rs 150 per volume.Nithyasree Mahadevan puts to good use her facile voice which is capable of traversing up to the Tharasthayi shadjam, in this twin-CD album. Recorded live in a concert,  Nithyasree is found presenting  compositions made popular by artists from differe\u000ant schools of Carnatic music. She is ably supported on the violin by M.A. Krishnaswamy and on the mridangam by her father I. Sivakumar. Ghatam accompaniment has been provided by R. Murali.The slight breathlessness in the vocalist&#8217;s voice noticed during the opening varnam in Sahana happily vanishes to make listening a pleasure. &#8216;Mariyada Gadayya&#8217; (Bhairavam-Tyagaraja ) which follows the varnam is a vigorous exposition of the kriti and draws the attention of the listener. A brief alapana of the vivadhi raga Chandrajyothi is a clear-cut essay. The song rendered is &#8216;Sashivadana&#8217; (Tyagaraja ) which extols Lord Siva. The kalpana swarams employing a good deal of janta prayogas arrive with precision at the pallavi. Nithyasree renders this song well which confines to the version of T.M. Tyagarajan.The opening of the Arabhi raga vinyasa establishes without any ambiguity the swaroopa of the melody. Ponnaiah Pillai&#8217;s beautiful composition &#8216;Amba Souramba&#8217; on Goddess Brihannayaki enshrined in the famous big temple at Thanjavur is a good selection. Nithyasree tends to be slightly dramatic when raga snatches are sung after the second charanam, while dwelling upon the upper shadjam. The influence of the Maharajapuram School is evident in the Arabhi raga alapana and raga phrases during the course of the kriti rendering.A relaxed rendering of a sloka &#8216;Nama Ugraya Veeraya Saarangaya&#8217; precedes the Tamil song &#8216;Kaarana Karana&#8217; on the sun god which has been composed by the vocalist&#8217;s mother Lalitha Sivakumar. The song is clothed in the currently named raga Surya. This raga, as per the ancient Carnatic music treatises, is Sallapam. The sloka is offered with a lot of involvement and accounts for tranquil listening pleasure. The sloka rendering outshines the song which follows.Nostalgic memories of M.S. Subbulaksmi do set in while listening to the vocalisation of &#8216;Giridhara Gopala&#8217; (Mohanam-Papanasan Sivan). The first volume comes to a close with the ragamalika &#8216;Velan Varuvaarodi.&#8217;Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Ardhanareeswaram&#8217; in the delicate raga &#8216;Kumudakriya&#8217; is the first song in the second volume. The outline of the raga sung is appealing with apt plain notes and karvais. While rendering the Madhyama kala sahitya at the close of the charanam, Nithyasree sings initially as &#8216;Amareshadi Sevitham&#8217; and while repeating the sahitya sings as &#8216;Amareshadi Sannutham.&#8217; This could have been a slip. The correct usage would be &#8216;Amareshadi Sevitham.&#8217;A raga bhava laden vinyasa of Keeravani (Kaligiyunte-Tyagaraja) studded with clear brigas is the major effort. The violinist contributes with a good essay of the melody. The niraval at &#8216;Bhagavatha&#8217; is a bit short of what one would expect from the singer. An Azhwar pasuram, &#8216;Kulam Tharum&#8217; is elaborately rendered followed by a Bhadrachalam Ramadas composition in Valaji. Nithyasree springs a surprise by singing the popular Purandaradasa devarnama &#8216;Bhagyatha Lakshmi&#8217; in Mishra Bowli, according to the version of Pandit Bimsen Joshi.Peaceful music sets in with &#8216;Shanti Nilava vendum&#8217; (Tilang- Sethu Madhava Rao). The curtains fall with a thillana in Nalinakanthi composed by K.S. Raghunathan.The thani avarthanam by the percussionists at the close of &#8216;Kaligiyunte&#8217; and their accompaniment for the songs speak volumes of their experience.
