VMudikondan S.N. Ramesh&#8217;s veena recital under the auspices of Ganabharathi, Mysore, kept the audience spellbound.  In support of the gentle artiste, P.S. Shridhar (on the mridanga) exercised discretion in mellowing the beats and S. Manjunath (ghata) consciously trod his path preserving the delicacies of the progressions.Ramesh has imbibed and nurtured a healthy predisposition of dedicating himself to the instrument as well as focussing his attention on the essence of the compositions. As a result, one could find throughout his concert, due importance given to the lyrical aspects.He had carefully selected the compositions like Purandaradasa&#8217;s &#8220;Smaraneyonde Saalade&#8221; (Malayamarutha), Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Mokshamu Galada&#8221; (Saramati) and Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Hiranmayim Lakshmim&#8221; (Lalitha) - all demanding serious approaches, which in fact, he successfully made.A short and pleasing alapana in Malayamarutha preceded &#8220;Smaraneyonde Salade&#8221; rendered in vocal style. When he simultaneously sang the lyrics, the audience could experience its meaning blended with the wafts of melody the instrument emanated.Indeed, alapana in Lalitha comprising opulence of portamenti - ascending, descending (some with rests in intermediate notes, some with undulating movements) - was outstanding. Nevertheless, there were also moments where he tripped, causing alien swaras to enter into the passages.Similar discrepancy crept into other presentations too, for example, while he was composing kalpanaswaras in Ranjani (&#8220;Ranjani Niranjani&#8221; - G.N.B), and while elaborating Saaramati.Yet, &#8220;Mokshamu Galada&#8221; was an excellent piece of imagination, visualisation and scholarship. Particularly in the swarakalpana section, the mood that he created simply ushered the mind into a sublime state, the lyrics of high spiritual order and the raga embodies great sentimental significance. Throughout, the wire plectrum - string contacts (particularly in faster paces) and the intensity of plucking (particularly in executing long amplitude glides), interfered with smooth flow experience.***Bhasange Balaga, a new cultural organisation came into force at the Veene Sheshanna Bhavana, to enrich the cultural world of Mysore.It is heartening that a group of youngsters have taken  upon themselves this task to conserve Indian heritage. H.R. Leelavathy, senior exponent of Sugama Sangeetha, inaugurated the function; K.B. Ganapathy, Editor, The Star of Mysore, was the chief guest; and G.R. Nagaraj, noted social worker, presided.True to its pledge, the Balaga had organised Sugama Sangeetha by Shimoga Subbanna and party. The septuagenarian&#8217;s deep voice mesmerised the audience.Most of the songs emerged from his memory, and conveyed the desired emotions and sentiments instantaneously. Kuvempu&#8217;s &#8220;Trinamapi Nachalati&#8221; and &#8220;Anandamaya&#8221;, Shishunal Sharif&#8217;s &#8220;Kodagana Kolinungitha&#8221;, Siddaiah Puranik&#8217;s &#8220;Enaadaru Aagu&#8221; were some of the best examples.Seema Raikar, accompanied the veteran, imparting variety to the program, singing B.M. Shri&#8217;s &#8220;Karunalu Ba Belake&#8221;, Kuvempu&#8217;s &#8220;Baa Thaaye Ilidubaa&#8221; and &#8220;Doora Bahudara&#8221;, Da.Ra. Bendre&#8217;s &#8220;Ghama Ghama&#8221; and so on.The orchestra comprised Manasi Prasad (mandolin), Ravi (keyboard), Mallikarjun (tabla) and Padiyar (rhythm pad).
