VThe accompanists were H.N.Baskar on the violin, P. Sathish Kumar on the mridangam, R.V.Ramani on the ghatam and R. Raman on the morsing. The programme got under way with a sloka in Hindolam and Atana followed by &#8216;Tyagaraja&#8217; also in Atana. &#8216;Narahariyai&#8217; in Simhendramadhyamam was packed with a few interesting avartanas of swaraprasthara.Sahana was a brief soothing, bhava-filled dissertation featuring many traditional &#8216;pidis&#8217; that were imbued with much musical grace. The violinist has made significant strides in the performing sphere, and his alapana of sahana had flights of beauty and imagination.Thodi was elaborated with care in the madhya and tara sthayis with the singer concentrating on the essentials, and not indulging in irrelevant, flamboyant expression. The rich talent of the violinist was showcased impressively in his response. The Tamizh viruttam and &#8216;Kandadhum Kanavo&#8217; on Lord Rama had a creditable devotional bearing with the quality to provide spiritual nourishment. The expansion of the sahitya and the swarakalpana were commendable in form and structure.The Arabhi kriti extolling Devi Meenakshi in the sacred precincts at the temple at Madurai, and praying for her mercy and compassion, were beautifully tuned in Arabhi and sung with passion. Incidentally, Ambujam Krishna&#8217;s lyrics were given tuneful attire by great vidwans such as Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, Musiri Subramania Iyer, V.V.Sadagopan, S.Ramanathan and M.D.Ramanathan, among other stalwarts.Kalyani was delineated with simplistic, yet effective prayogas that had a strong melodic force.The tanam by both the vocalist and violinist received instant approbation from the audience. The pallavi set to Adi tala was intelligently conceived with the Sahitya &#8216;Guruvayurappane Appan Ambujakshan.&#8217; The niraval was endowed with chowka, Madhyama and Durita Kala phrases in the right proportion.The swara kuraippu in the Nishada was precise with the violinist and the percussion artistes contributing enthusiastically to maintain the momentum.The ragamalika solfa chains in the pallavi invariably find a positive rasika response and Aruna&#8217;s &#8216;Kannada&#8217; in the Madurai Mani Iyer mould, Dharmavati that had quite a few shades of Madhuwanti, Ritigowla, Chenchurutti with a folksy flavour and Karnaranjani were manna to the delighted audience. Each raga hit the target to the Pallavi sahitya of Ambujam&#8217;s composition in that specific melody.The tani avartanam was a brisk, orderly team effort with the rhythmic skills of each Vidwan coming to the fore with pinpoint accuracy.A Satya Sai hymn in Nattakuranji, sweet tidbits in Hamsanandi Brindavani and the popular &#8216;Gana Mazhai&#8217; tuned by Anantalakshmi Sadagopan furnished the colourful icing on the cake.
