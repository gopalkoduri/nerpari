VS. SIVAKUMAR"Imagination governs mankind," Injikkudi Subramaniam seemed to say along with Napoleon, as he cast his spell yet once again.Performing with his magic wand &#151;  the nagaswaram &#151;  for Chennai Fine Arts, Subramaniam re-affirmed that the shehnai stood disguised in his nagaswaram. His manner of cosy blowing consciously redefined the concert itself. One here is not talking about  some plaintive notes or speed bits or some subtle nuances that remind you of the shehnai. It was a presentation that brought alive the shehnai in a wholesome manner, the kind of playing that leaves you with moist eyes as the final notes fade away.Ahirbhairav (`Pibare Ramarasam,' Sadhasiva Brahmendra), Sindhu Bhairavi (`Thamboori Meetidhava' -Purandara Dasar) and Desh (Tillana-Lalgudi) transported you to a state of greatest pleasure. And if you were keen on unmixed Carnatic content, that was available with `Evarimata' (Khambodi, Tyagaraja) or a rare piece `Muruga Thirumal Maruga' (Harikhambodi, Sankara Iyer) or `Baagayyanayya' (Chandra Jyothi, Tyagaraja).For those who relish racy numbers there was `Shobillu Sapthaswara' (Jaganmohini, Tyagaraja) with the spray of swaras, sometimes even getting suppressed by the beat of the tavils. Nagaswaram support from Ramanathan was complementary in nature.The thavil vidwans Thirukkadayur Babu and Nangoor Selvaganapathy gave laya support, which filled the gaps with contained outbursts, and gave a thani that brought out the competitive urge in them.The venue, Gokhale Shastri Institute, Shanmugasundaram Hall (Luz, Mylapore), is ideal for a chamber concert and has a false roofing to boot. So what does it suggest? Perhaps, a mikeless nagaswaram concert could have been tried for that blissful experience minus  the maddening discomfort of noisy amplification.Bottom Template Starts
