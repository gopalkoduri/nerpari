V&#8220;Sing with sincerity and be your own audience,&#8221; says Alka Deo Marulkar, the Hindustani vocalist of Agra gharana. &#8220;Classical music needs a hands-on approach and cannot come by merely getting a university degree in it &#8211; rigorous practice for about four to five  hours a day and constant meditative contemplation on a raga is required for the music to be of high quality&#8221;, adds the sincere musician who trains  a number of students privately and through Goa&#8217;s Kala Academy (in the capacity of Director) with her scientific teaching methodology.She speaks of a time when the  artiste submitted like a fakir to music.  &#8220;Today, the trend is quite different &#8211; artistes give importance to the marketing of their product, publicity and handsome remuneration; this has led to insecurity among artistes. While on the one hand this market orientation has resulted in a professionally perfect artiste , it has also given rise to a mind-set that cashes on tried and tested stuff,&#8221; says this second generation artiste, who, as it appears, not only focuses on the goal, but enjoys the journey as well.Describing Jaipur-gharana&#8217;s signature style as &#8220;Ras (eloquence) and Kas (concise/precise gist),&#8221; Dr. Alka enumerates Jaipur gharana&#8217;s salient features as singing jod-raga (double raga), serpentine taan, projection of the space between two rhythm cycles (taal), singing equivalent vakra taans for vakra ragas (if a raga doesn&#8217;t have a straight forward ascending/descending scale, then how can a taan be straight forward she questions?), and a bandish that is tautly wound around the cycle of beats. &#8220;In this gayaki, the raga can be seen objectively without the influence of the personality rendering it,&#8221; adds this sought-after artiste. Differentiating Jaipur gharana from others, she feels laya is dealt in &#8220;a subtle way, with a meandering of notes&#8221; and is &#8216;somewhere in between a more relaxed Kirana/Patiala gharana (with respect to laya), and a more laya focused Agra gharana.&#8221;Alka draws her inspiration from her gurus - father Gaan Ramaiyya Pt. Rajabhau Deo (the outstanding vocalist of Gwalior, Kirana and Jaipur gharanas) and Pt. M.S. Kanetkar (veteran artiste of Jaipur gharana).  She remembers being taught bandish-es by her father at age four. &#8220;My father had a vision for me to be an artiste and I have absolutely no regrets that he made that decision for me. I hadn&#8217;t thought of it as a profession then, but I knew I had to be a cut above the ordinary. Fame and money were not at all the considerations,&#8221; adds this A-grade AIR artiste for whom music is &#8216;tapasya&#8217;.She adds that the best gayaki of the three gharanas was taught to her by her father and at 35, her own style began to emerge. A few years later her gayaki had crystallised with its hallmark purity of raga, accuracy and precision with laya, melody, and above all the ability to transcend her audiences to a divine plane.Her own style can be described as aesthetic, imaginative, yet highly intellectual, replete with lilting lyrical expressions, emotive appeal and fresh interpretation, qualities that set her in a class of her own.  Her well-received creations like ragas Anand Kalyan, Jogeshri and Shyam-Malhar stand testimony to her brilliance.In addition, she has composed and tuned several bandish-es, and has brought out albums which are tuned and sung by her, like &#8220;Premanjali&#8221; &#8211; a compilation of Meera bhajans and &#8220;Madhugat&#8221; &#8211; a selection of Marathi poetry.Here is one maestro who not only believes in putting her soul into music, but being a pure-soul too!
