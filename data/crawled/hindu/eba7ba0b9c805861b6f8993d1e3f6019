VRarely does a concert begin with a Pancharatna kriti. Prarthana Rao started her recital for Thyagaraja Seva Samithi in Obul Reddy Hall, Vanimahal, with the Gowla Pancharatnam &#8216;Dudugu gala,&#8217; where Tyagaraja repents for the innumerable misd\u000aeeds he had done. The audio system that played truant caused a break as the  artists stopped  for the system to gain some balance.But the intrusion did not prevent Prarthana, endowed with a voice ideal for Carnatic music &#8212; neither too high pitched nor too low &#8212; from presenting a good fare.Scheduled on Bagula Panchami day, the programme was in fact all-Tyagaraja.  A quick round of swaras in Kannda for &#8216;Ide bhagyamu&#8217; preceded the fully energetic &#8216;Sobillu sapthaswara&#8217; (Jaganmohini.) In fact,Prarthana essayed three ragas that evening &#8212; Begada (&#8216;Nee pada pankaja&#8217;), Pantuvarali (&#8216;Raghuvara nannu&#8217;) and Kharaharapriya (&#8216;Rama nee samana mevaru&#8217;). Perhaps Prarthana saved her creativity and energy for the main Kharaharapriya. Begada and Pantuvarali, therefore were a little terse and sketchy.Kharaharapriya was aesthetically structured with grammatical accuracy. Prarthana&#8217;s choice of long and short phrases coalesced well with the musical charm of the raga.The composition was also rendered with care and her selectively poised niraval and kalpanaswaras at &#8216;Paluku paluku&#8217; highlighted the raga&#8217;s beauty. Rao&#8217;s swara sections were parsimonious; however, here she was quite indulgent and centred her various permutations landing on &#8216;panchamam.&#8217;The fast paced &#8216;Sarasa sama dana&#8217; (Kapinarayani) and &#8216;Vara ragalaya&#8217; (Chenjukhambodi) sandwiched the slow and sober &#8216;Entaninne&#8217; in Mukhari. Prarthana Rao&#8217;s musical equipment needs to be honed with special attention in the area of internalised articulation. Still,  one could feel the  emotions surging through  &#8216;Entaninne&#8217; and &#8216;Rama nee samana&#8217;.Usha Rajagopalan on the violin escorted the young singer with extra care in the raga expositions and her swaraprastharas with Thanajavur Kumar&#8217;s rhythmic contribution blended well with the overall picture.
