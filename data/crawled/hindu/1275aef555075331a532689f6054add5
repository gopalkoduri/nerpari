VThe senior musician stuck to her convictions on convention at every stage of her programme without an iota of compromise to woo the gallery. Even her starting varnam &#8216;Sarasooda&#8217; in Saveri followed the three column style (first, second and madyama) unlike the common practice of first and madyama. It was also a presage for the elaborate Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi in Saveri which came much later set in Tisra Triputa -4 kalai Pallavi.If one overlooks the traceable strains in the upper registers, Seetha Narayanan&#8217;s full throated articulation was absolutely immaculate. As a mark of appreciation she introduced a couple of compositions of Nadopasana Srinivasan in Sama (&#8216;Tumbikai Nadha&#8217;) and Charukesi (&#8216;Hanumane Num&#8217;) whose book of compositions was released on the eve. Seetha Narayanan also presented &#8216;Sri Sachithananda Kantham&#8217; in Vachaspathi preceded by a brief alapana and swaraprasthara in &#8216;Sarva Jeevathma.&#8217; This kriti of Meesu Krishna Iyer was said to be tuned and popularised by Alathur Brothers. Two  &#8216;gana&#8217; ragas  Sankarabharanam (&#8216;Entuku Beddala&#8217;) and Saveri (RTP) shared equal importance in the programme. In the former, Seetha&#8217;s focus was more on the niraval of &#8216;Vedasasthra&#8217; turning that into the highlight of the whole rendition. Almost on the same approach, in the RTP the four Kala Pallavi drew more attention than Ragam and Tanam.Seetha Narayanan&#8217;s swara passages  were simple but charming.  Perhaps the glamour was the ragamalika string she attached to  the pallavi &#8216;Kari Mora Lina Veda Hare Krishna&#8217; in Simhendramadyamam, Begada, Revati and Desh. Her raga expressions were framed on decisively time honoured mode. Usha Rajagopalan&#8217;s violin support was well in sync with the vocalist perceptions. Nevertheless, Usha needs appreciation for blending a few extra finer touches to her raga versions in Vachaspathi and Saveri to offset blandness. Tanjavur Subramaniam&#8217;s participation on rhythm was on acceptable decibels in a calculated way.
