VN.R. Prashant sang (Thyagaraja Sangeetha Sabha) accompanied by H.K. Narasimhamurthy (violin), Kanchana Eshwara Bhat (mridanga) and Shashishankar (mridanga) at Mysore recently.Remarkable gamut, deep resonant graces, effected in measured paces and gaits, collectively imparted the needed dignity to his presentations.A fine blend of scholarship and tradition illustrated the spirit of antiquity, carrying the audience to the days of the composers of yore, who enjoyed the credit of high wisdom, spirituality and sound insight.Take for example &#8220;Karikalabha Mukham&#8221; (Saveri- Dikshithar) wherein he thoroughly integrated and harmonised all the principal elements: alapana, lyrics and swarakalpana.An emphatic beginning of alapana in the tarasthayi carried with it those ineffable vibrations, which threw broad hints of what was to follow.Diction rendered the meanings and significance of the Sanskrit composition easily comprehendible; and pleasing gamakas elevated the musical experience.The general mood of the composition extended into the swarakalpana section too. An ideal tempo enabled the audience to enjoy the presentation in its entirety.Shyamashastri's &#8220;Ninuvinaga&#8221; (Purvikalyani) elicited similar observations - a convincing elaboration of the raga, appealing narration of the main lyrics, a meaningful expansion of the lyrics (&#8220;Paramalobhulanu&#8221;) and neatly woven passages of kalpanaswaras.H.K. Narasimha Murthy complemented both the vocal resonance and invigorating style of the singer, and the percussionists closely followed the lyrics to give further lift to their imports.&#8220;Karunimpa Idi&#8221; (Varna-Shahana-Veena Kuppayya), &#8220;Bagayanayya&#8221; (Chandrajyoti-Thygaraja), &#8220;Gowrishaaya&#8221; (Arabhi-Dikshithar), &#8220;Aarabhimanam&#8221; (Ragamalika-Ramaswamy Pillai/Talangapadi Panchanada Iyer) constituted other highlights.***Neyveli Santhanagopalan sang (Nadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha) accompanied by H.N. Bhaskar (violin), Neyveli B. Venkatesh (mridanga) and Sukanya Ramgopal (ghata).Veena Kuppayya's Varna, &#8220;Intachalamu&#8221; (Begade) followed by Swathi Thirunal's &#8220;Deva Deva Kalayami&#8221; (Mayamalavagoula) provided sufficient grounds to prefigure an overall success.The deep akaaras denoted the mettle of the artiste, and grit with which he executed them, rendered the progressions sprightly. In addition, those akaaras which bore in them strong taanic traits imparted the necessary energy to the articulations.Such exceptional features had their own drawbacks: they perceptibly undermined smoothness indispensable for any honest attempt to elaborate a raga like Purvikalyani (&#8220;Meenakshi&#8221; - Dikshithar). As a result, the general clarity of the lyrics also suffered.On similar grounds, elaboration of &#8220;Jaatarupa Nibhachela&#8221; (&#8220;Deva Deva Kalayami&#8221;) was at variance with the composer's sublime vision and spiritual depth. Instead of strengthening an introspective mood, the progressions merely highlighted the singer's vocal competence and virtuosity. Swarakalpana too followed the same digression unawares.Inspite of such shortcomings, the accomplished singer captivated the audience with his involvement and genuine concern to expose the essence of music. Observe the dignified airs that emerged from &#8220;Marivere&#8221; (Anandabhairavi-Shyamashastri), &#8220;Baalagopala&#8221; (Bhairavi-Dikshithar), and &#8220;Raja Raja Rajithe&#8221; (Niroshta-Muthayya Bhagavathar).Bhaskar's movements paralleled with the lead artiste's vocal abilities, Venakatesh's feather-touch beats retained resonance and fineness irrespective of any speed or intricacy and Sukanya Ramgopal's competence enhanced the rhythm fervour.The singer has the rare quality of appreciating the accompanists' creativity wholeheartedly. Whoever enjoys such a musical ambience would long fervidly to enjoy it again and again.
