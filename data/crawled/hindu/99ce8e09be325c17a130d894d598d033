VAarabhi, the centre for performing arts, an exclusive Violin school in Hyderabad (perhaps one of its kind in India), was started by the accomplished violinist Ashok Gurjale of Hyderabad.The school, established in 1998 in a very modest way grew into a vibrant institution in the next ten years. The students of Aarabhi are now well known for their stage shows; they have performed more than 200 live shows in India and abroad. The age group of the students lies between 6 and 20. Many of their compositions have won awards.Recently the institution celebrated its tenth anniversary at Lalitha Kala Thoranam Public gardens, Hyderabad.A  composition titledTamasoma Jyotirgamaya, was performed by an orchestra of 100 violinists and 12 other accompanists, dedicated to peace.The show began with an audio-visual presentation on the journey of Aarabhi .The invocation songPahi Pahi Gajanana in Sindhu Bhairaviwas followed by a Varnam in Raga Natakuranji. Panchratnakriti, Endaro Mahanu Bhavulu, was the next item presented, followed by the theme of the evening in Raga Hamsanandi, while footage of the various blasts in the country was shown on the screen. The message for world peace and saving our country was announced with a composition based on Harikhamboji, Keeravani and Brindavaniraag.Any orchestra needs perfect synchronisation, which unfortunately was lacking. The bows of the violin didn&#8217;t synchronise enough for it to be called a violin symphony. Some of the artistes were off key and the sound system was pathetic. It was  more din than the pleasantness of the instrument. The accompaniments like the base guitar and the key-board were not audible. The flautist was not in tune . The rhythm section was loud and at times missed the beat.The compere of the show  made lots of slip ups related to the jargon and otherwise.  Irrespective of the lapses, the show is commendable as it is not easy to control an orchestra of this nature. The interest the children showed to learn classical music should be appreciated.The theme was apt as it empathised with the recent tragedy in Mumbai. The Hyderabad audience, as usual, was busy chatting and talking on their mobile phones while their own children were performing.Apart form the concert, the organisation also honoured veteran violinist, Annavarapu Ramaswamy. Well-known classical singer Nookala Chinna Satyanarayana graced the occasion.
