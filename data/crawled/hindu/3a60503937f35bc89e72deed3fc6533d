VS. SIVAKUMARVidya Kalyanaraman, featured in the HCL concert series held at Kasturi Srinivasan Hall (Music Academy Mini Hall).The series sought to salute the excellence in human endeavour. Vidya&#8217;s musical upbringing and moulding influences seem to have run her in good stead as her alapana for Sankarabharanam (&#8216;Saroja Dala Nethri,&#8217; Syama Sastri) in its initial stages was an intuitive recreation of beauty.It was also gratifying to hear a virutham (Sendhanai Kandhanai) with a switch of ragas (Hamsanandhi, Kapi and Kalyanavasantham) achieved seamlessly towards the end of the concert.Her other songs at this concert were &#8216;Nannubrova&#8217; (Abhogi, Tyagaraja), &#8216;Seshachala Nayakam&#8217; (Varali, Dikshitar), &#8216;Endraiku Siva Krupai&#8217; (Mukhari, Neelakanta Sivan) and &#8216;Paramapurusham&#8217; (Lalitha Panchamam, Swati Tirunal), a redeeming pointer to the ready fund of songs at the disposal of this youngster.Her raga alapana as she touched and extended beyond the &#8216;ga&#8217; on the higher octave seemed to have been overwrought and forcibly expressed.Ragul&#8217;s alapanas and swara answers on the violin, for Sankarabharanam and Varali spoke for themselves, expressing quality but the glowing flamboyance of his bow was never staged.Ananda Sharma on the mridangam had finely laced rhythmic patterns in store which were played in abundance during the thani and his accompanying style for the songs indicated that he would soon grow to become an artiste of repute.Bottom Template Starts
