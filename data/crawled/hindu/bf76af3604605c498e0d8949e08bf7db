VAfter the concert, Bhattacharya said he always tries to bring out fresh shades of well known ragas. &#8220;Bhairav, Yaman and Bhairavi are ragas, which have been played so many times by maestros for centuries and are still open to fresh treatment.&#8221;Bhattacharya received his taleem  (musical instruction) from his father Pandit Rabi Bhattacharya, Pandit Dulal Roy and finally from  Pandit Ravi Shankar. He is well recognised  for hisragadari&#8212; feel for melody &#8212;as well aslayakari(mathematical calculations) and plays music that touches the soul.   One might disagree with his manner of approaching the sam (summation point of the tala cycle), which some would say is not classical, but one is forced to admire his calculations as he plays with the matras.It is considered nearly impossible to play embellishments such as kana (fleeting notes) and meend (glides) on a santoor. But being a keen disciple of Pandit Ravi Shankar, Bhattacharya has learnt how to create these grace notes.In his recital, he established thepakad(the phrase or note pattern that defines a raga) of Yaman, Ni Re Ga Re Sa, Pa Ma Ga Re Sa,  beautifully  using only three prominent notes of the raga.  &#8220;I like to establish a raga like Yaman within one or two notes which make the listener recognise the very essence of the raga,&#8221; he explained..It is vital for such an artiste to be accompanied by an equally sensitive tabla player.  In this case, Ram Kumar Mishra  kept brilliant pace with his combinations and permutations.Ram Kumar is the maternal grandson of Pandit Anokhelal Mishra and the son of Pandit Chhannulal Mishra.   At every sam of his Jhap tala,  it seemed as if the last beat of his tihai were hugging the last note of the santoor affectionately.  His balance of the tabla and bayan is also good.  He controlled  the fast pace of the Na Dhin Dhin Na bols whenever required, yet ensured their individual sound resonated.
