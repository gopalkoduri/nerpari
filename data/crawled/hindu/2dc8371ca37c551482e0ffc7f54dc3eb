VMuneer Khatoon Begum of Allahabad entertained a large gathering at the Hamdard University this past week with a programme of ghazals organised by its Archives and Research Centre. She is 75 but still retains traces of beauty.Born into a family of musicians in Allahabad, she learnt classical and semi classical music from masters like Behary Waheed Khan, Ustad Ghafoor Khan and Ustad Habeeb Khan. Besides she is a poet, who writes both in Persian and Urdu and also sings her compositions to the heart's delight.To the accompaniment of the sarangi, harmonium, tanpura and tabla, Begum rendered both classical and modern ghazals, including those of Ghalib, Faiz, Siraj Lucknawi, Majaz and Qadeer Lucknawi. In keeping with the delights of the monsoon season, she started off with a Malhar that intoxicated the listeners.Later she sang a ghazal of Faiz in her chiselled voice, which brought encores  -   "Kab hui khatam raat yaad nahin/ Kya hui unse baat yaad nahin" (When the night ended, I don't remember/ what I spoke to the beloved, I don't remember).Next she sang a ghazal of Siraj Lucknavi "Maddad-e-khayal ai mazi/ Zara aina uthana/ Mai badal gaya hoon khudi/ Ke badal gaya zamana. (Help, O bygone memories/ just hand over the mirror/ have I changed myself/ Or has the world changed?).It was followed by "Saqi pe ilzam na aiye/ Chahe mujh tak jam na aiye" (Do not blame the cup-bearer even if the wine-cup doesn't reach me).The lines had the audience, which included the chief guest Dr. S.M. Hashim, Chairman of the UPSC, swooning.R.V. SMITHBottom Template Starts
