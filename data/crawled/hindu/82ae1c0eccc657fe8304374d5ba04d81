VG. JAYAKUMARViolin maestro Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan cast a spell onrasikasas the curtain came down on  the 75-day Soorya Dance and Music Festival 2006.Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan began his 90-minute concert with Muthuswamy Dikshitar's kriti `Vatapi Ganapathim Bhajeham' in Hamsadwani, a mangala raga set to Adi talam. Swati Tirunal's composition `Krupaya Palaya Shoure' was preceded by a smooth delineation of the raga Charukesi. The kriti was set to Misra chappu talam.Next to follow was the evergreen `Nagumomu' of Tyagaraja in Abheri, set to Adi talam. Listeners were wonder struck seeing the veteran artiste plucking the strings and tapping lightly on the violin with his fingers without using the bow and thereby producing enchanting music. Different moods were created through his facial expressions.Abheri was followed by devotionals such as `Venkatesa suprabhatham,' `Shingara velane' and the signature tune of Akashvani. Only a few musicians of his stature can move so gracefully from one form of music to the other.Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan's penchant for filmy music is well known. He has composed music for 64 films in different languages, including racy music for a Tamil movie, `Menaattu marumakal.'Film songs tooIn this concert, he played some film songs such as `Sankara' (`Sankarabharanam'), `Malarku malarakum' (`Pasha Malar'), `Manasa maine varu' (`Chemmeen'), `Chuttam vida,' `Aa jare pardesi' and so on.  He concluded his recital by playing the national anthem. Accompanying him were M. Ganapati on the mridangam, R. Kalyana Raman on the ghatam and Srinivasa Rao on the tabla.Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan was honoured with a memento by Uthradam Tirunal Marthanda Varma.Bottom Template Starts
