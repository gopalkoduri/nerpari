VIt was music to the ears as Niza Azeezi sang lines of  poetry at a ghazal concert at Town Hall, Thrissur. The programme was noteworthy as her selections included popular Hindi, Urdu and Malayalam numbers.A native of Tirur in Malappuram district, Niza is a graduate in Carnatic music from Chembai Memorial Government Music College, Palakkad.A devotee of Hindustani music, she underwent rigorous training  under a host of distinguished gurus. Ustad Faiyaz Ahmed Khan of Indore Gharana is her current teacher.Niza began the concert with &#8216;Guru bine kaise gune gave,&#8217; a chota khyal in teen taaal. The song was a tribute to her gurus. Both the selection of the numbers and their ragas were proof  of Niza&#8217;s  propriety.This was followed by a composition &#8216;Majnun ne&#8217; by renowned lyricist Allama Mohammed Iqbal. The celebrated love story of  Lailu-Majnum was evocatively sung  by the singer.  The orchestration of the piece by Ustad Faiyaz Khan was excellent.Pakistani musician Farida Khan&#8217;s &#8216;Mohabath karnevale kam nahi honge&#8217; sang about  how no one is infallible to love. Scored in Tilak Kamod raga, the rendition was haunting. &#8216;Fir mujhe dee daye,&#8217; a composition of Mirza Galib in Jinjoti raga, was laced with Sufi philosophy.The concert included a couple of songs by  Pakistani exponent Munni Begam, namely &#8216;Thoda sa muskurathe nihagi milaayiye&#8217; and &#8216;Ye ishk hamem barbaad na kar.&#8217;Vocal support for the musician came from her brother Emam Azeezi. He too sang a few numbers including a Malayalam ghazal penned by O. N. V. Kurup and sung by Umbai, &#8216;Paaduka Saigal paaduka.&#8217;Hamsa Harsh on the harmonium, Mujib Rahman on the tabla and Akbar Mohammadi on the dolak provided good musical accompaniment.  The concert was organised by Bharatham.
