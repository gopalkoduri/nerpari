VNot for the first time, the maestro has chosen a new platform to reach out to the masses. Ram dhun, Krishna bhajans, Shiv dhun&#8230;he has sung them all. Jagjit Singh&#8217;s latest offering is &#8216;Guru Manyo Granth,&#8217; a special edition of four CDs featuring 32 shabads.He is obviously pleased with his effort.&#8220;The style is new yet traditional. I have given the shabad-singing a modern touch because I couldn&#8217;t get artistes to play the old instruments. But I am proud to be associated with this album,&#8221; says a cheerful Jagjit.It is not the first time that Jagjit has sung shabads. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been singing them since childhood. This time I&#8217;ve tried to follow the guidelines that were given to me and I&#8217;m happy the effort has come out well.&#8221;The album, formally launched in Nanded, has been released by Tips Industries Limited.This special edition has been produced to commemorate 300 years of Gurta Gaddi of Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji Maharaj. It is a captivating collection of hymns of gurus and saints, Sufis and bhats, covering a period of six centuries.Apart from Jagjit, some of the artistes who have sung are Begum Parveen Sultana, Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty, Ustad Rashid Khan, Anup Jalota, Suresh Waadkar, Hariharan, Sonu Nigam, Shankar Mahadevan, Hansraj Hans, Shafaqat Amanat Ali, Dilraj Kaur, Ashwini Deshpande, Jayshree Shivram and Juhi Chawla.Why Juhi Chawla? &#8220;Well, she is learning music and we have to look at the commercial interests too. After all, we need to sell the album,&#8221; he quips.On a serious note, Jagjit observes, &#8220;I&#8217;ve worked on this album for close to one year. It is one of the many devotional projects I have on hand. The selections are from hymns by non-Sikh saints also. The 32 shabads are a symbol of national integration. We have many non-Sikh singers making their contribution. Not one of them demanded money for the project.&#8221;Jagjit stresses that the bhakti in this album is very pronounced.He is willing to take a few questions other than this project and talk about the singers in the talent shows on television.&#8220;It is sad that most of them want to become stars overnight. And they only sing film music. You can&#8217;t become a quality singer by aping others. We also don&#8217;t have filmmakers who want quality music.&#8221;How to attract the youngsters to classical singing then? &#8220;It has to come from within. These youngsters look for short cuts and instant stardom. These talent shows are only drama where the judges are just show pieces.&#8221;Jagjit parts with some good news for those who love devotional music. He is ready with albums on Gayatri Mantra and Mahamritunjay Mantra. No more ghazals then? &#8220;Next month, a 12-ghazal tribute, all new.&#8221;
