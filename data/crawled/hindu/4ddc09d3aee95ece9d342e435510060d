VYuvadhwani is a platform exclusively for young, upcoming artistes who deserve due exposure and encouragement. In pursuance of the lofty objective, the organisation conducted three-day Yuvasangeethotsava hosting several vocal and instrumental concerts including slots reserved for percussionists. Senior artistes of high repute were invited as observers.On the inaugural day, Udayakiran sang accompanied by Sangeetha (violin) and P.S. Shridhar (mridanga). The singer, with his resonating deep voice perfectly aligning with the shruthi, commenced the recital with Veena Venkatagiriyappa's &#8220;Vanajaksha&#8221; (varna) in &#8220;Vedandagamana&#8221; (Gambhiranata).Even a brief alapana in &#8220;Naasamani&#8221; (a vivadi mela), established the artiste's commitment which has bloomed into competence; Dikshitar's &#8220;Shri Rama Saraswathi&#8221;, further strengthened the above argument.With the same pleasing progression, the presented Thyagaraja's &#8220;Enthanuchu Sairintunu&#8221; in Yadukula Kamboji. The singer's involvement, measured pace and clarity in reciting the lyrics amply favored the sentimental aspects nested in both the composition and the raga.The audience could enjoy more elaborations in Keeravani in matters of varieties of gamakas and sancharas astutely followed in every respect by the violinist. Likewise, the lyrics, &#8220;Brovu Brovu&#8221; of Shyama Shastri infused with the sentiment of intense submission flourished much more with the added support of the rhythm accompanist who followed the lyrical accentuations with care.***Vamshidhar's flute recital displayed effluence of artistry and scholarship, enwrapped within the folds of carefully and punctiliously carved aesthetic sense. Scholarly merits he has imbibed have deeply ingrained in his musical faculties; and this fact is unequivocally established by the consistently and consecutively maintained standards of classicism and tradition in any of his concerts.Far from any inclination to pledge his style to short living flashy maneuverings, Vamshidhar takes refuge in simplicity and majesty, which have far-reaching advantages in transporting a serious listener into long lasting realms of repose, where soft melody reins and sublime sentiments nestle.&#8220;Himadrisuthe&#8221; (Kalyani - Shyamashastri) served as an illustrative sample confirming his proficiency over the art form. The alapana had methodical sancharas (every movement revealing the beauty of the raga) with fine gamakas (variety of them suiting those sancharas in their various levels of evolvement). Vamshidhar dexterously manages with one flute to bring out all subtleties into realisation, be it any octave he chooses to traverse in order to consummate his extempore.The lyrical section creamed off the desired meaning further enhanced by the neraval (at the charana &#8211; &#8220;Shyamakrishna Sodari Gouri&#8221; ) and neatly framed kalpanaswaras - every stage being supplemented aptly by the seasoned violinist, Veena Suresh. Tani avarthana by Radhesh (mridanga) exemplified a growing proficiency rising to the delightful heights of maturity.&#8220;Maarubalka&#8221; (Shri Ranjani - Thyagaraja) was another number drawing all the attention of the audience: comprised a lively alapana, pleasing narration of the main body of the composition (with due consideration to the musical significance of the sangathis) and fluently drawn passages of swarakalpana (bearing relevance to the overall mood). Perhaps, a slower tempo would have done more justice to the lyrics of this grand kriti.
