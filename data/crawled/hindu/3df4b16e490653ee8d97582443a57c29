VYoung vocalist Bharat Sundar impressed listeners at Palghat Fine Arts Society, Palakkad, with a superb performance on Sunday. He established a good rapport with the audience from the start and sustained it till the end. Singing in his powerful voice, he gave ample proof of his good patanthara.In the company of stalwartsHe was in the company of stalwarts &#8211; M.A. Sundareswaran on the violin ,K.V.Prasad on the mridangam and Kovai Suresh on the ghatam.Beginning with the varnam &#8216;Indachalamu' in Begada, he proceeded to a brisk &#8216;Amba paradevathe' in Rudrapriya, a composition of Krishnaswamy Ayya. His pleasing alapana of Varali was true to tradition. Choosing the Muthuswamy Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Seshachala Nayakam,' he came out with a feisty neraval in the charanam. After a quick &#8216;Bhogeendra Saayinam' in Kuntalavarali, a composition of Swati Thirunal, he took up Bhairavi for in-depth exploration. The distinct fragrance of this enchanting raga emanated from his imaginative delineation. He concluded the recital with Papanaasam Sivan's &#8216;Karpagame' in Madhyamavathi, followed by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar's thillana in Poornachandrika.While he is quite at home with the technical aspects, Bharat would do well to infuse little more bhava into his music, which would make him a complete musician.M.A.Sundareswaran lived up to his reputation as a top class violinist. His raga versions and swaraprastharas were marked by tonal richness.K.V.Prasad revealed his maturity and a keen sense of anticipation in his mridangam accompaniment. He was ably supported by Kovai Suresh on the ghatam.
