VThis year&#8217;s celebration was special as three veteran musicians, Maharajapuram S. Ramachandran (vocal), Nagai R. Muralidharan (violin) and Vellore G. Ramabhadran (mridangam) were honoured with the title &#8216;Arsha Kala Bhushanam,&#8217; by the Swamiji.The award was accompanied by a citation and a cash prize. Swamiji pointed out that the term &#8216;Arsha&#8217; means &#8220;that which comes from the Rishis.&#8221; Besides the Vedas, &#8220;music, dance and theatre have also been received from the rishis and they are together, known as &#8216;Gandharva Veda.&#8217;  Swamiji said the title can have two meanings:  &#8220;One to whom arsha kala is a bhushanam (ornament); and one who is a bhushanam to arsha kala.&#8221;The function began with the recitation of the Vedas by the students of the gurukulam, and the Tamizh Tirumarai. Ravi Sam, founder trustee, Sruti Seva Trust, in his welcome speech, drew attention to the ashram&#8217;s role in bringing environmental awareness, the activities of &#8216;Aim for Seva&#8217; that helps the rural populace and the tribals without disturbing their identity, and the digital library consisting of nearly 10,000 manuscripts.Koviloor Madhadhipathi  Nachiappa Gnanadesikar spoke highly of the contribution of the gurukulam in keeping our rich culture alive. Chief guest Karumuthu T. Kannan, managing director, Thiyagarajar Mills, Madurai, drove home an important message &#8212; &#8220;Economic empowerment can give stability to a nation only if it is reinforced with knowledge  and character.&#8221; Swami Dayananda Saraswati stated that prayer alone can neutralise our helplessness and make us happy.Preceding the award-ceremony, Maharajapuram S. Ramachandran gave a vocal recital, accompanied by the other two awardees.He began with Dikshitar&#8217;s kriti in Mohanam, &#8216;Raktha Ganapathim Bhajeham&#8217;.He presented it with an absorbing niraval for &#8216;Sakala Kaaryaartha Sidhidam&#8217; that had interesting and intricate swaraprastaras. &#8216;Paahimaam Sri Rajarajeswari, Amba&#8217; in Nattai, by Shyama Sastri, was a rare feast. Ramachandran&#8217;s smooth delivery of Gopalakrishna Bharati&#8217;s &#8216;Saranaagatham Endru Nambi Vandhen&#8217; in Gowla was impressive.The centre piece, &#8216;Bhaavaye Paramaatmaanam&#8217; by Swami Dayananda Saraswati, was in Arabhi. Before concluding his brief concert with the familiar &#8216;Bho Shambho,&#8217; Ramachandran sang &#8216;Dayavodu Anandhamalikkum,&#8217; a ragamalika viruttam on Swamiji.Nagai Muralidharan&#8217;s mellifluous violin and Vellore Ramabhadran&#8217;s measured mridangam added to the enjoyment of the concert.
