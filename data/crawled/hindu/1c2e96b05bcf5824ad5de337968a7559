VFifty years is a long time, especially for an institution that exists for the sole purpose of propagation of our ancient fine arts. Such institutions are few and far between and Sri Bhaktha Ramadasu Government College of Music and Dance stands tall amongst them. Last weekend, it celebrated its 52nd Annual day besides its premises in Marredpally, Secunderabad.Starting with just 12 students in 1957, this government institution has grown to over 600 students today providing varied courses in Dance, Vocal and Instrumental Music. Many stalwarts like Nookala Chinna Satyanarayana, Nedunuri Krishnamurty, Srirangam Gopalarathnam have been its principals while its students today, have the good fortune of being taught by the likes of Peri Sriramamurthy, Pandurang Muthalik and Haripriya.The unique beauty of this institution is that it caters to a vibrant mixture of students &#8211; from the ubiquitous software professionals to the traditional lookingbhaghavathars, from youngsters to cheerful seniors, from jeans-clad todhotidecked, from the doe-eyed to the awe-struck &#8211; it has embraced all in its warmth.Such a colourful blend was seen recently in the fare presented by its students. The musical spectrum extended fromLambodaraandKamalajathalatoAnuragamulepreceded by a briefalapana. Lovely Hindustani numbers embellished the proceedings while the beautiful Bharatanatyam pieces brought up the rear of the events. The day aptly started off withGuru Binain the Hindustani style and smaller items presented by the junior students. Vocal and instrumental performances were interestingly interlaced just as were Hindustani and Carnatic pieces. Steadily the items grew in depth as did the seniority of the performers.The palpable enthusiasm of the participants was equally matched by the benign earnestness of the teachers.For many it was their first performance and it seemed that the teachers did not want to leave any student out of the festivities &#8211; and rightfully so.The sitar performance stood out in this very singular annual day.The programme ended with a special musical featureSwara archana, composed and directed by  B. Haripriya, where the children showed superb unison. In all, it was a very enjoyable evening filled with colour, costume, gaiety, exuberance, hard work and memories, reassuring us of the prospects of our Fine Arts.
