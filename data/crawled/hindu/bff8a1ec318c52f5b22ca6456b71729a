VSULOCHANA PATTABHIRAMANTatvaloka, a magazine published by Dakshinamnaya Sarada Peetam, Sringeri, organised a group-singing programme comprising compositions of the Sringeri Math  heads, Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati Maha Swamigal and Sri Sri Bharati Theertha Mahaswamigal, the 34th and 35th pontiffs of the Math  respectively.The songs in Sanskrit on the various Hindu deities were absolutely inspiring, proving the fact that Carnatic music has been elevated to such amazing heights mainly because of the creations of divine, saint poets and also the faith that salvation through music is the basic principle of our art.Praiseworthy concertThe singers, all trained with great discipline by vidwan V. Subrahmaniam, a prime sishya of Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, presented a praiseworthy concert that blended melody, lyrical clarity, harmony and synchronisation in ample measure. The seven  artistes &#151;  Meenakshi, Bhavana, Saraswathi, Srinidhi, Sarada, Chitra, Aparna and the singer Rajiv did their guru really proud.V. Subrahmaniam's impeccable adherence to the traditional values of Carnatic music was much in evidence in the choice of rakti ragas.Sensitive support was offered by  P. Vasant Kumar (veena), Koushik (flute), and Parthasarathi (mridangam).Bottom Template Starts
