VThe September Season of music and dance festival of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore, spread a variety fare this year too. While the top ranking artists adorned the stage during the main slot, young musicians and the experienced musicians who are ye\u000at to make it to the top, occupied the afternoon slot. The first afternoon vocal recital was by N.D. Vijayakumar, disciple of T.R. Balamani. He did not venture much into new grounds and stuck to the usual compositions which he rendered with good involvement. Nellai Ravindran&#8217;s violin was melodious and Tiruchi Aravind&#8217;s mridangam had pep.V. Deepika made a favourable impression on the rasikas with her rich voice, smooth presentation and a pleasing stage presence. One could recognise the strong influence of her guru Sudha Ragunathan in her rendition, but one hopes that with  experience she will develop a style of her own. Nellai Ravindran on the violin and Venkatasubramaniyan on the mridangam gave her a wonderful support.Sadhana Sadhan, an institution that conducts classes on spiritual literature in Coimbatore, made a group presentation on  Arunagirinathar&#8217;s Thiruppugazh led by Sundari Hariharan.  It was an effort of love. Those who sang were not great musicians, but they sang with involvement, well-aligned to sruti, consciously taking care to pronounce the words correctly and clearly.Ranganayaki Sachidanandam gave a wholesome concert choosing all her ragas ending with &#8216;Priya.&#8217; She began with &#8216;Siddhi Vinaayakam&#8217; in Shanmukhapriya and continued with &#8216;Mara Janani&#8217; (Natakapriya), &#8216;Pasupathi Priye Sathi&#8217; (Pasupathipriya), &#8216;Nada Nilai Kanduruga&#8217; (Gayakapriya), &#8216;Chakkaniraja Maarga&#8217;(Kharaharapriya) and &#8216;Jagajjanani&#8217;in Rathipathipriya.The vocal concert by Mythili Kannan, an &#8216;A&#8217; grade artist of AIR, Tiruchi,  was another fulfilling experience. Her delineation of Khambodi  was scintillating. The clarity of her voice and the heights it could reach were highly enjoyable. As a true disciple of Srivanchiyam Ramachandra Iyer, she proved that day that, an artiste could hold the interest of the audience just by being traditional. She was ably accompanied on the violin by Madurai D.Sachidanandam and on the mridangam by Madurai Thyagarajan.D. Sathyaprakash, an ardent disciple of Chandrasekara Bhagavathar, shows improvement year after year. This young man&#8217;s rich imagination could be seen in the raga delineation and swaraprastharas. His music touches the heart as he delivers the lyrics clearly with the right emotion. The poplular song &#8216;Unnaiyandri Utra Thunai Ulagil Yaaraiyyaa&#8217; in Bhavani by Dhandapani Desikar was particularly moving. Most of the songs he selected that day were rare. He sang Madurai Somu&#8217;s &#8216;Maathaa, Neeye&#8217; in Kalyani, &#8216;Needu Moortini Kanukoni&#8217; in Nattakurinji by Pallavi Gopala Iyer, &#8216;Parama Paavana raama&#8217; by Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar in Purvikalyani, &#8216;Paraashakthi Ishwari Jagajjanani&#8217; in Gowri Manohari by Dikshitar and a Thiruppugazh in Husseni. Senior artists, Palakad Swamiinathan on the violin and K.S Raghunath on the mridangam, gave good support.C. Sukanya, daughter and disciple of D.K. Jayaraman, Poornima Krishnan, disciple of Kovai Kannan Brothers, Sriranjani Santhanagopalan, daughter and disciple of Neyveli Santhanagopalan, R. Vaidhyanathan, disciple of P.S.Narayanaswami, Shilpa &amp; Sarga Murali, disciples of Shobana Krishnamurthy, Swathi Srikrishna, disciple of PSN and the Bombay Brothers (Ashwin and Anujan Krishnamoorthy) were the other vocalists who entertained the audience during the afternoon slot.Besides the vocal concerts, there was a flute recital by Sruthi Sagar, disciple of Balasai, which won excellent critical acclaim. Vidhyanadhi N.Iyer, disciple of N. Mahadevan gave a pleasing veena recital.
