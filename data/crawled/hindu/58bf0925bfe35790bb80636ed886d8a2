VThe main raga Thodi in his concert at the Asthika Samajam, Venus Colony, navigated though phrases of finesse, loaded karvais and careful glides piloted to present a splendid portrayal of Thodi.Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Sri Krishnam Bhaja Manasa&#8217; was in full elegance adding more lustre by niraval and swaras at the famous line &#8216;Sangu Chakra Gada&#8217;.The Sahana alapana and Tygaraja&#8217;s &#8216;E Vasuda&#8217; was a precise package with the raga alapana connected with delicate strands.Earlier, Ajay offered full measures of rapid fire swara segments one after the nirval at &#8216;Kala Muna Sobillu&#8217; in &#8216;Meru Samana&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla- Tyagaraja) and the other in &#8217;Parama purusham&#8217; (Lalitha Panajamam - Swati Tirunal) to sustain the spirit of the audience.Nevertheless, Ajay should keep a hold on speed as otherwise the swaras can end up either falling apart or turn into tame notes robbing the raga of its charm. For freshness, Namboodri introduced a composition of Dikshitar in the raga Manohari &#8216;Sankarabhirami Manoharam&#8217; and &#8216;Mara Vairi Ramani&#8217; in Nasikabooshani by Tyagaraja.The concluding part was breezy with lightweights like Jonpuri (&#8216;Rama Mantrava Jabiso&#8217;) and Behag (&#8216;Irakkam Varamal Ponadenna&#8217;).Anayampatti Venkatasubramanian on the violin infused pep in his versions of Sahana, Thodi and kalpanaswaras marching in line with the vocalist. B. Sivaraman and N. Guruprasad were willing and active partners on mridangam and ghatam in the competent team work.
