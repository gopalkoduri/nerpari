VFor the &#8216;able-bodied&#8217; music buffs of Vijayawada, it was athought-provoking evening as they witnessed a moving performance by a group of visually challenged singers at Siddhartha Auditorium on Sunday. The talented musicians drove home the point that their handicap is not a curse and can be overcome with commitment and determination.The programme, aptly namedBlackby organiser Abhinetra Integrated School for the Blind, brought to the forefront the in-born singing qualities in them, which were in no way inferior to that of professionals. Be it devotional, romantic or foot-tapping songs, the singers excelled in all genres with ease.However, the pick of the singers was Dora Babu who renderedMathrudevobhato perfection. The song, which moved many hearts, saw many wiping their moist eyes. Karthick, Uma, Shyamala, Rajesh, Satyanarayana and Rani pitched in enthusiastically, crooning songs such asJaya Jaya Vinayaka,Sai Divya Roopam,Bale Manchi RojuandNuvvosthanantemuch to the delight of the audience. Prakash on the keyboard was brilliant, hardly playing a discordant note while playing the intricate interludes.&#8220;All the singers listen to the songs and learn to sing,&#8221; said Sankar, the conductor of the concert. &#8220;Their astonishing memory power is nature&#8217;s gift.&#8221;Many music enthusiasts came forward voluntarily to render a helping hand to them. The employees of the South Central Railway, Vijayawada Division, donated Rs. 10,000, while Akshara International School&#8217;s principal, Sarada Anil Kumar, also donated Rs. 10,000. Many dropped their contributions in the box kept on the stage.Mayor M.V. Ratna Bindu, who attended the programme as chief guest, said that many lessons could be learnt from these &#8220;children of lesser gods&#8221; as they seldom considered their disability a hurdle. &#8220;I want to request all the television channels to encourage these special singers by conducting programmes, which can instil confidence in them,&#8221; she said.The mayor also promised to make efforts to allot a site for the construction of a school for the deprived children. Lions International G.V. Prasad came forward to take up the responsibility of constructing a building for them on the site.
