V&#8220;Amul Chhote Ustaad &#8212; Do Deshon Ki Ek Awaaz&#8221; on Star Plus is going to present the best of young Pakistani talent to the Indian viewers. There are 10 children from Pakistan trying their luck in the show. All of them have been handpicked by the redoubtable Rahat Fateh Ali Khan who feels the youngsters will give a good account of their talent on the show.The kids, all in the age group of eight to 14, hailing from Karachi, Lahore and Faisalabad, etc. to share Rahat's confidence. They have their own other likings according to their age. Karachi-based Wania Jibraan, a class 8 student, says, &#8220;In Karachi we have more promotional shows than reality shows, and this is a very good platform to show our talent. I have taken part in many shows back home and even won the International Schools Educational Olympiad for singing, but this is going to be more exciting.&#8221;Wania, a daughter of doctor parents, wants to become a cardiologist. She adds, &#8220;Music is very important to me but education is even more important and for me an educated musician is much better.&#8221; Like any other Pakistani, Wania loves watching Indian movies. Shahid Kapoor and Deepika Padukone are her favourites.Fariha Akram, an 11-year-old from Faisalabad, started singing at the age of four, training under her vocalist father. This is the little girl's third visit to India. Last year she was invited to perform in Pune on Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Syed Mair Hassan, a class 9 student from Karachi, says, &#8220;I never got any formal training for music; I just like to hear Indian and Pakistani songs and sing them on my own.&#8221; Singing is not the only passion for these little ustads. Fariha is a good cook and can stitch clothes, while Mair says, &#8220;My other hobby is freestyle wrestling. I am a huge follower of WWE. I can lift a man twice my weight.&#8221;The three KhansThey may have learnt from different ustads, but they are united by their love and appreciation of India, particularly Mumbai. All of them have one voice: that Mumbai is almost like Karachi &#8212; the food, the people, the language, the clothes, everything is just like we have in Karachi, they say. The only difference is the traffic which is too much here in Mumbai, they add. As for the other big difference, &#8220;The three Khans (Shah Rukh, Aamir, Salman) live here!&#8221;On the show, they will form teams with their Indian counterparts. As Sonu Nigam puts it, &#8220;Every team will have one Indian and one Pakistani singer; no one can say, because of our nationality we got fewer votes.&#8221; Omi Vaidya (who played Chatur Ramalingam in the Bollywood blockbuster &#8220;3 idiots&#8221;) will host the show. Rahat adds, &#8220;Unlike other reality shows, you will not find me and Sonu fighting on the show.&#8221; The show starts this Saturday and will last for 12 weeks.
