VFor the third year in succession Bangalore Kidney Foundation brings to Bangalore doyens of Hindustani Classical Music as part of its annual fundraiser festival Dhwani. Dhwani was born in 2004 during an informal chat between Pt. Rajshekar Mansur and the chairman of BKF Dr. P. Sriram and trustee P. Srinivas, as they recalled the association BKF had with Pt. Mallikarjun Mansur.In 1991 Pt. Mallikarjun Mansur, the renowned artiste of the Atrauli Gharana was brought from Dharwad to the BKF Chande Hospital in a critical condition.With the treatment BKF provided Pt. Mansur he was cured of his ailment. As a mark of generosity Pt. Mallikarjun Mansur performed a free concert for BKF as fundraiser.BKF is a charitable trust that was established way back in 1979 when there was no succour for kidney disease patients in Karnataka. A group of non-medical professionals took it upon themselves to bring renal care into Karnataka. Having pioneered many firsts in Karnataka such as the first dialysis centre, the first kidney transplant, the first rural dialysis centre and others, BKF decided to expand its scope as it entered its 25th year in 2004. That was the context of Dhwani's birth. With the money they raise through these programmes they intend to extend free dialysis to more people.BKF volunteered to institute an award in memory and in honour of Pt. Mallikarjun Mansur. Each year an award is being presented to an outstanding artiste selected by the organising committee. The award constitutes a bust of Pt. Mallikarjun Mansur, a citation and Rs. 50,0000. Dhwani 2006 comes to south Bangalore for the first time. The event will be held on September 16 and 17 at JSS Auditorium, Kanakapura Road, Jayanagar. On Saturday, September 16, Gundecha Brothers perform followed by Vasundhara Komkallimath. She is also the recipient of the BKF Mallikarjun Mansur outstanding artiste of the year. This will be followed on Sunday morning by a performance by Pt. Venkatesh Kumar and violin virtuoso N. Rajam. On Sunday evening Pt. Rajshekar Mansur and Pt. Vishwa Mohan Bhat will perform.The organisers have kept the price of the tickets nominal at Rs. 49. Contact Guruprasad at 080-26662991 or 98454 24053 for enquiries.
