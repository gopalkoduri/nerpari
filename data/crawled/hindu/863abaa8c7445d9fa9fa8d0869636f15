VKalavathi Avadhoot sang at Ganabharathi in Mysore accompanied by Veena Suresh (violin), H.L. Shivashankaraswamy (mridanga) and Karthik (khanjira). The concert displayed many laudable features from the point of view of tradition, proportion and experience. The singer fulfilled the very objective of classical music as Thyagaraja has pointed out, devotion in a methodical and aesthetic fashion.Moreover, she had taken care to keep her personal charisma subservient to the main objective, so that her musical modesty could satiate the audience fully. Having control over both shruthi and laya, which always complemented melody rather than mathematical intricacies or labyrinthine articulations, the singer started her concert with Patnam's &#8220;Eranapai Inta Chouka&#8221; (Todi) in two speeds, treating it with clarity and compactness. On similar desirable planes stood &#8220;Vallabhanayakasya&#8221; (Begade-Dikshithar), &#8220;Guruleka Etuvanti&#8221; (Gourimanohari) and &#8220;Tappulanniyu&#8221; (Bhowli - Muthayya Bhagavathar). Whereas, neatly woven kalpanaswaras harmonised with the grandeur the Sanskrit lyrics imparted to &#8220;Vallabhanayakasya&#8221;, an equally impressive neraval at the charana, &#8220;Tattvabodhanajesi Kaapaadu&#8221; in &#8220;Guruleka Etuvanti&#8221;, demonstrated an overall consistency.The violinist's melodic airs elevated the concert to gentle climaxes. Fine gamakas and refined vocal expressions enriched the lyrics in &#8220;Kamakshi Amba&#8221; (Anandabhairavi -Shyamashastri) and &#8220;Ni Irangai Enil&#8221; (Athana-Papanasam Sivan), rendering them emotive, absorbing. Kalavathi devoted sufficient time to beautify the composition &#8220;Enduku Peddala&#8221; (Shankarabharana- Thyagaraja) at the level of both neraval (&#8220;Vedashastrarthamu&#8221;) and kalpanaswaras treading an ideal slow tempo so that the audience had every opportunity to enjoy both the rasa of the raga and the artha of the sahithya.The percussionists' beats, soft and soporific, favoured the lead artiste's soft intonations and inflections. &#8220;Smaraneyonde Saalade&#8221; (Malayamarutha-Purandaradasa), &#8220;Aariddarenayya&#8221; (Tilang-Purandaradasa), &#8220;Kurai Onru&#8221; (Ragamalika-Rajaji) and Tillana (Behag-Balamuralikrishna) were other inclusions. In Behag, apt stress on characteristic of the raga around the swara cluster - pratimadhyama, antharagandhara and shuddha madhyama, could have made presentation more acceptable and inspiring.All the compositions emerged directly from her memory, and this furnished the artiste with a distinct advantage of unhindered fluency in the flow of mood and the meanings.* * *Bharathi Stree Samaja is conducting a series of Ramanavami concerts focusing on projecting the artistes who are on the verge of entering into an arena of wider popularity.Geetha Putty presented her concert on the second day entertaining the audience and convinced them of her potentials. Madhusudan (violin), V.S. Ramesh (mridanga) accompanied her fortifying the efforts.&#8220;Vanajakshiro&#8221; (Kalyani-Poochi Shrinivasa Iyengar) in two speeds in strict conformity with rhythm provided the necessary impetus to the concert. The singer's imaginative elaborations drew warm applauses from the audience. This was particularly so when she was expatiating the ragas on hand. Take for example Dharmavati, which preceded Vasudevachar's &#8220;Bhajana Seyarada&#8221;. Her voice endowed with appreciable resilience and melody, traversed the octaves with ease, and the subtle graces highlighted the essence of the raga. Nevertheless, swarakalpana that followed the main text, though fluent, could not convince as far as the spontaneity was concerned.The concert included &#8220;Bagayanayya&#8221; (Chandrajyothi-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Kamalapthakula&#8221; (Brindavanasaranga) and so on.V.
