VT.N. Krishnan&#8217;s recital answered the question - is music all about technique and skill or some elusive factor that takes it to sublime levels?Playing with his son Sriram and daughter Viji, Krishnan&#8217;s creativity  while using the bow and fingers was  articulated beautifully.The precision and arrangement of phrasings in the alapanas, shared among the three, brought out the difference between playing competently and scaling great heights.Sriram was given independent charge of Varali. The tara sthayi picturisation was a shining exercise in refined exposition. Though young, his vision of the raga&#8217;s shades helped him look beyond the scales. Motivation in that direction, now and then guided by Krishnan, led to compulsive attention to bhakti aspects.Krishnan&#8217;s strokes of Saveri (ragam, tanam and pallavi) were finely balanced, and intensely elegant. The nuances he introduced into the delineation were noteworthy. It was a clear statement of his status and style. The raga and ragamalika tanam by all the three were oriented towards peak appeal with the fundamentals of tanam techniques in place.The kirtana part included &#8216;Evarani&#8217; (Devamritavarshini), &#8216;Seshachala Naayakam&#8217; (Varali) and &#8216;Maarubalka&#8217; (Sriranjani). The kirtana interpretation had highly attractive styling and was exceptionally versatile.Tiruvarur Bhaktavatsalam, as is his wont in accompanying Krishnan, was decibel conscious. So was Vaikom Gopalakrishnan on the ghatam.
