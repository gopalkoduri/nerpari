VMinnal Kodi Compositions of Ambujam KrishnaRajalakshmi AudioSumitra-SunandaAudio CD &#8211; Carnatic &#8211; Price: Rs.100The compositions of the late Ambujam Krishna have been set to music by several stalwarts who had adorned the Carnatic music arena for several decades.The untuned compositions of the composer are still being set to music by those who have access to the songs.Anantalakshmi Sadagopan, a senior vocalist, has set to tune a number of Ambujam Krishna&#8217;s creations. Her grand daughters, Sumitra and Sunanda, have rendered seven  compositions musically shaped by her in this compact disc.A bright composition on the Goddess of fine arts is set to Mayamalavagowla and is a good opening number.This song has gained popularity amidst select leading female Carnatic vocalists of the present times. &#8216;Kodandapani&#8217; (Valaji), &#8216;Varavenum&#8217; (Simhendramadhyamam), &#8216;Minnal Kodiyo&#8217; (Ragamalika), &#8216;Ennai Kaividal&#8217; (Varamu) are the compositions which follow.The singers do well to just render the songs without any niraval or swara passages giving importance to just the lyrics and music.A brief vinyasa of Purvikalyani by Sumitra is ear-friendly.The violinist Kalpana Kishore renders a pleasing version of the raga as well.The song succeeding the alapana is &#8216;En Azhaganai&#8217; and portrays the Bhakti element in the composition.The closing number is very appealing and is a ragamalika tuned in Durga, Bahaar, Suddha Sarang and Surutti. This composition &#8216;Kannan Endradhume,&#8217; used to be rendered in a single raga by the late M.L. Vasanthakumari.Good anticipatory percussive support has been provided by J. Vaidhyanathan on the mridangam and S. Karthik on the ghatam.
