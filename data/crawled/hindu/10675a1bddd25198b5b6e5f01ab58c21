VT .M. Krishna's vocal recital at Velayudhaswamy Thirumana Mandapam, Tiruppur, was another jewel in his crown. He began with &#8216;Appan Avatharitha Kathaamrutham' in Kharaharapriya and the shower of swaras that flowed at the end of it engulfed the hall.Harikesanallur Muthaiah Bhagavatar's &#8216;Mathe, Malayadhwaja Pandya Sanjaathe' followed in regal majesty with its enchanting chittaswaras.Krishna certainly believes in surprising his audience. When he began the alapana in Bilahari, the rasikas wondered which kriti he would present. But suddenly he switched over to Bhairavi. As one was wondering what he was up to, he strayed into Sama and then to Vasantha. The cheerful applause was spontaneous when he began Bharatiar's &#8216;Suttum Vizhi Sudarthaan Kannamma' as a ragamalika set in these four ragas.The main piece was the lyrically rich &#8216;Kaana Kann Kodi Vendum' in Khambodi by Papanasam Sivan. As Krishna started etching the raga with the choicest phrases, its swaroopa emerged slowly and when he completed his alapana, the raga was there in all its glory, stately and dignified. But at the fingers of R.K. Sriram Kumar on the violin, the raga had a totally different character &#8211; coy and soft. A torrential rain of swaras preceded the awe-inspiring thani. Tiruchi Sankaran wove different patterns of laya winning applause each time he finished a round and Guruprasad on his ghatam vindicated himself commendably by meeting Sankaran's challenges with alacrity.Delectable farePriya Sisters, Shanmukhapriya and Haripriya, presented a lively and delectable fare with a judicious blend of the traditional and the modern. Their delineation of Sahana (&#8216;Chittam Irangathathenayya'), Shanmukhapriya, (&#8216;Saravanabhava Enum') and Mohanam (&#8216;Nannu Palimpa') provided absolute satisfaction to the connoisseurs. &#8216;Sriranganatha Guru Sevai Kaana,' &#8216;Malai Meedhu Vaazhum Sri Srinivasa' and &#8216;Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaaya' took care of the lighter session. B. Raghavendra Rao on the violin, Delhi Sairam on the mridangam and B.S. Purushottaman on the ghatam formed a great team.O.S. Arun's abhangs and bhajans and their lilting rhythms made the audience sway.The Odissi recital by the students of Guru Pitambar Biswal was very pleasing to the eyes with their lovely hairdos, colourful costumes, statuesque formations and melodious music.&#8216;Isai Amudham' 2010 also featured up-and-coming artists preceding the main slot. Niranjani Anand proved to be a promising veena artist. With a little more hard work, she can certainly win a place for herself in the minds of rasikas.
