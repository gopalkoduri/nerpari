VMambalam sisters, R.Vijayalakshmi and R. Chithra, made a favourable impression on the audience with their pleasing vocal concert, organised under the aegis of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts at GKD Auditorium, Coimbatore. Their gurus, B.V. Raman and B.V. Lakshmanan, had laid a strong musical foundation and, later, Suguna Varadhachari polished it to a sparkle.Their neat delineation of the ragas, elaborate niravals and imaginative swaraprastaras were proof of their creativity and diligent practice. They began with the varnam, &#8216;Karunimpa' in Sahana by Tiruvottriyur Thyagayyar. &#8216;Raama, Dayajoodave' by Badrachala Ramadasar was presented after a lovely delineation of Dhanyasi.If their portrayal of Sankarabharanam gave the raga a full shape, the kriti &#8216;Akshayalinga Vibho' by Muthuswamy Dikshitar, along with the niraval and the swaras added more substance.&#8216;Ksheera Saagara Sayana' in Devagandhari by Tyagaraja and &#8216;Manasaaramathiyani Sivan Maganai' in Saramathi lent variety to the traditional presentation.Impressive RTPThe sisters had planned their concert well to accommodate an impressive RTP with the pallavi, &#8216;Kannaa, Taamarai Kannaa, Mani Vannaa, Kaarmugil Vannaa' in Shanmukhapriya, set to tisra jathi triputa talam, kanta nadai. The lighter session included the lovely pada in Kannada, &#8216;Bega Baaro, Bega Baaro' by Vadirajaswamy, a slokam followed by Tukharam's abhang, &#8216;Aanikadusare,' and a bhajan on Saraswathi, &#8216;Vandeham Shaaradam' by Dayananda Saraswati. Vijayalakshmi and Chithra concluded it with the galloping tillana by Balamurali Krishna in Kuntalavarali.When one heard the words &#8216;Asamanamana tillana and Vinodhamaana tillana' in the charanam, one wondered whether Balamurali had used them as the composer or as the rasika.Their younger sister, R. Hemalatha, showed equal, if not better, confidence and filled the ears with quintessential melody. K.S. Rangachari, their father and veteran ganjira artist, gave excellent support, and Nellai Balaji showed great prowess on the mridangam.
