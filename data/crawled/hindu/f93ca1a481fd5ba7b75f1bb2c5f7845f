VVocalist Gayathri Girish vividly remembers that as a child of three she would be rewarded with chocolates is she identified ragas correctly. &#8220;I was in Bangalore during the mid 1970s as my father had a job here, and it's nostalgic to rewind to my initial exposure to concerts. As a young kid I recognised Kalyani, Keeravani and some others, drawing applauses from known people in the audience,&#8221; said Gayathri. If that set the beginning for Gayathri, her own passion for getting deeper into the nucleus of any melodic scale soon became intrinsic to her musical persona. Her concert could be termed adventurous with lesser-known attempts as raga-tana-pallavi in Ramapriya, a Dikshitar kriti in Kokilarava and the lilting Gamanashrama for a Surdas bhajan, indicating her desire to take up the uncommon. Daughter of vocalist Padmini Srinivasan, music is an integral part of her, but it required the right channelling. As a six-year-old, Gayathri was brought under the guidance of Vaigai Gnanaskandan of the Semmangudi School for formal training. At 13, she was rearing to perform, and after some sparklers at a competition she received an honour from Dr. M. Balamurali Krishna. Her clarity in diction was rewarded: she was conferred the Sahityapriya title, given away by doyen Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer.Listening to yesteryear greats, observing their styles, reading music literature and exploring the nuances formed a part of her lifestyle, apart from being a student of Mathematics and Computer Applications.Maths, computer and music? &#8220;Believe me all the maths has helped me imbibe an analytical mind. For a creative domain as music, it's been a boon!&#8221; says Gayathri. She also maintains an active blog through which she interacts with her rasikas.The turning point for Gayathri, however, was taking up advanced lessons from T.N. Seshagopalan whom she had heard for several years. &#8220;I yearned to learn from TNS as I was inspired by his overall musicality. I was 19 and I asked him if he could consider me his student. Not only was he forthcoming, he was magnanimous to ask me to retain my style, as I was already a performing musician. Volumes of the finer aspects that he brought into my rendition gave an intellectual weight to my concerts!&#8221; she says.TNS didn't believe in a strict &#8216;learn-to-sing' kind of formatted schooling. &#8220;Capture some of my techniques and blend them to have a &#8216;unique you' in your concerts,&#8221; he always told his students. &#8220;I have fashioned a style of my own, never believing inbeing a photocopy of anybody,&#8221; says Gayathri.But Gayathri cannot stop being in awe of TNS' attention to nitty-gritty that has taken her so far in her 13-year training under him. Demonstrating a sangati in interesting ways she recalls how TNS believed in certain approaches that were unique to male and female singing.&#8220;The patient guru that he was, he even advised us how to cleverly take up certain phrases when we had a running nose. Simple akaara singing, repeating learners' lessons and pranayama were answers for breath management and controlled facial expressions,&#8221; he advised us.Gayathri even learnt the violin under Lalgudi G. Jayaraman and T. Rukmini. As her worldwide tours for performances increased, accolades and honours from major sabhas followed in substantial measure. Erudite critics and scholars have commended her repertoire that ranges from Tamil Tevaaram hymns and Divya Prabhandams to handling Purandaradasa devaranama and handling other creative exercises as her thematic concert on Adi Shankara's &#8220;Shanmatam&#8221; (six kinds of worship).The A-grade AIR artiste has given quite a number of interesting non-routine concerts alongside Hindustani musicians, performed to thavil accompaniment and taken up one-raga-one-kriti concerts too that call for sustained manodharma.
