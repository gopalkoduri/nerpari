VManasanayana, a young\u000aartiste, sang under the\u000aauspices of Bhasange\u000aBalaga at Veene Sheshanna\u000aBhavana in Mysore.\u000aShrikanth G. Mathoor (violin)\u000aand Radhesh (mridanga)\u000asupported Manasa Nayana in\u000ahis honest endeavour to lay\u000abare the nuances of music.Having acquired commendable\u000aproficiency, which imparted\u000arecognisable\u000aprofessional touch to his\u000astyle, the singer was all set to\u000apresent the compositions.\u000aHowever, one could sense a\u000adeficiency in grace, indispensable\u000afor alluring melodic expressions\u000aand method in the\u000aprocess of aesthetically shaping\u000athose expressions.Varna ("Neranammithinayya"\u000a- Kaanada - Atta taala\u000a- Ramnad Srinivasa Iyengar),\u000aalapana in Kamavardhini\u000a("Raamanatham Bhajeham" -\u000aDikshitar) and swaraprastara\u000ain "Vandhisuvudhadhiyali"\u000a(Naata - Purandaradasa) provided\u000aample justification to\u000athe above observations.It would have been advantageous,\u000ahad the artiste taken\u000aa simple and direct path while\u000aelaborating the alapanas and\u000ain framing the kalpanaswaras.\u000aThis would have greatly\u000afacilitated fluency too. The\u000ainnovative singer selected a\u000apassage from Adiga's poetry\u000a- "Kattuvevu Naavu Hosanaadondanu"\u000a- elevating it to\u000athe rank of a full-fledged pallavi\u000ain Mohana, Ritigaula and\u000aCharukeshi, appending it\u000awith equally appealing kalpanaswaras."Yaaru Badukidarayya" of\u000aPurandaradasa sung emotively,\u000avouchsafed the singer's\u000ainvolvement and commitment.\u000aRadhesh's tani avarthana\u000awas an extension of his\u000acomposed percussion\u000athroughout the concert.Ramanath and Gopinath\u000aIyer from Melbourne presented\u000aa veena jugalbandhi at\u000aNadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha,\u000aaccompanied by B. Ravishankar\u000a(mridanga) and S.\u000aManjunath (ghata).The concert started with\u000a"Sarasijanabha", a varna in\u000aKamboji (Swathi Thirunal /\u000aVadivelu). The selected vilamba\u000alaya and the general\u000aprogression reflected the artistes'\u000astrong predisposition\u000ato adhere to an ideal style and\u000aapproach, wherein the musical\u000amovements were supposed\u000ato evolve within a set\u000aframework of classicism, setting\u000aaside redundant diversions.As the vainikas maintained\u000athe same trend all along the\u000aconcert, all the lyrical sections\u000aemerged as if they were\u000asung in furtherance of the intended\u000aimports.It was not until Shankarabharana,\u000awhich they selected\u000afor a detailed rendition,\u000athat the audience could sense\u000aany concrete display of the artiste's\u000aabilities. All the contents\u000aof this presentation -\u000aalapana, lyrics (Thyagaraja's\u000a"Pedhalavale") and swaraprastara\u000aexposed the depths\u000aof the artiste's imagination\u000ainfluencing the essence of the\u000araga and substance of the lyrics.A raga -thana -pallavi ("Harapriye\u000aLalithe", ragamaalika)\u000awas another segment to\u000adraw the attention of any serious\u000alistener. Vasudevachar's\u000a"Pranamamyaham"\u000a(Goula), Swathy Thirunal's\u000a"Narasimha Maamava"\u000a(Arabhi), Vyasaraya's "Krishna\u000aNi Begane Baaro" (Yaman),\u000aThyagaraja's\u000a"Ganamurthe" (Gaanamurthi)\u000awere other highlights.Now, to the shortcomings:\u000aas they did not explore either\u000athe ragas or the lyrics from\u000adifferent perspectives as was\u000aexpected in a jugalbandi, the\u000aconcert did not fulfil the very\u000apurpose of employing two\u000aveenas to any considerable\u000adegree.It gave an impression of\u000aone accompanying another:\u000amore of a complementary artistry\u000athan of an innovative\u000aversatility.Further, in spite of appreciable\u000ageneral fluency, movements\u000aon the frets frequently\u000atripped (observe - Karaharapriya).\u000aIn certain areas (for\u000aexample - while delineating\u000aVarali - "Maamava Meenakshi"\u000a- Dikshitar), one expected\u000amore impressive\u000aimprovisations.
