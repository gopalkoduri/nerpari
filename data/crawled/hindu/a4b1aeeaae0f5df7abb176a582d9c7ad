VExactly a week after Jaipur-Atrauli stalwart Kishori Amonkar's performance in the Capital, Priyadarshini Kulkarni, another representative of the same gharana, sang with commendable confidence and gusto at a concert organised by Raag Rang at New Delhi's India Habitat Centre. She learnt the basics of music from Annasaheb Gunjkar and was later initiated into the Kirana gharana gayaki by Nath Neralkar. However, a chance meeting in 1993 with Rajshekhar Mansur, son and disciple of the great Jaipur-Atrauli maestro Mallikarjun Mansur, changed the direction of her musical journey and she has been learning from him ever since.Jaipur-Atrauli gharana is known for its penchant and preference for complex, uncommon and jod ragas (created by combining two ragas). Priyadarshini Kulkarni made it clear at the outset that she would first sing a prachalit (common) raga, then would move on to her gharana specialities. She began with one of the most common yet immensely beautiful raga Yaman Kalyan and leisurely sang a traditional khayal &#8220;Pat Tore Kavan&#8221; set to vilambit Teen taal. It was not a particularly satisfying rendering as she seemed to be struggling to attain poise and looked somewhat unsure of her creative destination. This happens to the best of artistes at times and is preferable to a pre-conceived and pre-determined rendition or taking an easy way out by cloning the guru or some other great singer. One must admit that despite some rough edges, the beauty of Yaman Kalyan did come through her recital. She fared much better in the popular madhyalaya Teen taal bandish &#8220;Ae Ri Aali Piya Bin&#8221;.In full bloomThe remarkable thing about Priyadarshini's recital was that as the concert progressed, she became better and better and by the time she came to sing Basanti Kedar after having rendered Tilak Kamod, she was in full bloom. She followed up her Yaman Kalyan with a Tilak Kamod and sang the traditional bandish &#8220;Sur Sangat Raga Vidya Sangeet Praman&#8221; composed by the founder of Jaipur-Atrauli gharana Alladiya Khan in madhyalaya Roopak taal. For chhota khayal, Priyadarshini chose a rhythmically very complex composition &#8220;Aavat Ghar Aaye Balam Mora&#8221; and sang it with verve. Her well-chiselled taans were truly impressive.By the time she came to sing Basanti Kedar, a combination of Basant and Kedar, she was in full command of her creative apparatus. She opted for the famous Jaipur-Atrauli composition &#8220;Atar Sugandh&#8221; set to vilambit Teen taal. It was an aesthetically elevating rendition and her creativity was in full flow. Priyadarshini Kulkarni rounded off her recital with a scintillating Kafi Hori &#8220;Kaisi Ye Dhoom Machaaee Kanhai&#8221;. Prasun Chatterjee ably provided accompaniment on the tabla with understatement and understanding but came into his own towards the latter part of the concert, especially in Kafi Hori with his dexterous laggi. Paromita Mukherjee sounded good on the harmonium.CorrectionThe write-up &#8220;In rhythm divine&#8221; published on this Page on April 8, 2011, was written by Kuldeep Kumar.
