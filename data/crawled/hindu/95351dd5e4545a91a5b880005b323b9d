VR.K. Padmanabha sang under the auspices of Shri Krishna Gana Sabha on the opening day of the three-day music series marking the eighth annual celebrations of the Shri Krishna Gana Sabha Music Academy in Mysore recently. Department of Kannada and Culture had co-sponsored the programme.DelightfulIndeed, the veteran singer delighted the audience with his mature style.His treasured repertoire carefully built over many years of ardent devotion and commitment has incorporated elements of rare musical faculties.Further, with good taste, he has refined his scholarship, carrying it to great heights, ideally serving two objectives of music: bringing about a transformation in oneself and inspiring the listener to move towards that goal of ineffable musical experience.His voice perfectly synchronising with shruthi at all levels, modulated perfectly to match with the accentuations the sahitya warranted; and at the same, spontaneously elicited the moods the ragas nurtured and expected.In addition, the well-honed articulations explicitly interpreted the presentations in their entireties.One can fully comprehend the depth into which the artiste delved while expatiating Nayaki (&#8220;Kanagonu Soukhyamu&#8221; - Thyagaraja) and Kalyani (raga-tana-pallavi).The rich voice resonated pleasingly, exposing the contemplative mood of Nayaki (which also has a shade of plaintiveness to it), and reverberatedvigorously, demonstrating the majesty the ragainhered.CompetenceThe manner in which he elaborated the raga gave an indication of his competence in executing nabhitanas. In fact, this observation gained more testimony later in Kalyani, wherein he executed them with great imagination and mastery.Some of the deep graces stood for the phenomenon of vaadyakaku, where the singing style simulated tonal qualities of musical instruments. In this case, for example the resonance of the tanas perfectly matched with those of the mridanga in both depth and tone.The pallavi was &#8220;Kalyani Kanchi Kamakshi&#8221;, which he built mainly in faster paces (with a few movements in slower ones, he could have emotively enriched the lyrics).Kalpanaswaras in ragamalika- Naata, Gowla, Arabhi, Varali, Shri, Pushpalathika, Anandabhairavi, Rithigoula and Chandrakauns consummated the experience.AccompanistsThani avarthana evidenced the percussionists' (C. Cheluvaraju on mridanga and G. S. Ramanujam on ghata) fervour, and the melody accompanist (S.N. Chandrasekhar) followed the lead artiste with equal verve.&#8220;Jalajaksha&#8221; (Varna-Hamsadhwani-Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer) preserved crispness and melody in spite of different speeds the singer chose, irrefragably establishing his authority over both shruthi and laya. &#8220;Ganamurthe&#8221; (Ganamurthy -Thyagaraja), &#8220;Entha Vedukondhu Raghava&#8221; (Saraswathimanohari- reminding one of lively and wondrous taara sthayi sancharas alluringly executed by the luminary singer-actor Thyagaraja Bhagavathar), &#8220;Tharakka Bindige&#8221; (Tillang-Purandaradasa), &#8220;Enu Baredeyo Brahma&#8221; (Sindhubhairavi-Purandaradasa), &#8220;Chapalavirabeku&#8221; (Kaapi) and a Thillana (Hamsanandi-the last two were his own creative works) constituted the concert.
