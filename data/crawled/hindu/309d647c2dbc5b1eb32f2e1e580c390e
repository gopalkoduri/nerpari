VM. RAMESHAt a time when  well-rehearsed music and imitative artistry seem to be the norm, it is refreshing to see a youngster striving to explore the uncharted waters of Carnatic music. If Abishek Raghuram had not taken to music, he would probably have become an explorer &#151;  that's the impression one gets from watching his performance on the stage.Last week, in his concert for the Music Academy in the HCL series, this grandson of noted mridangist, Palghat Raghu, and disciple of P.S.Narayanasami, showed his penchant for the road-not-frequented by picking up Suruti as the main piece.Abishek tackled Suruti as though he had never done anything in his life except practise singing the raga. The raga's identity came out in the opening notes of the alapana and many rasikas thought it was to be a filler between the previous Poorvikalyani and the main raga of the evening.Superb alapanaBut as the evening wore on, it was as though the young artiste was saying, ``You know, there is so much scope in this little raga." It was a superb alapana, full of phrases that are not usually captured in the tiny tail-piece that the raga is usually taken up for. Incidentally, during the last music season, S.P.Ramh, sang an elaborate Suruti, but Abishek's was even more elaborate. Violinist M.S.Varadarajan, whose Poorvikalyani was pedestrian, got his act together in Suruti and presented a lovely alapana, matching the vocalist's. Abishek then presented Dikshitar's `Sri Venkata Girisham,' with niraval and swaras at `Alamelu Manga.' The highlight of the rendition was several cycles of swara sets in kanta nadai, which underscored the young vocalist's control over laya.  In fact, the Suruti was so good that it eclipsed the previous beautiful Poorvikalyani (`Avataraya Maam' of Narayana Tirtha). Towards the end of the concert came another brilliant nugget &#151;  Purandara Dasar's `Naaneke Badavano' in Behag. It is a melancholy song set to a not-so-melancholy raga, but Abishek brought out the emotive appeal of the raga in full.Trivandrum V. Balaji gave adequate support on the mridangam. His tani included a foray into tisra nadai, but a few cycles in kanta nadai would have been appropriate, considering that Abishek chose that gait in his swara singing.Bottom Template Starts
