VRhythem Digital RMCD 0005 &#151;  Carnatic Music Violin &#151;  Violin Delights &#151;  Usha Rajagopalan &#151;  Rs. 99.USHA RAJAGOPALAN, a popular contemporary violinist, has moulded her skills on the Lalgudi bani, having had the benefit of guidance from Lalgudi Padmavathi Anantagopalan and Lalgudi himself. In this album titled, "Violin Delights" she has rendered eleven compositions of different composers like Tyagaraja, Annamacharya, Pallavi Seshayyar, Maha Vaidyanatha Sivan, Madurai Srinivasan, Vyasaraya, Narayana Tirtha and a tillana in Hamsanandi by Lalgudi Jayaraman."Ramaneepai" in Kedaram with the anuswarams being immaculate, puts the volume on an impressive track."Vande Vasudevam," an Annamacharya kriti beautifully tuned in Sriragam by Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer with a racy chittaswaram, and "Palinthuvo" in the vivadi mela Kantamani spell quality, though the latter could have been played at a slower kalapramanam to emphasise the exclusive beauty of the raga in full measure.Dikshitar's masterpiece in Dwijavanti, "Akhilandeswari" mentioned as a `Pallavi Seshayyar' creation in the programme details, and "Enthanee Vina Vindura" in raga Urmika as a Tyagaraja kriti instead of Pallavi Seshayyar's need to be corrected in the following editions.Urmika, a rare melody, is a janya of Mela Simhendramadhyamam, sans the suddha dhaivatam in its ascending and descending scales.Usha's alapana, though brief is flawless, appropriately eschewing even a hint of the dhaivatam.The chittaswaram composed by Lalgudi sparkling with rhythmic sequences gives a lively bearing to the song version. "Najeevadara" is a Tyagaraja classic in Bilahari with a plethora of sangatis in the kriti structure. The artiste has shown commendable sensitivity to the raga lakshana by using the phrase `sdrssnnd' instead of the favoured `snrssnnd' in her kriti interpretation &#151;  probably due to her meticulous training.The kalpanaswaras are played with precision and reveal the musician's natural propensity for laya exactness. "Karunai Deivame" (Sindu Bhairavi), "Krishna Nee Begane" (Yamunakalyani), "Kalasa Yashodhe" (ragamalika) do fine-tune the aural impact, while the tillana provides the grand finale.Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar on the mridangam and Madipakkam Murali on the ghatam have played the tani avartanam with palpable vibrancy and enthusiasm, while their accompanying efforts are subdued and sensitive. &#151;S.P.Bottom Template Starts
