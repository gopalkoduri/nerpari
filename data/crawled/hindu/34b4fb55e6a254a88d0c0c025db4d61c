VB. RAMADEVIPlaying the guitar, R. Prasanna gave a modern twist to traditional Carnatic music. He was performing for Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore, at Nani Palkhiwala Auditorium during the September Season 2005. His very first varnam in Nattakkurinji `Neranammithi' made one sit up.The majestic swarajathi in Bhairavi `Kaamaakshi, Ambaa' by Shyama Sastri was melodious and soothing.`Samayamidhe' in Budhamanohari was swift. His delineation of the ragas was very fresh and he gave samples of `graha bedham' and `raga bedham' during his alapana of Sudha Saveri preceding Periasamy Thooran's `Thaaye thripura sundari.'He touched Hindolam, Mohanam, Sudha Dhanyasi and Madhyamavati and deftly came back to Sudha Saveri.The accompanying giants, Mannargudi Eswaran on the mridangam and S. Kathick on the ghatam, joined the celebration with equal vigour and enjoyment.Excellent combinationsAbhishek Raghuram  began with `Pagavari,' a varnam in Hamsadwani by Pattanam Subramanya Iyer. `Sabapathikku veru deivam' in Abhogi with excellent combinations of kalpanaswaras was amazing. His alapana of Devagandhari before he started `Evarikkai' by Thyagaraja was good and his hard work was apparent in the ease with which he sang. `Saamagana lolane' in Hindolam was an aural treat. `Saatileni guruguha murthy' in Purvikalyani was presented as the central piece and he tried to fathom the depths of the raga during the alapana and neraval. `Singara murthy' in Khamas, `Subrahmanya dhayala' in Kaapi, `Gayathi vanamali' in Durga, `Muddhugare yashodha' were some of the delightful  songs.  V.L. Kumar on the violin gave him good support. Maestro Palakkad Raghu on the mridangammesmerised the audience.Bottom Template Starts
