VSri Karthikeya Gana Sabha celebrated its first anniversary with a traditional vocal concert by R.V. Panduranga Sharma. The vocalist had his training from music stalwarts like Puranam Purushotama Sastry and D.K. Pattammal and has been lucky to be blessed by them. The concert reflected his good taste in classical music and his adherence to &#8216;pattammal bani'.He began his concert with thodi varnam Era napai. Maha ganapathi in nata narayani was elegantly rendered. Mayamalava gowla was briefly hummed for Thyagaraja's meru samana with swaram in it. Krupa jhuchutaku in chayatarangini was a brief interlude.Poorvikalyani came as a first expansion and the ragam was sung in its right proportion for Gnanamosagaradha in rupakam with detailed neraval and swarakalpana. Chittam irangavillayo in sriranjani, a Tamil composition, was neatly rendered.The main attraction of the day was Shankarabharanam. He took utmost care that the content of the raga was maintained throughout the alaap. Sarojadalanetri of Syama Sastry was an apt composition in the temple premises with neraval and kalpana swara done in a humble way.Uma Shankar on the violin followed the artiste in a subdued way. Srinivas on the mridangam lent neat support. Panduranga Sharma concluded his recital with Subramanya Bharathiyar's composition Engal Nattuku Enda Nadu, a patriotic song, and sung in a melodious way. Overall sharma's concert was refreshing and also attribute to the sabha which is entering into its second year.This sabha organised the concert at its regular venue, the Sri Lakshmi Ganapathi Temple at RTC X-Roads.
