VDeparting from the usual format, Carnatic vocalist and playback singer P. Unnikrishnan began his concert with a full-fledged Tyagaraja kirthanam &#8216;Vadera Deivamu,&#8217; set to Adi tala, in Pantuvarali. The alapanam, both vocal and instrumental, was elaborate.&#8216;Sobhillu Saptaswara,&#8217; a Tyagaraja composition in Jaganmohini in Roopaka tala,  had a niraval that was full of varied gamakas.The next item was &#8216;Bagayanayya,&#8217; a Tyagaraja composition in Chandrajyothi. The detailed alapanam presented the different scales of this raga. With its characteristic Shuddha Gandharam, it has the cooling effect of a moonlit night. The essence of the raga was perfectly conveyed by the singer. The niraval and manodharma swaras were based around the opening line, &#8216;Bagayanayya.&#8217;The light composition &#8216;Mamava Jagadeeswara&#8217; in Saraswathi Manohari followed the grand movement of Chandrajyothi. The buoyant flow of the sancharas was especially suited to Unnikrishnan&#8217;s light voice.Kalyani, the eternal favourite, was the main raga.  A superb introductory exposition saw the vocalist traverse the high and low registers and every nuance of the raga was defined.   Trichy N.C. Madhav complemented the vocal rendering on the violin. The well-known Swati Tirunal composition &#8216;Pankaja Lochana,&#8217; set to Mishrachapu tala, was sung with niraval and manodharma at &#8216;Vrindavana.&#8217; Taniavartanam by Kuzhalmannam Ramakrishnan (mridangam) and Thripunithura Radhakrishnan (ghatom) came as a fitting finale to the grand portrayal.Unnikrishnan chose Vrindavan Sarang for Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi (RTP). One saw glimpses of a Hindustani style  alaap in his delineation. Tanam traversed through some complicated passages. &#8216;Ranganey Sreeranganey&#8217; was the Pallavi. Another rare feature of the RTP, besides the choice of raga, was the foray into Ragamalika. Bahudari, Ranjini and Vasanthi were the ragas that  the audience got to enjoy. While summing up, he flitted effortlessly across all these ragas once again. A profusion of gamakas heightened the beauty of the rendition.  &#8216;Pibarey Rama Rasam&#8217;  in Ahir Bhairav and  a thillana  in Hamsanandi were some of the other songs that were sung.Unnikrishnan&#8217;s voice has a timbre which is unconventional, especially in the field of classical music. Arduous practice and a deep commitment to the discipline have resulted in his obvious mastery over the medium.  From the first note to the last, this was a concert where a high level of classicism was maintained and there was no compromise or dilution of standards.  The concert was organised by Rasikapriya.
