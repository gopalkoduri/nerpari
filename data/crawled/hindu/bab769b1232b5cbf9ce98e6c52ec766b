VIt is gratifying to see that the present generation of established musicians enjoys a rapport with up and coming musicians, and also encourage and promote them. T.M. Krishna's Sumanasa Foundation presents &#8216;Utsaha', a festival to make visible the talent of many youngsters, both from Chennai and other States.This edition of Utsaha's four-day programme began with Ranjani Hebbar's vocal recital at the Raga Sudha hall. Ranjani's competent well proportioned and strategically placed Khambodi alapana was the core item of her concert. Using her clear and sonorous voice to her advantage, Ranjani detailed Khambodi punctuated with melodious phrases. . The choice &#8216;Rangasayee' of Tyagaraja with leisurely niraval and swaras on &#8216;Bhooloka Vaikuntam', heightened the quality of the concert and projected the sincerity of the singer. Her earlier essays of Anandabhairavi (&#8216;Anandeswaram' by Dikshitar) and Varali (&#8216;Dikkuverillai' of Papanasam Sivan) augured well with the tenor of the performance.B.K. Raghu from Bengaluru on the violin shared equal footage providing extra strength to the team work that comprised of Madurai Venkatasubramaniam on the mridangam and Udupi S. Srikanth from Thiruvananthapuram on the ganjira. The percussionists played a subdued yet strongly etched tani avartanam.Dominant gamakasNotwithstanding the torrential downpour, many had assembled to appreciate the melodious veena concert of Ashwin Anand from Bengaluru. The vital feature of the veena playing, the gamaka, was dominant in his offerings. His raga treatises were replete with pleasant phrases. Essays of Ramapriya (&#8216;Korinavara Mosakumayya' of Patnam Subramania Iyer), Begada (&#8216;Nadopasana' of Tyagaraja), and Shanmukhapriya (Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi) showed signs of his internalised musical output in its pure form.The sahitya bhava of the kritis was discernible in numbers such as &#8216;Brovavamma' in Manji of Syama Sastri, &#8216;Ora Joopu Joochedi' in Kanndagowla of Tyagaraja, &#8216;Palukava Demira' in Devamanohari of Vasudevachar and &#8216;Swaminatha Paripalaya' in Nattai of Dikshitar.Ashwin kept a tight leash on his swara exercises. The swarakalpana and niraval were judicious in approach. With good veena artists dwindling in number, Ashwin's entry is a promising one.Palayamkottai B. Guru Raghavendran was on the mridangam and G. Venkatesh (Visakhapatnam) was on the morsing. Veena somehow does not entertain the support of morsing. Understanding this, Guru Raghavendran underplayed and Venkatesh was almost invisible. They came alive in their tani.Vechoor Shankar's vocal concert was full of fizz and zing; not a single dull moment, but at the same time there was not a single place where the music provided repose till the Neelambari piece.Shankar was spirited in Sama (&#8216;Annapoorne Visalakshi' of Dikshitar) and Kalyani expansions and in Swati Tirunal's &#8216;Pankaja Lochana.' Later, Madhyamavati offered him the scope for infusing poignancy; but Shankar just gave a go by for kaarvais and depended more on fast moving motifs.Speedy niravalThe intrinsic emotion and melody of &#8216;Palinchu Kamakshi' (Syama Sastri) endured the speedy niraval on the charanam and swaras.Shankar's swara trips were tempestuous; well, the rapid swaras may bring applause but they hardly contribute for artistic quality.If Shankar contemplates over this aspect, it will be constructive. It was really endearing to hear him bring out many intricate hues of Neelambari in Swati Tirunal's &#8216;Kaanthanodu Chennu.'K.J. Dileep on the violin showed maturity in the Madhyamavati essay. S. Ashok on the mridangam and Karthik Mani on the ghatam were full of energy through out.The resonant voice and confident presentation made one sit up and listen to young S.R. Vinay Sharva from Bengaluru. In Manodharma sangeetham glowed in Vinay's attempt and rendition; be it a simple Sriraga Varnam &#8216;Sami Ninne' or Tyagaraja's emotional &#8216;Eti Janmam Itiha' in Varali.Suruti occupied central place with an excellent essay and Muthuswami Dikshitar's &#8216;Sri Venkatesa Gireesam' suffixed by competent niraval and swaras on &#8216;Alamelumanga Sametham.'Vinay's raga expansions of Begada (&#8216;Vallabha Nayakasya' by Dikshitar), Suruti and Varali carried freshness. His swarakalpanas were impressive.Peroor E.B. Jayaprakash of Thiruvananthapuram ably assisted on the violin. His responses in Begada swaras and raga treatises of Varali and Surutti deserve special mention.Mridangist P.S. Sanoj (Guruvayoor) and S. Swaminathan on the ganjira kept the percussion aspect brisk.
