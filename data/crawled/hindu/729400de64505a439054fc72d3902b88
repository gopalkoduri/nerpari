VThe MES Kalavedi&#8221;s Ammanni Iyengar Endowment Programme in Bangalore recently had a vocal concert by the Rudrapatnam Brothers, R.N. Thyagarajan and R.N. Tharanathan .The performance got off to an excellent start with &#8220;Samidayajuda&#8221; the Kedaragoula varna in adi thala, followed by the majestic cadence of Oothukadu Venkatasubbaier&#8221;s &#8220;Srivighnarajam Bhaje&#8221; in Gambhiranatta. Swathi Thirunal&#8221;s &#8220;Devadeva Kalayami&#8221; in Mayamalavagoula was remarkable for the neraval at &#8220;Jatharupa Nibhachela&#8221;.The alapana of Yadukula Kamboji, the rendition of Deekshithar&#8221;s Navagraha krithi &#8220;Divakara Thanujam&#8221; and the ensuing kalpana swaras were examples of unalloyed classicism, tempered with a refined aesthetic sensibility, brimming with the essence of the raga, and reflected faithfully in the outstanding solo of violinist Charulatha Ramanujam. Madhyamavathi was elaborated with alluring phrases that progressed note by note, and succeeded by the Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Nadupai&#8221; in khanda chapu thala, with neraval and kalpana swaras at the charana sahithya &#8220;Payojaksha&#8221;, the latent rhythmic possibilities of which were exploited in masterly fashion.A leisurely &#8220;Brovavamma&#8221;, Syama Shastri&#8221;s composition in Manji and misra chapu thala was prelude to a comprehensive alapana of Kalyani replete with gamaka oriented phrases. The grandeur and beauty of Thyagaraja&#8221;s &#8220;Ethavunara&#8221; in adi thala were underscored by a detailed neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Srikarudagu Thyagaraja Kararchitha&#8221;, closing with several avarthanas of diminishing duration ending at the nishada, and followed by a scintillating thani avarthana.*** The Indian Institute Of World Culture, presented a vocal duet by the Saralaya Sisters, Kavitha and Thriveni, as part of the Sushila Parthasarathy and Dr. M.D. Parthasarathy Endowment Programme. The concert began with the varna &#8220;Abalagopalamu&#8221; set to Amrithavarshini raga and adi tala, and the Abhogi krithi &#8220;Sree Mahaganapathe&#8221; in khanda chapu thala, to which were appended a few lively kalpana swaras.A sloka in Lalitha raga led to a bhava-laden exposition of the Deekshithar composition &#8220;Hiranmayeem Lakshmeem,&#8221; with a bracing rendition of the celebrated krithi in Janaranjani, &#8220;Pahimam Srirajarajeswari&#8221; providing a dramatic change of mood immediately afterwards.Shanmukhapriya was taken up for a compact alapana that illumined the salient features of the raga.. &#8220;Ekamreshanayakeem&#8221;, the Deekshithar composition in adi thala featured a meticulously-rendered neraval at &#8220;Mookamukhya Vakpradayineem&#8221; and kalpana swaras in two speeds. The final spell focused on the panchama, with the vocalists alternately emphasizing the notes in ascending order from the dhaivatha upwards, ending with a variety of rhythmic combinations in the shorter avarthanas, and followed by a concise thani avarthana.Unfortunately, an imperfect sound system robbed the concert of its sparkle.
