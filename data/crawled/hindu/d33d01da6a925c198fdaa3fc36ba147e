VThe bedrock of Hinduism is the Vedas whose chanting is said to spread vibrations of peace and good thought. The frenetic pace of modern life does not allow chanting of Vedic hymns let alone learning them. The next best way to reciting the mantras would be to listen to them recorded. With this object in view and to keep the tradition of the Vedas alive in Hindu homes, Vedic Links (353/1, Dr. Lakshmanasamy Salai, K. K. Nagar) has brought out Krishna Yajur Veda &#151;  Sakhai and Samhitai &#151;  recorded on 46 CDs. Sakhai comprises Arunam, Ashtagam and Kadagam. The slokas have been lucidly rendered by a team of four Vedic scholars &#151;  Sridara Sarma, Sundaresa Ghanapadigal, Visvanatha Ghanapadigal and Sri Gajanana Sarma.The package costs Rs. 3,850. Temples will get a concession. Cassettes, costing Rs. 1,800, are also available.The albums come with a handbook, ``Hinduism &#151;  An Article of Faith," dedicated to Sri Santhananda Brahmendra Saraswati Avadoota Swamigal, one of the main inspirations behind the task, the other being the Paramacharya &#151;  that guides the listener with details about the contents of the CDs, short notes on Vedic concepts and so on.The publisher appeals to the reader to buy original albums to keep the project that sustains scholars going. Temples and institutions should reverberate with the chanting of the Vedas, goes the plea. Homes too should resonate with the sounds. Vedic Links has also released CDs of Taitriya Upanishad, Suryanamaskaram in a comprehensive form and Yajurveda Achida Aswamedha parayanam.For details contact 24744188.
