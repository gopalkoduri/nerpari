VHealing through musical notes set to different ragas called &#8216;NadaTherapy&#8217; has been in vogue in India for more than 6000 years. It has been improved upon by various composers in their innovative methods. During the last two decades, music lovers and devotees of Sri Ganapathi Sachchidananda Swami of Datta Peetham, Mysore, India have been getting a festive treat throughout the world with hundreds of his concerts. He had given public performances at over 150 centres in various parts of the globe.Datta Yoga Center and Yoga Sangeeta, New Jersey, USA got up a soul stirring musical concert of Swamiji at the famed Lincoln Center, in New York.One highlight of Swamiji&#8217;s Healing Concert on recently is the presence of internationally renowned violinist L. Subramaniam.Ably accompanied by the instrumentalists, Varanasi Jaitra (violin) Sumitra (violin) and Sankar Ramesh (mridangam) besides L. Subramaniam, Swamiji took the audience drawn from various parts of the world to the elysium through his celestial message rendered in musical compositions with varying powers of physical healing and spiritual ennobling. The physical ailments which have a sure cure are related to the respiratory, circulatory and secretive systems of the body with the stimulation and toning of the nervous system according to Sri Swamiji.The five ragas chosen for a special effect viz., Anagha, Vasanti, Kokila, Naga Nandini and Simhendra Madhyamam by Swamiji are with their synchronisation of the five elements of fire, earth, air, water and ether respectively.While the first one is Swamiji&#8217;s own, the second in the Pentatonic and the third in Hexatonic and the fourth and fifth in Septatonic are invested with varying notes ranging from one to seven. As for the literary compositions, the first onePranava Swaroopamin Rushyaketupriya Adi taal is an invocation to Lord Ganesh.The secondAghanasanain Gaanamurti again in Adi taal in which Sri Swamiji extols the Lord of Trinity, Dattatreya .The third composition is in a way distinct with 12 notes combined as a gamut specially set in quadratonic (innovative as such), pentatonic, hexatonic, septatonic and octave in the combination of the natural sound energies of the five elements.
