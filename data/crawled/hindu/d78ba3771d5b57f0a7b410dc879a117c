VHe was provided a &#8216;platform' and not a &#8216;stage'. So he sat with the audience and performed. Nevertheless, his performance was an elevated one.K. Venkateshwaran, who gave a vocal concert during the 21st Sasthapreeti celebrations of Vedic Prachar Sansthan of neighbouring Noida, put up a spirited performance for about two hours. His concert was packed with compositions, predominantly of Papanasam Sivan's. His superb performance and that of his accompanying artistes' elevated the quality of the concert.Venkateshwaran started with the popular composition of Papanasam Sivan, &#8220;Saranam Ayyappa&#8221; in raga Mukhari, his emotive presentation wellsuited the occasion. The brief sketch of the raga that he presented earlier, made it vivid. Another Sivan composition, &#8220;Ka va va kanda&#8221; in raga Varali met a good treatment too. The alap in the beginning and the swaraprastharas towards the end brought out the creative aspects of the vocalist.As his central item, Venkateshwaran took up yet another Sivan's composition, &#8220;Paratpara parameshwara&#8221; in raga Vachaspati. Being the 64th melakarta raga, itdiffers from raga Kalyani (the 65th melakarta raga) by only one note. The previous melakarta raga (63rd), namely Latangi differs with this raga by two notes. Nevertheless, Vachaspati has an identity of its own and a vocalist has to be very careful while delineating the raga.Though Venkateshwaran began with a slightly shaky start, he soon gained ground and ended up presenting a good sketch of the raga. Further improvisations were in the form of creative neraval of the phrase &#8220;Hari ayanum kaanna ariyaa jothi&#8221; and an equally creative swaraprastharas. Venkateshwaran's diction throughout the concertwas very good.R. Saravanan on the violin, and Lalgudi Ganesh on the mridangam, provided enthusiastic support to the vocalist throughout the concert. While Saravanan's sketch of the ragas Varali and Vachaspati was delightful, Ganesh's brief tani avartanam (percussion solo) in Adi tala was captivating.Venkateshwaran had his initial training in music from Savitri Ramamoorthy and Sai Bhavani. Later, he underwent a rigorous training from Padma Natesan and has been pursuing advanced training from Radha Venkatachalam. Students' concertElsewhere, in Delhi's Mayur Vihar area, students of Vasanthy Krishna Rao presented an impressive vocal concert at Uttara Guruvayurappan temple. A total of six students divided their time slot almost equally, to present some Carnatic music and devotional songs on Lord Ayyapppan. Considering that this was the first stage performance of these students, they did an impressive job in aspects of concert singing, namely the &#8216;kalpitha' music (music as learnt) as well as the &#8216;manodharma' music (creative music).R. Sridhar on the violin, and K. Sreeram on the mridangam, provided encouraging support to the children during their Carnatic music session. Theconcert was presented during the Mandala pooja celebrations of the temple. VENKATESAN SRIKANTH
