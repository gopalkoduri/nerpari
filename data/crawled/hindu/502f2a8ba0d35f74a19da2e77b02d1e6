VPerhaps the most treasured reward of the VSK baithaks is the deep sense of fulfilment and musical satisfaction it provides to listeners by creating an inspiring ambience for the invited artistes to give theirbest. In each baithak, the entire evening is devoted to just one artiste with no time limit  and is granted full freedom to choose the ragas of choice. It was a benefit baithak for Indian Cancer Society this time that presented Pandit Vinayak Torvi&#8217;s vocal recital at the Satya Sai Sabhagara in New Delhi this past week. Born into a family of kirtankaras from Dharawad, Pandit Vinayak Torvi&#8217;s career as a vocalist par excellence was preordained. Initiated into classical music at a young age by some of the best teachers in Dharwad, he was further groomed in Gwalior and Agra gayaki  by Pandit Gururam Deshpande during his 12 year gurukulvasa under him. He received additional guidance from Vasavraj Rajguru, Pandit Mallikarjun Mansoor and Gangu Bai Hangal. His music also reminds you of the young Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, who guided him in his latter years. Vinayak ji takes pride in rejoicing the Bharat Ratna awarded to his guru by stating &#8220;I got this Ratna 20 years back.&#8221;At the VSK baithak, he opened his recital with raga Bageshri. Sketching the outline of the raga in the initial aalap he took time to colour it in great detail during the bara khayal &#8216;Kaun gat bhai&#8230;&#8217; set to slow Ek tala, with meticulous barhat (exploration) of the raga. The bol-aalap, sargams, bol-taans and the varied aakar taan patterns adorned the couple of chota khayals as well that he sang with gay abundance. It was amazing to see individual notes being sung in their ascending and descending orders like the dhaivat going up with the touch of madhyam or coming down with the touch of Komal Nishad. This command of Sur-lagaav (treating the note) gave commendable maturity to his expression.Raga Kedar was his next choice with the slow Teen tala composition &#8216;Ban than aayi&#8230;&#8217; followed by a medium tempo composition of the old world charm &#8216;Soch samajh man meet piyarawa&#8230;&#8217; and the popular bandish &#8216;Kanha re&#8230;&#8217; in Teen tala. Special mention should be made about the accompanying artistes Prasun Chaterjee on the tabla and Vinay Mishra on the harmonium who could reproduce even the meend from dhaivat to madhyam. The vocalist appreciating his accompanying artistes in between his singing was a pleasant sight. The bhajan that followed Kedar had shades of Hansadhwani, Kalawati, Jansammohini, Khambhawati of Bageshri ang, Shankara and Shuddha-Kalyan et al. The laagi  on the tabla was musically engaging.Darbari, the raga de resistance, came after the interval. The majestic raga created by the legendary Miyan Tansen, was treated with all its grandeur. The oscillation of the mandra dhaivat and the Ati-Komal Gandhar vouched for the masterly command and the maturity of the erudite vocalist. The bara khayal &#8216;Hazrat tore kamaan&#8230;&#8217; was given a dhrupad-like treatment during the bol-taan in Tigun. The gamak-taans especially suited the gravity of the raga. A couple of chhota khayals were also rendered in this raga including the famous &#8216;Ghooghat ka pat khol&#8230;&#8217; set to Teen tala. Also, Vinayak ji obliged Salima Raza (daughter of Faiz) a guest from Pakistan, with Shankara on her request, before concluding the concert with Bhairavi.
