VGeetha Raja presented a vocal concert under the auspices of the Rasika Ranjana Sabha recently.She maintained good tempo through out the concert. The varnam in Saveri and Koteeswara Iyer's &#8216;Varana Mugava' in Hamsadhwani were well received.&#8216;Tyagarajaya' in Begada had a sensitive touch. Followed by &#8216;Pirava Varam' in Lathangi, &#8216;Vinarathana' in Devagandhari, Geetha Raja handled Kiravani and that kept the audience engrossed. &#8216;Kaliyundekhadha' in Kiravani was an exemplary hit.Kalyani Shanker accompanied her on the violin and her performance was praise worthy.Koviladi Madhwaprasad on the mridangam and Vishnupuram Ragu on the morsing ably supported Geetha Raja. Thani avartanam by Madhwaprasad and Ragu adorned the set.
