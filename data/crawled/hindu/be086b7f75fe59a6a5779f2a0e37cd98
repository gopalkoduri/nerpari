VP.R. NairRenganatha Sharma, disciple and son of Sangeetha Vidwan Cherthala Narayana Iyer, who belongs to the Semmangudi school, is now settled in Madurai and works as a lecturer of music in Sri Sathguru College of Music. It was, therefore, natural that the Semmangudi touch was evident in his concert, which was organised under the aegis of Edapally Sangeetha Sadas recently.Prof. Sharma started the concert with a varnam `Neevegathi' in Nalinakanthi, set to Adi talam. This was followed by `Ninne Bhajana' in Nata raga (Adi thalam). A superb delineation of `Dwijawanthi,' prelude to the famous Dikshitar kriti `Akhilandeswari' in Chowka kala was memorable. Thyagaraja's `Chinna natina' in Adi tala set the tempo of the concert. The brisk pace and briefswaraprastharamadded to the charm of this kriti.The rendering of `Ennalu puraga' in Subha Panduvarali (set to Chapu tala) was brilliant. The niraval at `Sarimatanale' brought out theragabhavamfully. Ragam Thanam Pallavi was the major item of the concert and Prof. Sharma's elaboration of Bhairavi raga was melodious. Edapally Ajithkumar was superb on the violin and skilfully accompanied the vocalist.  Trichur Jayakrishnan on the mridangam  and Parur Gopakumar on the mukharsangh also did a good job.The thani they played in `khandajathi thriputa' (9 beats) deserve special mention.The programme concluded with a bhajan (`Murali murare') and a crisp thillana followed by mangalam brought the concert to a close.Bottom Template Starts
