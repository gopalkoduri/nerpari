VS. SIVAKUMARNirmala Rajasekar's veena concert for Hamsadhwani made certain things immediately plain. She must have actively pursued this instrument over the years &#151;  a genuine lifelong passion &#151;  to attain this present level of expertise and self-confidence, which combined well with her presentation methods.The veena itself has become a `minority keeping' these days, but those desirous of performing on stage have, without exception, a level of extraordinary proficiency. `Edhayya Gathi' (Chala Nata-Koteeswara Iyer) had a gratifying alapana to bring out its vivadhi nature, whereas Abhogi (`Sabapathikku' - Goplakrishna Bharati) and Varali (`Mamava Meenakshi' - Dikshitar) had an almost religious adherence to a staid patanthara and subtle usage of key prayoga swaras &#151;  controlled shifts and quaint phrases that are close to the idiom of the veena.Nirmala chose to play `Rama Bhakti Saamrajyam' (Suddha Bangala - Tyagaraja), `Brova Baarama' (Bahudari - Tyagaraja) and `Oruthi Maganai Pirandhu' (Behag - Andal's Tiruppavai) to give fullness to the concert. Most pertinently, those familiar with the sahitya of the songs rendered, could easily follow line after line as it sourced from the veena.Srinivasan on the mridangam and Ernakulam Ramakrishnan on the ghatam provided smooth rhythmic comfort during the songs and presented a thani with soft hands working patterns of great order.Bottom Template Starts
