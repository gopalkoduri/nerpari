VSri Karthikeya Gaana Sabha featured a veena recital by Jaya Shekar from Malaysia. This programme was organised as part of an endowment concert in memory of Sannidhanam Kusuma. Hailing from a traditional music parampara, Jaya is the disciple of Sripada Pinakapani.Jaya performed along with P. Jaya Bhasker and Ramakrishna on the ghatam. Jaya began her concert with Jalajakshi varnam in Hamsadwani followed by Sri Maha Ganapathe in Gowla of Dikshitar with crisp swarams in it. The tonal quality was good and sruthi alignment was maintained throughout the concert which is the key to the success of a veena player. Bhudha masrayami in Natakuranji of Dikshitar was a rare item and was neatly presented. Kedaram was briefly alaaped for Ramaneepai with swarams in sarvalaghu patterns.Simhendramadyam was detailed for a neat ragalapana for Ninnenammi Naiyya in misra chapu. The neraval and swaram were interesting. Vade venkatadri meeda in Vasanta, an excellent composition of Annamayya, was composed by Sripada Pinakapani.Jaya took Thodi for the day and gave a pure picture of the ragam, maintaining a striking balance in both the octaves for a masterpiece of Sivan Karthikeyagangeya in adi. The neraval and swarakalpana were soothing and the mridangam support by Bhasker was good, maintaining the tempo of the concert.
