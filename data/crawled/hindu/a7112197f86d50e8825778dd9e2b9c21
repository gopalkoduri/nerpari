VOnly the initial lessons can give you a strong grounding&#8220;Please take me as your student,&#8221; she had pleaded with him. &#8220;Only if you come to Madras,&#8221; said the master, and soon after, the shy teenager had stepped into the Gurukula of Ramnad Krishnan  for higher lessons in Carnatic music.That was when Mysore Nagamani Srinath was awestruck with the deluge of melody she was exposed to for five years from the yesteryear greats. Nagamani, was then receiving a government scholarship at Karnatik Music College, where stalwarts such as Palghat K.V. Narananaswamy, T.M. Tyagarajan, T.N. Krishnan, T. Brinda and Porur Anantaraman were amongst the visiting professors.If Nagamani has today earned a niche for herself in a field where artistes vie for attention, it is because of the farsightedness of her parents Gubbi Narayana and Venkatalakshamma. &#8220;That bold step from my parents brought me to Mysore, from Jodigubbi in Hassan District where I was born, for training under Arekere Narayana Rao,&#8221; she says. After her gurukula, she returned to Mysore to get a Masters in music and later served Maharani&#8217;s College at both Mysore and Bangalore as the HOD of Music. She is now on the guest faculty at Bangalore University. The performer is now elated that most of her compositions are already being sung by top-rung musicians on stage.Recently her two-CD MP3-album &#8220;Sangeeta Sadhane&#8221;, was released jointly supported by Sunaada Cultural Centre and Ananya GML Cultural Academy &#8211; the first of its kind that would be handy to cover portions in Carnatic music, especially targeted at the Karnataka Government Examinations in music (Prathama, Madhyama and Vidwat).This album, with 80 tracks, covers only the junior exam portions, while the other two will hit the market in six months. &#8220;The earnings from the CD sale will be donated to Ananya&#8217;s Arogyadhara health helpline extended to needy musicians,&#8221; says Nagamani.&#8220;Having gone through the initial grind with several gurus, I realise the importance of learner&#8217;s lessons,&#8221; she says, explaining the reason for the album. &#8220;Sangeetha Sadhane&#8221; will be handy for taking up the junior exams, but would be equally helpful to connoisseurs who want to follow a syllabus. Only Karnataka has devised courses with an enormous syllabus that covers the requirement of students in pursuing music with perfect grammar, she insists.The CDs contain lessons from sarale varase, janti, daatu, pillari, sanchari, alankara to lakshana geethe, jati swaras, varnas, devaranamas and krithis, each with an elaborate explanation in Kannada that is packaged with a booklet with theory and notations.Her mentor-disciple experiences? &#8220;Ramnad Krishnan was a musician who had a knack of determining that extra talent in each student. He would tap them, get students to highlight the positives, and be original. He would tell me that &#8216;brigas&#8217; were my strong point and had trained me to hone my delivery, and pace it in such a way that these adornments were an aural pleasure and not a disturbance to the sahitya.&#8221;In the same way, her guru would insist that when one takes up a raga for elaboration, the oscillation at the jeeva swara should determine the raga instantly&#8230; the gandhara of a Kalyani demands a treatment that would differ from gandhara of Mohana, he would say, although they are the same swara. This is where a prayoga is understood.He would insist that only diligent understanding of the nucleus of a raga would help a performer to meticulously handle a scale, otherwise the learned in the audience would wonder if it was Devagandhari or Arabhi; Natabhairavi or Saramati, since they are closely related ragas. &#8220;Only the initial lessons can give you a strong grounding in all these factors. S.L. Bhyrappa used to tell me onlysadhaneandchintanecan help one be creative!&#8221;There are scores of students with potential, but unfortunately they lack teachers who could lead them, she feels. &#8220;I am on a feverish mission to teach students in every nook and corner of Karnataka, since I live in Bangalore.&#8221;She also has audio-visual lessons on DVD recorded as in a gurukula system and conducts online classes. She can be contacted onnagamanisrinath@yahoo.com.
