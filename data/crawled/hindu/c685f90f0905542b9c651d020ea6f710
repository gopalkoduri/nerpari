VVocalist Visalakshi Nityanand&#8217;s concert in Palakkad  was good in parts. The positive features were the delectable portrayals of the ragas Hamsanaadham and Brindavanasaranga. She showcased her talent and skill in her delineations of the two ragas. She chose Uthukkadu Venkatasubba Iyer&#8217;s beautiful composition &#8216;Kalyana Raama&#8217; in Hamsanaadham and Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Soundararajam Asraye&#8217; in Brindavanasaranga and presented them with elegance. The imaginative kalpana swaras in Hamsanaadham were pleasing. The sloka preceding the Dikshitar kriti was moving and soulful.The alapana of Mohanam was marked by a few graceful sangathis. Being the main raga of the evening, one expected an in-depth treatment. Visalakshi rendered a Thiruppugazh song &#8216;Arumugham Arumugham&#8217; in kanda chapu tala, preceded by a Tamil virutham on Lord Muruga. The niraval at the phrase &#8216;Palanivazh Kumarane&#8217; and the innovative swaraprastharas offered variety.The rendering of the famous Tyagaraja kritis &#8216;Marugelara&#8217; in Jayanthasri and &#8216;Manavyalakim&#8217; in Nalinakaanthi was perfunctory. The Narayaneeya slokam &#8216;Yogeendranaam&#8217; in Yamunakalyani, followed by the popular song &#8216;Krishna Nee Begane&#8217; exuded aesthetic fervour. The Thillana of Uthukkadu Venkata Kavi in Sindhubhairavi was appealing.The initial phase of the concert, lacking in tempo and depth, had limited impact. The immortal pieces, the Bhairavi varnam &#8216;Viribhoni,&#8217; Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Vaatapi Ganapathim&#8217; in Hamsadhwani and the Thyagaraja Pancharatnam &#8216;Entharo Mahanubhavulu&#8217; in Sri raga, failed to click. Visalakshi&#8217;s voice also did not cooperate during this phase. Singing two prathimadhyama ragas &#8216;Hamsanaadham&#8217; and Panthuvarali (Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Shobhane&#8217;) in succession  sounded odd.S. Easwara Varma gave fine support on the violin. His raga essays were rich in melody. Young Ranjani Venkatesh impressed, with her deft and subtle touches on the mridangam. Along with R. Gopinatha Prabhu on the ghatam, she came out with an enjoyable thaniavarthnam in khanda chaapu tala.  The concert was organised  by The Palghat Fine Arts Society.
