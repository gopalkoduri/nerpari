VVIPULAMAmutham Music P Ltd.O.S ArunCarnatic &#8211; DVD &#8211; Price Rs. 399&#8216;Palisamma Muddu Sharade&#8217; in Sriranjani (Purandaradasa) is the opening number. The hand gestures and facial expressions of the vocalist match the structure of the sangathis in this composition. A few rounds of solfa passages are sung at &#8216;Sarvalankara Daya&#8217; which just pass muster. The absence of a manual tambura is glaring especially in a DVD recording.A folksy varnamettu is employed for the Mohanam number &#8216;Vadana Suhasyarasala&#8217; (Samartha Ramadasa). Arun&#8217;s brief vinyasa of Kalyanavasantham in the Hindustani genre is totally sruthi aligned and engages the attention of the listener. A Marathi abhang &#8216;Thoomaja&#8217; which follows is a spirited rendering.The pure Carnatic segment in this DVD is displayed in the few phrases of Bhairavi raga sung by Arun. The very brief alapana does not give any room to house Hindustani touches. A Bhadrachalam Ramadas composition in Eka tala (Tisra Nadai) &#8216;Alola Tulasi&#8217; is energetically vocalised. The percussionists enjoy Arun&#8217;s rendering and accompany with enthusiasm.A niraval like approach is adopted at the phrase &#8216;Kshirabdi Sayana.&#8217; The vocalist&#8217;s voice shows a definite strain in the upper register during this song rendition.The Brindavani alapana is done dramatically employing the usage of &#8216;Hari&#8217; for the exposition. Swati Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Chaliye&#8217; is the chosen number in Bridavani.The virutham on the Lord at Kadirgamam in Srilanka is sung as a prelude to the beautiful composition of Kavignar Vaali&#8217;s &#8216;Kooviazhaithaal&#8217; in Valaji which has been set to tune by Thanjavur S. Kalyanaraman. It is amusing to listen to Arun repeating the lyric &#8216;Kumara&#8217; over six  times at one stage of the virutham singing. Jayadeva&#8217;s &#8216;Nindati Chandana&#8217; (Darbari Kanada) is rendered with ease by the singer.  The continuity in the singing of this Ashtapathi takes a backseat due to the long gaps in between the verses.The DVD comes to a close with Saint Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Namo Namo Raghavaya,&#8217; which is believed to be the first composition of the Vaggeyakara. This song is normally sung in Desiya Thodi. Arun does the same though the inlay card mentions the same as Sindu Bhairavi. The accompanists are M.R. Gopinath (violin), A.V. Manikandan (mridangam), S. Ganapathi (tabla) and S. Selvam for timing.PVK
