VAthul Kumar, disciple of veteran flautist N. Ramani, has come up with an album of fusion music.Twenty-five year old Athul has been performing since his seventh year.Innovation caught his fancy quite early in his career and he has made the effort to learn music of other kinds as well."But never will I give up tradition. Any experiment I undertake will fall within the parameters of Carnatic music," he says."The idea is to globalise Carnatic music," he adds."The Wind &#151;  Instrumental Fusion" will be released on July 20, 6.15 p.m., at the Music Academy Mini Hall in the presence of his guru.The function on July 20 will be followed by a fusion concert presented by Athul Kumar (flute), Nirmal Felix (keyboard), Anand (guitar), Shankar Narayanan (mridangam) and Sowri Rajan (thavil and morsing).Bottom Template Starts
