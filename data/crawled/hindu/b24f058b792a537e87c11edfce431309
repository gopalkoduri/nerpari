VThirukkarugavur is situated on the banks of the river Vettar, a branch of the river Cauvery flowing in Thanjavur district.The presiding deity at the temple's sacred precincts is Lord Mullaivananathar (Lord of the Jasmine forest), and His divine Consort is Garbarakshambikai or Karu Kaatha Nayaki  -   one who bestows love and care on the mother and her unborn child during the months of her pregnancy.Sudha Ragunathan's audiocassette with songs that extol the goddess,  as its music director L. Krishnan whose contribution to devotional music is, is incomparable.Sindhubhairavi, Maand, Ahir Bhairav, Arabhi, Malayamarutham, Hindolam, Sankarabharanam, Ranjani, Brindavani, Bowli, Hamsanandi, Keeravani, Valaji and Surati are some of the pleasant melodies that have tunefully attired the lyrics. Vaarasri, the composer of the songs, deserves appreciation for the emotional and devotional substance in the sahitya.Sudha, as is customary, has sung the songs straight from the heart, reflecting a praiseworthy brand of professionalism.S.
