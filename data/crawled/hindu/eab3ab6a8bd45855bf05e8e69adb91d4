VJeyalakshmi, grand daughter of Muthiah Bhagavathar, spoke on &#8216;Rare and not yet popularised compositions of Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar&#8217;.  He was a pioneer in lec-dem and the first person to get a doctorate in music.She presented &#8216;Sannuthangi Sri Chamundeshwari&#8217; (daruvarnam in Vasantha), &#8216;Veda Mathe, Veda Vinuthe&#8217; (Nattai), &#8216;Yoginee Ganasevithe&#8217; (Bowli), &#8216;Mahavishnu Sodari&#8217; (Ananda bhairavi) and &#8216;Sathi Deviya Bhaji&#8217; (Shanmukhapriya), and many more compositions. She drew attention to the fact that Muthiah Bhagavathar&#8217;s compositions resemble the style of the trinities as he belonged to the post-trinity period. Her samples from Bhagavathar&#8217;s Chamundeshwari Ashtothra Keerthanas, &#8216;Jaya Mahishasura Mardini&#8217; (Hamsadhwani), &#8216;Ratna Kanchuka Dhaarini&#8217; (Khambodi)  and &#8216;Suganda Pushpa Bana Lasatkare&#8217; (Malayamarutham) were lovely and the musical lyrics packed with beauty.B.M.Sundaram&#8217;s lecture on the lesser-known kritis of the Thanjavur quartet, dealt with a lot of controversies regarding the authorship of many of the compositions attributed to them. The contribution of the four brothers &#8212; Chinnaiah, Ponniah, Sivanandam and Vadivelu &#8212; to the field of Carnatic music and dance has been voluminous as well as of excellent quality. They composed many varnams, javalis and kritis. Ponnaiah and Sivanandam remained in Serfoji&#8217;s court while Chinnaiah, the eldest, settled in Mysore (Wodeyar&#8217;s court) and the youngest Vadivelu flourished under the patronage of Swati Tirunal of the Travancore court. They take the credit for designing the &#8216;margam&#8217; beginning with alarippu and ending with tillana, followed in Bharatanatyam recitals today. Sisters Nithya and Vidya presented &#8216;Neevanti,&#8217; a  varnam in Kamalamanohari (Adi-Chinnaiah), &#8216;Vanajaksha Ninne&#8217; (Saveri-Kantajathi Ata talam-Vadivelu), &#8216;Mahadeva Manohari Sringari, Gowri&#8217; (Devamanohari-Ponnaiah), &#8216;Brihadeeswara Nammithira&#8217; (Varali-Ponnaiah) and &#8216;Mangalapradambulichu&#8217; (Madhyamavati -Sivanandam).  The lecture, based on extensive research, sure would have benefited students of music but the common rasikas certainly would have preferred a few more kritis.
