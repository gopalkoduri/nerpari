VThe piece de resistance of the seven-day music fete organised by Visakha Music Academy at Kalabharathi, was the awe inspiring recital of Carnatic music on violin by Dwaram Durga Prasada Rao. He is the grandson-cum-disciple of Dwaram Venkata Krishnaiah Naidu, guru of his elder brother of Kalaprapoorna Venkataswamy Naidu and son, the violin maestro Narasingarao Naidu (father of Prasada Rao). No wonder he evolved the recital as a flow of a spring of serene synthesis of profundity in Carnatic music and momentously nice attributes of euphony that the western instrument violin stands designed to harmoniously evolve.His brother Satyanarayana played complementarily on another violin in tandem with him, expertly supported by M.L.N. Raju on mridangam and S. Hanumantha Rao commensurably on ghatam. It seemed to be an effort of sublime genius which was revealed by achieving stress on key notes and chords of different ragas (accent) in slow, fast and superfast tempos, playing on more than one string at a time, plucking of strings instead of bowing (pizzicato), making the bow bump on the strings, dynamic change of intensity of sound from extreme loudness to superfine softness, polytonality, evolvement of upper partials like producing the effect of shadjam while touching the panchamam.His choice comprised Saveri varnam, Vinayaka ninu vina (Hamsadhwani), evocative elaboration of Manasa yetulorthune (Malayamaarutham) adorned with alapana, neravu and swaram, a composition in Ranjani, expansive expatiation of Krupaya paalayamam (Charukesi) followed by harmoniously executed thani by Raju and Hanumantha Rao.Haunting memoriesThe grand finale of the main part of the recital was the ragam (Kapi), thanam (Ragamalika Kapi, Pahadi and Revathi) and pallavi in Kapi in misratriputa concluded with swaram replete with expertly display of gathibhedam.The last two items in particular reflected reminiscences of the hauntingly memorable way his grandfather Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu evolved sublime nuances of Carnatic music in handling the bow and the figure board as two instruments. No wonder, he was chosen by the academy for presenting the first Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu Puraskar instituted by it recently to him.It was presented at the function held before the start of the recital. Playing of folk tunes like Appana Tanamanna, Orori bandivaada etc., constituted the tailpiece.
