VIt was more like a  dual treat. One on music and another on rhythm. Unnikrishnan and Varadarajan competed with each other on raga expansions and swara segments while Patri Satish Kumar and Karthick on mridangam and ghatam on the percussion front.The music and the beat blended enjoyably though it cannot be denied that at times both went over board. The raga essay of Vachaspathi was buoyant, as Unnikrishnan cruised  through the melodic phrases for Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Kanda Joodumi.&#8217; With the voice in fine form he built the &#8216;Alla Nadu Sowmithri&#8217; niraval supplemented by varying streams of swaras free flowing with myriad combinations.Varadarajan excelled in this segment in comparison to his response in the raga alapana. Earlier in the concert, Unnikrishnan impressed with &#8216;Jaya Jaya Swamin&#8217; of Narayana Tirtha with swaras and &#8216;Tulasidala&#8217; of Tyagaraja with swaras once again at &#8216;Saraseeruha Punnaga.&#8217;Bhairavi was unfolded with professional grace and ease. Unnikrishnan preferred to develop the treatise in slow and steady format dwelling more on the unique melody of Bhairavi and its delicate nuances. Karvais were in abundance and so were the akaras and brigas. Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Upacharamulanu&#8217; was rendered with devoutness, with an extended stopover at &#8216;Kapada Nataka Sutra.&#8217;Here, the niraval after the initial stages of sobriety leaped into significant dramatics touching the crescendo, drawing a thunderous applause.The kalpanaswaras threw light on  the innumerable permutation and computational technique of Unni in no uncertain terms. The famous prayogas in Bhairavi were used as refrain to conclude each string before moving on to the delectable rain of swaras focusing on panchamam.Varadarajan shared the glory with Unnikrishnan at every stage, impressing the singer and getting an appreciative nod from Unni for his imaginative rejoinders.Patri Satishkumar and Karthick vied with each other for the honour in the very lively, little noisy, more competent thani avartanam directing the sharp rhythmic sallies to a grand finale.&#8216;Saravana Bhava Guhane&#8217; in Kannada with swaras  and &#8216;Pibare Ramarasam&#8217; in Ahir Bhairav were in Unni&#8217;s schedule. The programme was held under the auspices  of Karthik Fine Arts at the Mylapore Fine Arts Club.
