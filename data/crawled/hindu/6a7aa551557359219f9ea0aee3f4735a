VIn her open voice rendition, she followed the well-chiselled, complicated Dhrupad patterns in a staid manner &#8212; a characteristic of the Gharana that has intricate chhand beat patterns that can be perfected when the voice is strong and deep &#8212; a style patronised by Alladia Khan Sahib and then by his successor Azizuddin Khan Sahib.Supporting her was Bhurji khan Sahib, guru of Pt. Waman Rao Sadolikar father and guru of Sruti Sadolikar.Besides her father, it was Ustad Gulubhai Jasdanwala who groomed her in the cultivated Jaipur Gayaki .&#8220;Presenting Jayat Shree&#8221; in madhya vilambit teen taal, &#8220;Jab te Piyoo&#8221; and &#8220;Bahut din beete&#8221; in teen taal dhrut, Sruti came up with remarkable  improvisations based on alankars repetitive note patterns, a language of phrases brought out in a pristine pure gayaki now gliding, now leaping.A traditional composition in Tilak Kamod Sur sangat raag vidya was beautifully presented with clear enunciations highlighting the significance of the musical structure in such a way that the libretto was not neglected. It had both literary value and melodic content.The piece formed a foundation for an elaborate musical edifice.The sangatis and the boltaans with a chosen line of the song were varied in rhythm and musical movement with well proportioned swara forms in Roopak.Sruti unfolded the shingara in Khamas filling the hour of joy with thrill and rapture. The treatment of the raga Khamas was indeed unique and special.Sruti was totally immersed in her rendition and lost no opportunity to applaud Ajay Joglekar who was in perfect sync with her on the harmonium.The piece in Bhairavi satisfied with the images  combining with the rasa of Holi.The Ustadana style of rendition, clear enunciations of even the the tivr swaras in Bhairavi in deep resonant voice was a singular experience. Mangesh Muley on the tabla enriched the recital.
