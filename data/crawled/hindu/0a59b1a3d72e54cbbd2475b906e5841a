VFour-and-half decades of dedication to music has finally been rewarded in the land of its origin. So it seems to Kanyakumari on receiving the Ugadi Puraskar. &#8220;Despite being honoured by the Madras Music Academy and the Sangeet Natak Academy with awards, I am extremely happy to be recognised by the Andhra Pradesh government as an artist of calibre,&#8221; says a beaming Kanyakumari, on being rewarded on the Telugu New Year.Very few know that this talented violinist belongs to a Telugu-speaking family of this state. She took to violin in Vizianagaram. &#8220;My father was in the police department then and he was very fond of music. My sisters evinced keen interest in vocal and were put under Sri Vijjeswara Rao who was running the Dwaram Narsinga Rao school then. None in the family then ever believed that I would be the one who would dedicate my life to music. It was guru Vijjeswara Rao who encouraged me and taught me the basics of violin. And I passed my diploma with distinction,&#8221; Kanyakumari recounts.There was no looking back since then. Armed with a degree in music, she approached M. Chandrasekharan . She is all praise for him for having shaped her destiny and of course M.L. Vasantha Kumari who inspired her to develop as a solo player with a style and technique of her own. &#8220;I accompanied MLV for 19 long years. After her, I used to accompany select musicians like Ramani. Later, I withdrew from being an accompanist as my sights were set at being solo violinist,&#8221; she pauses. What about Kadiri Gopalnath with whom she's always teamed?&#8220;I accompany Kadiri as I find a lot of scope as an individual violinist with him. He is a challenge. And together we are a &#8216;combo' being appreciated the world over,&#8221; she clarifies.The leading solo woman violinist in the country as of now, Kanyakumari has many a feather to her cap. Her deft bowing and swift touches have bestowed her with a &#8216;baani' (style) of her own which she willingly passes on to her pupils like Embaar Kannan and Prasanna (guitar). She loves to innovate. &#8220;In fact, I like to do something that nobody has attempted earlier. But it should gel with the classicist in me, &#8220;says the spirited violinist.Bold moveWhen fusion instrumental music was not even doing the rounds, Kanyakumari was bold enough to venture into a violin, nadaswaram, veena fusion concert way back in the late 80s. Her effort got her a pat on the back by none other than the famous Semmangudi. Buoyed by this, she started &#8216;Vaadya Lahari' and pioneered all women fusion instrumental concerts. She further experimented and emerged victorious with the &#8216; Tristhayi sangamam' . &#8220;We have three violins set to three octaves &#8212; one in the lower, second in sama and the third in taara (high). And when we bow, all the octaves are heard as if from a single instrument,&#8221; she explains. This harmonious blend of octaves was later released as Strings of Melody.With sitar artist Janardhan, she released ragas for peace and tranquillity aptly titled Prashantam. Not to be out beaten by the online trend that has caught on and is here to stay, Kanyakumari takes up online classes and has three VCDs to her credit for learners of violin beginning with the first alphabet of music, now on You Tube. Her greatest achievement was Shataraaga Maalika where composed a musical bonanza with 100 ragas spelt out on 100 different instruments merging in the pallavi. Her 25, 50 and 75 violins combo concerts were a great rage with violin lovers. Kanyakumari views this felicitation on her home ground to be the crowning glory of her long career.
