VPrakriti Foundation presented a programme by Sufi singer Mukhtiar Ali at the Alliance Francaise. Featured at World Music festivals and rapidly gaining renown, this vocalist hails from a Mirasi family in Bikaner (Rajasthan) whose traditional occupatio\u000an is singing. His style combines the Rajasthani folk idiom with Hindustani classicism and showcases the poetry of Kabir, Mira and Sufi poets.His commitment to the propagation of Sufi music extends far beyond performing engagements. He heads an organisation whose objectives include the consolidation of the Sufi genre by archiving available compositions and the encouragement of artists who take to this art form, by ensuring for them a sustainable livelihood.In Sufi heartland, the lyrics of saint-poet Kabit merit a special place. Kabir&#8217;s teachings and poems, though deceptively simple, hold a world of meaning for souls on a spiritual quest. The adopted child of a Muslim weaver family, he did not identify himself with any particular religion. Instead, his philosophy, influenced by prevailing tenets of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam expounded the oneness of humanity.The metaphors are simple yet profound, striking in their imagery, encompassing in their vision. Rooted in the vast spectrum of human emotional experience, they awaken the mind to an awareness of the ultimate truth.With Shabnam Virmani (whose docu-film about the singer and his craft was later screened) offering a spot translation in English, it became easier for all members of the audience to follow the emotional content in the couplets, highlighted by the music.The first few verses in a Megh Malhar-based composition employed a sawal-jawab lyrical device. Here Kabir asks, &#8220;Both my guru and God himself stand before me. Whose feet shall I touch?&#8221; The answer goes &#8220;I bow to my guru as it was he who showed me the way to God.&#8221;Kabir then muses on the irony that when we are born, we cry and the world laughs in joy at the sight of the newborn child, but when we die after a lifetime of good karma, we laugh and the world weeps in sadness at the passing of a noble soul. Kabir compares the life we are blessed with to an intricately-spun, wondrous body cloth. Wear it well, he says, and do not fall into doubt, for life passes by in a flash. The greatest souls, such as  Prahlad and Sudama are those who wore it with grace and surrendered it without a blemish.Yet another composition illustrated the simile of the bride (the soul) forced to part from her mother&#8217;s house (the body) by her husband (death) who has come to take her away to her marital home. The metaphor of the beloved Laila (God) seen through the eyes of Majnu (the devotee) found great favour with the audience who also identified with a similar view in a soothing &#8216;Ik Pal Chhain Na Aave, Sajna Tere Bina&#8217;.The line-up also included verses by Bulleh Shah, a great Sufi mystic who propounded universal truths.Winding up with the iconic &#8216;Allah Hu&#8217;, the artist carried the eclectic audience with him, his emotional intensity drawing them into a shared experience resonating with high-energy vibes. The skilled accompanists were Ashok Kumar (tabla), Shah Rukh (dholak), Fakhruddin (keyboards) and Allah Rakha (manjira).
