VA highlight  of the Sangeethotsavam was the vocal concert by Shengottai Harihara Subrahmaniam in which the verve and vigour of &#8216;Thamizhagam&#8217; bhaani swayed the audience.In a pattern evocative of the late Madurai Somasundaram, Shengottai tempered the mechanics of Carnatic music with chaste melody, resplendent inbhaavaandlaya. &#8216;Varavallabha Remanaa&#8217; in Hamsadhwani, with a lustrous &#8216;kalpanaswara&#8217; phase, ended up as a  tribute to GNB, the poet-composer.&#8216;Dinamani Vamsaa&#8217; is said to have been sung by Tyagaraja  at the conclusion of the regular Ekaadashi Bhajan. The vocalist  imbued the composition with appropriate mellowness and his &#8216;vidwath&#8217;, came to the fore when he subtly manipulated the arithmetic while  rendering the swaras.Rasikapriya, a difficult raga for exposition, was handled with finesse and &#8216;Smaraamyaham,&#8217; composed by his mentor and popular mridangist Sree Mushnam Raja Rao, got a round of applause.K.Viwanathan gave abundant support to the young vocalist.Veteran percussionist Gurvayur Dorai played the mridanagam with fine chiselled strokes, while P.N.Sudhir on the ghatom and Paravur Gopakumar on the &#8216;mukharsanghu&#8217; enhanced   the rhythmic grace of the concert.
