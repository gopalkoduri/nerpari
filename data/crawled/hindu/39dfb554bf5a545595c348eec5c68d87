VIn a bid to encourage young talent, Visakha Music and Dance Academy had recently organised a Carnatic vocal concert of Hyderabad-based musician M.J. Daniel at Kalabharathi auditorium, Vishakapatnam.A powerful yet melodic voice with a commitment to bhava is Daniel's forte.Opening the recital with a varnam in Abhogi, the vocalist proved his mettle with the centre piece in Sankarabharanam, a Deekshitar kriti Sankarachaaryam&#8230; wherein his alapana enveloped the dignified melakartha ragam in its full glory delving into the nuances with flourishes of brilliance.This vilambakala kriti was given its due dignity in devout tones even as Daniel touched the pinnacle with winding manodharma. The timber of the musician's voice and its reach along with the concurrent bhava came to the fore in Raghunayaka&#8230; in Abhogi and Nannu brovu Lalitha&#8230; in Lalitha ragam. The racy mridangam (G. Venkata Rao) and violin by M. Neeladri Rao revelled in technicalities which offset the emotive aspect of the vocalist.The &#8216;A' grade instrumentalists (Yedukondalu on ghatam) outwitted each other in display of virtuosity.Mohana ( Rama ninnu nammina varamu) was as eloquent as the raga. Aparadhamulu&#8230; in Latangi was handled with tender touch. Annamacharya's Bhavayami Gopala balam&#8230; a tarangam in Jhonpuri and the tillana in Jhunjhuti were choicest melodies that rounded off the recital.Under the tutelage of D. Raghavachari (Hyderabad Brothers), Daniel has picked up his guru's preference to bhava and sahitya and had imparted the same to his rendition.
