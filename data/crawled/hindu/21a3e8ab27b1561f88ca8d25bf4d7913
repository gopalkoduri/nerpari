VIt was a felicitation with a difference. A series of nagaswaram concerts by noted vidwans through the day was a treat for the audience which concluded around midnight.The Kalaignar Marriage Hall in Tiruchi city reverberated with concerts by a batch of about 20 vidwans to the accompaniment of five thavil artists.This musical felicitation to the Clarionet maestro, A.K.C. Natarajan, in recognition of the title &#8216;Sangita Kalanidhi&#8217; conferred on him recently, in a way marked a real honour to the artist who was patted as &#8216;Clarionet Everest&#8217; by the late Rajarathinam Pillai.It was 11.30 p.m. when the Tirupambaram Brothers &#8212; T. K. S. Swaminathan and T.K.S. Meenakshisundaram &#8212; to the accompaniment of five thavil artists, ended up their hour-long concert which marked the special session and valediction of the felicitation.&#8220;To honour the Clarionet Everest, our hour-long concert is too small. In fact, we wanted to play on for a few more hours,&#8221; observed Swaminathan.Commencing with a  Tyagaraja kriti they rendered an  alapana for  the next kirtana, &#8216;Manju Samayamuraa.&#8217;A few songs by B.M. Sundaram including &#8216;Naanamaa&#8217; in Maandu ragam were also equally impressive.The concert concluded with Thiruppugazh. The thani avarthanam by the thavil artists - Tiruvalapathur T.A. Kaliyamurthy, Thanjavur T.R. Govindarajan, Kovilur K.G. Kalyanasundaram, Irumbavanam Kannan and Tirurameswaram T.B. Radhakrishnan - was a real treat for the audience. They exhibited both their precision in performance and consonance in thalam which kept the audience spell-bound all through.
