VWhile the veterans were busy giving concerts at various sabhas, the veterans-to-be did not lag behind. Thanks to Ramjhi's Isai Mazhalai, 77 children in the age group four to 16 years, are undergoing training in music - both vocal and instrumental. Some have acquired proficiency to perform on the stage. Under the auspices of Radhu's Drama Academy and Priya Vision, daily one-hour programmes have been organised.The opening concert was by 12-year-old S. Adityanarayanan. He is a disciple of Suguna Varadachari. He was accompanied on the violin by Sraddha Raveendran (disciple of Radha Sundaresan) and on the mridangam by Master Akshay Ram (disciple of Umayalpuram Sivaraman.)Wearing an angavasthram, Adityanarayanan commenced his concert in style with a Kadhanakuthuhalam varnam. He established his credentials through this rendering. He delineated Dhanyasi, showing extraordinary ability in sustaining at different notes. The alapana on the violin was also equally absorbing.Tyagaraja's &#8216;Syamasundaranga' in Rupaka tala was rendered at a slow pace with the intrinsic charm of the raga highlighted. The swaraprastaras by both were much more than what would normally be expected from &#8216;child' artists.The Khambodi alapana and rendering of the kriti &#8216;Majanaki' proved the maturity of the trio. Niraval and swaras were at &#8216;Rajaraja.' The thani by Akshay Ram was exquisite and it is no exaggeration.Adityanarayanan wound up his concert with an abhang. After the concert, one felt as if one were enjoying the performance of an accomplished singer.
