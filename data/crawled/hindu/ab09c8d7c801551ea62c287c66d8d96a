V&#8220;Barkha Ritu&#8221;, a unique Hindustani classical music festival organised by Banyan Tree during the monsoon season every year in Bangalore has never failed to enrapture the cognoscenti .This year's festival was a veritable musical rainstorm that galvanised the listeners with the scintillating performances of two of the prominent artistes in the contemporary world of Hindustani classical music : Pandit Sanjeev Abhyankar and Ustad Shahid Parvez Khan .Pandit Sanjeev Abhyankar, commenced his vocal recital with Raga Miyan Ki Malhar, the most popular monsoon raga known for its myriad creative manifestations in popular music as well. Abhyankar's delineation of the slow paced vilambit bandish &#8220;Piharwa aaj hu na aye&#8221; in ektal, a rhythmic cycle of 12 beats was an exquisite exploration of this majestic raga through the concatenation of meditative alap, bol-alap, and bewitching sargams that evolved into a panoramic spectacle of this complex raga. Abhyankar's presentation was a pleasing amalgamation of erudition coupled with passionate feeling. Ravindra Katoti on the harmonium accentuated the romantic appeal of this raga. The chota khayal bandish &#8220;Barsan Lagiri&#8221; in the fast-paced drut teental of 16 beats was marked by awe inspiring taankari. Pt. Ravindra Yavagal on the tabla ensnared the audience with his delightfully swift, crisp tihais and alluring phrases.Pandit Abhyankar chose another beautiful monsoon melody Megh. His rendition of the bandish in vilambit roopak tal of seven beats , &#8220;Manwa nahi Manat&#8221; followed by the drut teental composition &#8220;Dar lage mohe damini ko&#8221; and the drut ektal composition &#8220;Umand umand gan garaje&#8221; were marked by stupendous gamak taans that almost took one's breath away.The next artiste of the evening was Ustad Shahid Parvez Khan, one of India's most celebrated instrumentalists. Ustad Shahid Parvez was given a standing ovation by the audience who had eagerly waited for his sitar recital with a great sense of excitement. Ustad Parvez rose to the expectations of the connoisseurs and enthralled the audience with a rich fare of Malhar prakar ragas and thumris. Ustad Shahid Parvez began his recital with raga Megh Malhar, a derivative of the raga Megh. His delineation of the three-tired alap-jod-jhala distinguished by delicate and subtle &#8220;meends&#8221; had a caressive impact upon the listeners. His rendition of the gat composition in ektal which was followed by adha teental and a resonant climax in the drut ektal was remarkable for innumerable dulcet phraseologies and incredible sense of layakari and velocity that was at the same time infallible. It was truly an enchanting experience to watch the tabla maestro Pt. Ramdas Palsule who gracefully initiated a wonderful, creative dialogue between the sitar and tabla culminating in an extraordinary symphony.Ustad Shahid Parvez concluded his recital with a lilting thumri in raga Bhairavi, which was an exemplary demonstration of the salient features of the gayaki ang in sitar recital.
