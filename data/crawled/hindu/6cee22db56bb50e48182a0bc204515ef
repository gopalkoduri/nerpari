VIt was with remarkable prowess on the violin that the young pair Ranjani and Gayathri, from Mumbai, made their impact in the Chennai concert scene several years ago. Chennai, in typical fashion, adopted them and soon they were the most sought after accompanists. Alternating between violin duets and accompanying, the duo grew in stature and along the way, took their plunge into the vocal scene, where the rise has been even faster. So much so that their violin recitals have become a rarity.Nostalgic tripThus their violin concert was welcome and kindled nostalgia. The duo transported the audience to a zone of tranquillity. The execution of &#8216;Mamavasadha Janani' (Kanada-Rupakam-Swati) indicated the mood and form. One of them straying into the mandhara string now and then made a terrific impact. An unhurried alapana of Chakravaham by Ranjani proved that they had internalised the music. The pauses were soothing like a gentle breeze and the landings were akin to the clouds coming to rest on peaks. &#8216;Sugunamulay Cheppukonti' (Rupakam-Tyagaraja) blossomed with fragrance. The seasoned campaigners Manoj Siva (mridangam) and N. Guruprasad (ghatam) kept up the tempo with their unobtrusive playing.One sore point was the high volume of the right side of Siva's mridangam -- not his fault though. The sound engineer did not stir even after word was sent through the volunteers. It is time sabhas shifted their sound management systems to the stereo centre on the back wall for correct judgment.The essence of Anandabhairavi was captured in two minutes by Gayathri followed by Syama Sastri's &#8216;Mari Wayray Gati' that was bliss. Gayathri then went to build an edifice of Mohanam with tonal support from her elder sister. It was as though phrases were just waiting to be tapped.Merging with the instrument Gayathri' raga alapana was a meditator's delight. Tyagaraja's &#8216;Nannu Palimpa,' the duo's favourite was in for a grand treatment laced with simple swaras redolent with the raga's flavour. Manoj and Guruprasad involved in lively exchanges during the thani phase. Patnam Subramania Iyer's &#8216;Raghuvamsasudha'(Kadhanakudhuhalam), a favourite of the late Chittibabu.The ragam and tanam in Shanmukhapriya shared by the siblings like in a relay, with podi sangathis and evocative sancharas led to a pallavi in chatusra jathi jampa talam (kanda nadai). The ragamalika flurry included Sahana, Vasantha and Maand. On the whole, a concert for the soul.
