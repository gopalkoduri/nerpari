VThe concert, which started on a sober note with a Nalinakanti varnam composed by Lalgudi Jayaraman, had a brisk run in the swaras. This was followed by the Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Sidhivinayakam&#8217; in Shanmukhapriya in which he played the swaras in rapid successions.Ambujam Krishna&#8217;s composition &#8216;Guruvayoorappane&#8217; was the next piece. Srinivas brought forth the spirit of the raga as he started the piece on the upper gandhara. &#8216;Krupaya paalaya&#8217; had a  leisurely neraval in misra chappu. The swaras  matched the grandeur of the neraval.Cherthala Ananathakrishnan provided excellent support on the mridangam. A request from the audience had Srinivas playing &#8216;Raghuvamswsudhambudhi.&#8217; This popular piece with a Western feel to it,  saw the artiste playing multiple octaves simultaneously. Keeravani alaapana had a systematic progression that gave emphasis to each note. The sporadic gamakas, which were highlighted with soft tonal effects, were iridescent with dexterity and fervour.Chandramouli, on the violin, lent the composition tonal quality while Srinivas gave a skittish quality to the piece by jumping to distant notes at quick succession during the swara sequence.Unnikrishnan, on the ghatom, excelled in the thaniyavarthanam. &#8216;Jagadodharana,&#8217; in Kapi, &#8216;Govinda bolo&#8217; in Ahir Misra bhairavi,  &#8216;Chandrasekhara&#8217; in Sindhubhairavi and the Dhanashri tillana brought the concert to a close.It was organised by Kerala Fine Arts Society.
