VPlayback singer and Carnatic vocalist P. Unnikrishnan&#8217;s concert on the second day was the  main attraction. Unnikrishnan was trained in Carnatic music by stalwarts like V.L. Seshadri, S. Ramanathan, T. Brinda, Savitri Satyamurthy, Calcutta Krishnamurthy and P. S. Narayanaswamy.He started the concert with  &#8216;Varalendukommani&#8217; in Gurjari raga, set to Adi tala. It was followed by  &#8216;Karuna yelagante&#8217; in Varali, set to  Adi tala. He elaborated the song with ragaalapanam, niraval and manodharma swaras. The magnificent raga touched the listeners.The main piece of the evening was &#8216;Naadaloludai,&#8217; a melodious composition in Kalyana vasantham. Although the raga is not often heard in concerts and it is not a popular one in evening concerts, the audience welcomed it with  applause.However, due to paucity of time,  the audience missed the opportunity to listen to a Thaniyaavarthanam by eminent  percussionist  Guruvayur Dorai, who had accompanied Unnikrishnan.  S.V.S.N. Viswanathan was on the ghatam and V.V. Suresh on the violin.Unnikrishnan continued the concert with the popular song &#8216;Upacharamulanu&#8217; in Bhairavi. Although the organisers seemed to  in a hurry to wind up the concert and go on to the next musician,  he managed to sing Niraval. He concluded with the piece &#8216;Oh Rama Rama&#8217; in Nagagaandhari.
