VA. SANGAMESWARANPanthula Rema's vocal recital at Guruvayur mostly comprised kritis on Lord Krishna. Beginning the concert with a rare Ganapathi kriti `Gajavadanamasraye' by N.C.H. Krishnamachari, in raga Kedaram, she embellished it with briskkalapanaswaras.This was followed by `Gopalakapaahimam' (Revagupthi), `Chethasree' (Dwijavanthi) and `Brovabharama' (Bahudari). She chose raga Saraswathi for a detailedalapana, gliding through its subtlesancharas,smoothly and effectively bringing out its details before singing the krithi `Anuraagamuleni' by Saint Thyagaraja. `Karunacheivan' was sung next in Sree ragam.A neat, unhurried delineation of raga Bhairavi followed, her voice now settled, negotiating every twist and turn of the raga with proper emphasis on characteristic phrases.The kriti chosen  -   `Baalagopala' of Dikshithar  -   also synchronized with thealaapana,accentuating the beauty of the raga, which was adorned with neraval andkalpanaswaras.M.S. Narasimhamoorthy accompanied on the violin. With his remarkable bowing technique, tonal quality and grip over the instrument, he ably backed the artiste.V. Ramanamoorthy on the mridangam embellished the concert with his controlled and appropriate rhythmic patterns. Govindaprasad was on the mukharsankh.The fag end of the concert comprised `Bhogeendrasayinam' (Kunthalavarali) of Swati Tirunal, a melting `Bhavayami Gopalabaalam' (Yamuna Kalyani) evoking the memory of the legendary M.S., a `Narayanatheertha tharangam,' `Krishnam Kalaya sakhi' (Mukhari) and mangalam by saint Thyagaraja in Surutti.Bottom Template Starts
