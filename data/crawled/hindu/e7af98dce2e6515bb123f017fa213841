He was accompanied on the tabla by his equally talented brother Shubhadarshan Biswal.An evening of OdissiMohapatra Minati Bhanja, a seasoned singer of Odissi began the proceedings of the evening by presentingraag Mukhari. She went on to render Banamali's well-known songBata chhada suhata nagara. Her husband Jagannath Kuanr accompanied her on the pakhauj. After Biswal's violin recital, it was the turn of the ace Odissi dancer and actor Mohini Sheilalipi to take the stage. Her first item was a pure dance piecePallavi.
