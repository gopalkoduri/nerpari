VThe  duo cast a magic spell over the audience with  immaculate handling of their  musical instruments and with an at-length exposition in raga Yaman with its Carnatic counterpart, raga Kalyani. These ragas are the two most important melodies of the two music systems belonging to the North and the South of the country.Prateek commenced his recital with an elaborate and a highly reposeful &#8216;alap-jod&#8217;. There was a wee bit confusion in what seemed to be his attempt to give raga Yaman a touch of raga Yaman Kalyan. He tried to give a touch of the note Suddha Madhya that has to be inserted in a very special manner, with a slight touch like a very tiny mole on a fair and beautiful face.However, the recital thereafter continued to remain flawless and even highly appealing. One felt impressed with his plucking of the sitar strings and his compact movements over the frets that had the touch of his Dada Guru, the late Ustad Mushtaq Ali Khan. There were quite a few  sparkling permutations in his &#8216;jod-jhala&#8217; renderings.Prateek did well to restrict the &#8216;gat-toda&#8217; renderings in  raga Yaman and well displayed his good grasp over the rhythm by first playing a slow tempo 16  beat &#8216;Masitkhani gat&#8217; followed by another in the 12  beat fast Ek tala and a super-fast Teen tal composition that came as a scintillating finale to the occasion.High praises are due to the young percussionist, Akram Khan for his excellent accompaniment with his precisely tuned tables besides the several rounds of his own highly intricate and beautifully executed sequences of solo variations.
