VThe Bharat Sangeet Utsav 2010 organised by Carnatica saw several senior artists give their best, in Coimbatore, recently.With his voice now in absolute control, Ashok Ramani's kutcheri was a memorable one. Sri Vatapi (Sahana) set the pace for the evening. Papanasam Sivan's &#8216;Ini Oru Kanam' (Sriranjani) come next with swaras and inspired the accompanists to give their best.His alapana of Natabhairavi (&#8216;Sri Valli Devasenapathe') and the niraval and kalpanaswaras revealed his vidwat. Sivan's praise of the Sankarankoil deity in the kriti &#8216;Gomathi Thaaye' in Yadukulakhambodi, was presented with effortless ease.Thodi was the main piece, the kriti being &#8216;Kartikeya Gangeya'. It was sketched with telling phrases in an invigorating pace.The artist's explanation of Sivan's compositions at the beginning was absorbing. Charulatha's supportive role on the violin and Sudhindra's rhythmic beats on the mridangam added dignity to the recital.The jugalbandi concert of Sriram Parasuram and Anuradha Sriram with Viji Anand (violin), Sudhindra (mridangam), Umakanth (harmonium) and Ravindra (tabla) was underscored by sheer melody, artistry and rhythmic excellence. The Hindustani Sahana sung in praise of Allah is similar to Carnatic Sahana, but with a small change in gandharam. To illustrate this, Sriram presented &#8216;Karunimpa' (Sahana) traversing the octaves in full -throated ease, setting the right mood.Perfect alignmentAnuradha's melodious voice negotiated the musical phrases in perfect alignment and showcased her enthusiasm and confidence in maintaining the rhythm. Sriram's rendition of &#8216;Pitha Piraisudi' was reflective of the philosophical content of the song. &#8216;Krishna Nee Begane' and the thumri &#8216;Savare Jayo' by the duo alternately bringing out the contrast in the two styles, drew appreciation among the rasikas.&#8216;Marukelara' (Jayantasri) embellished with swaras was another display of artistry. Anuradha's forays in the higher reaches were commendable. Vijay Anand's violin accompaniment revealed dexterous fingering techniques. Sudhindra (mridangam) and Ravindra (tabla) provided power-packed tani.Maharajapuram Ramachandran, in his heart-warming concert, displayed a natural flow of musical expression, sans frills and affectation. After a reposeful interpretation of &#8216;Maha Ganapathim,' his alapanas of Hindolam, Dhanyasi and Kalyani were inspiring. The kriti, &#8216;Entuku Nee Manasu' (Kalyani) was rendered with aplomb.Muralidharan (violin), Ramesh (mridangam) and Purushothaman (ganjira) were the accompanists. Barring swara slippages now and then, it was an average recital.Years of asura sadhakam have enabled the talented duo Ranjani and Gayathri to internalise the charms of melody in their kutcheris.Guided by intuitive perception, the siblings have taken their music to great heights to create the sahrudaya in the listeners. The opening Durbar varnam &#8211; &#8216;Chalamela' -- followed by &#8216;Merusaman' with swaras set the session on the right keel. Ranjani's alapana of Saranga for &#8216;Arunachala' and Gayathri's raga alapana of Thodi were mapped out with incredible pidis in the tara sthayi. &#8216;Aadum Chidambaramo' was lucid.The flow of vocal felicity in the concluding abhang capped it all. Gopinath's fingering prowess on the violin was at its best in raga sancharas.Sairam (mridangam) and Purushothaman (ganjira) were at ease with the performing styles of the artists.T.N. Krishnan's enchanting solo violin recital was -- succinctly put -- creativity based on melody. That his violin speaks is an understatement. It was a pleasure to listen to him play. Establishing his expertise with &#8216;Maha Ganapathim' and &#8216;Evarani,' his delineations of Pantuvarali for &#8216;Siva Sivaenaradha' and Abheri for &#8216;Nagumomu' were majestic.The Thodi alapana was a picture of elegance casting a spell on the rasikas. &#8216;Thaye Yasodha' with niraval and swaras had the touch of sukham. Guruvayur Durai (mridangam) and Purushothaman (ganjira) gave an exhilarating thani.
