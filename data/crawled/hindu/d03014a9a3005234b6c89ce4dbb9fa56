His  scholarly concert portrayed the essence of the ragas, evoking the subtleties of bhava in brief and exquisite alapanas.His concert, organised in connection with the inauguration of the Golden Jubilee Memorial Concert Hall of the Music Department, Government College, Chittur, showcased his  vibrant voice.The concert was pepped with brigas and rendition of ragas and kritis based on both lakhsya and lakhshana.Thiruvizha Viju S. Anand, on the violin and Kuzhalmannam Ramakrishnan on the mridangam provided adequate support. A mellifluous alapana of Hamsadhwani for the  Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Vathapi Ganapathim Bhajeham,&#8217; set to Adi tala, was adorned with cascading manodharmaswaras in two speeds.&#8216;Sivakamasundari&#8217; in raga Jaganmohini, set to Roopaka tala, a Gopalakrishna Bharathi composition, was laced with kalpanaswaras.  An erudite rendition of raga Hindolam was  suffused in raga bhava and  melody.Viju ably complemented the vocalist on the violin.&#8216;Samaganalolane,&#8217; a  composition of Papanasam Sivan, was enriched with swaraksharas,  rhythmic chittaswaras and  brilliant swarakalpanas.  Kuzhalmannam Ramakrishnan&#8217;s thani stood out with his firm strokes on the mridangam.A Tyagaraja composition in Bindumalini, &#8216;Entha muddo,&#8217;  set to Adi tala, was followed by a melodious alapana of Kapi.Ganesan concluded the concert with a power packed presentation of two compositions of Papanasam Sivan &#8211;&#8216;Ramanai bhajithal&#8217; in Mandu and &#8216;Kumaran thal paninthenadi&#8217; in Kamboji, and Mangalam.
