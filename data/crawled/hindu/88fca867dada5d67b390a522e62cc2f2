VThe well attended 11th anniversary concerts of Sruthi Arts Academy, conducted recently at TVS Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Madurai, began with a brisk rendering of the Darbar varnam &#8216;Chalamela&#8217; by Nithyashree Mahadevan. Her sing\u000aing was brigha-filled and good attempts were made at bringing out the flavours of ragas such as Mohanam, Kalyani and Saveri.The main alapana in Hindolam was a combination of kalpana and kalpita swaras and the audience sighed in recognition when she launched into Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Samajavara Gamana.&#8217; What made her short pieces in Tamil very enjoyable was her clear pronunciation.  M.A. Krishnaswamy supported her ably on the violin, while I. Shivakumar on the mridangam and Alathur Rajaganesh on the ganjira coordinated well to provide rhythm.Unnikrishnan began on a light vein with the Saveri varnam &#8216;Sarasuda.&#8217; His &#8216;Sivalokanadanai&#8217; by Gopalakrishna Bharathi in Mayamalava Gowla was more sensual than rhythmic with the singer lingering on the swarasthanas and bringing out their essence rather than on the enunciation of the lyrics.Effort, expertise and enthusiasm characterised his long alapana in Purvikalyani, which was sung as a prelude to &#8216;Parama Pavana&#8217; and the audience responded with energetic applause all through. Ramanujacharyulu echoed his phrases with ease and B. Harikumar on the mridangam and Mohanram on the ghatam entertained the audience with their resonant jatis.Sanjay Subramanyam set the concert at a fast pace with Milu Krishnayyar&#8217;s &#8216;Dayapayonidhe&#8217; in Jaganmohini. S. Varadharajan on the violin gave able support,  from the plaintive strains of Thodi to the quick gait of Begada. Sanjay inspired piety through Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Thanigai Valar&#8217; and then evoked smiles with his playful cadences in the song, &#8216;Innum Paaramugam.&#8217; The percussionist Neyveli Venkatesh found his role to be a challenging one as Sanjay improvised on the notes by singing them in all three speeds within the same avartanam. The audience was as unstinting in their applause as the singer was unrelenting in his efforts to delight them.The pleasure of listening to the next day&#8217;s concert was considerably enhanced by Sangeeta Sivakumar&#8217;s distinct enunciation of well known lyrics such as Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Brovabharama&#8217; in Bahudari, Gopalakrishna Bharathi&#8217;s &#8216;Ayye Metha Kadinam&#8217; in Punnagavarali and Kannan Iyengar&#8217;s &#8216;Aarumo Aaval&#8217; in Maand. Her sojourn through the octaves of Varali before she started &#8216;Maamava Meenakshi&#8217; and of Bhairavi before Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Upacharamulu&#8217; satisfied the listeners. Her kalpanaswaras were lively. The accompanists R.K. Shriram Kumar on the violin, B. Sivaraman on the mridangam and Alathur Rajaganesh on the ganjira played with involvement.The final concert by veteran O.S. Tyagarajan saw a full house despite the rain. The singer chose popular ragas and much favoured lyrics such as Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Tatvamariya&#8217; in Ritigowla and Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Paridana&#8217; in Bilahari with effortless ease and flawless finish. The alapana in Purvikalyani was exemplary and was followed by the song &#8216;Padmavathi Ramanan.&#8217; Upon request from a rasika, he rendered  &#8216;Lavanya Rama.&#8217;  The ragam tanam sung with the pallavi &#8216;Kanaga Sabesan&#8217; was original and handled with maturity.Delhi P. Sundararajan provided respite to the singer with his support on the violin and S. Tyagarajan on the mridangam adroitly shifted from one speed to another.
