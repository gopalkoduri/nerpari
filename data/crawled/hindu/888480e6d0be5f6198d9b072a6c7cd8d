VIn recent times, there seems to have been a  significant  shift in T. M. Krishna&#8217;s singing from sparkling spontaneity of his early years to a studied  lethargic technique in recent times.  A  proof of this was his concert for Nadopasana &#8212;\u000a especially in the alapana of Atana in the beginning of the concert and Bhairavi midway.The way he built up Atana vinyasa  suggested that he wanted to show  the rasikas how the conventional face of five-minute-luminous Atana would look like when stretched to  20 minutes.  It stayed on a note, was hurled suddenly, gained repose again, was twisted with a sanchara to the tara sthayi and ended with a safe landing at the tara shadja. In contrast, the kirtana &#8216;Ee Paapamu Jesitira&#8217; was spurred to a race-course gallop with twenty-odd sparkling sangatis. In the process, the penitent confessional sentiment of the kirtana humbly bowed to the dictates of professional performance objective. It was more than enough to satisfy rasika infatuation and Krishna  gained his purpose.The programme began with the Kedaragowla song &#8216;Venuganaloluni&#8217;, quite composed and well interpreted. The second item &#8216;Nannu Brochutaku&#8217; (Thodi) of Subbaraya Sastri was equally poised. It was then that the navigational direction changed to Atana and led to Bhairavi.Based on his present performing style, smooth and confident, Krishna presented Bhairavi to get it integrated with the demands of the recital. One pertinent aspect was that the alapana proceedings never suggested a state of tension between his manodharma and vocal ability. There was fluency in sancharas with cadences marked by a rich tapestry of rakti passages. With all these favourable factors, the inconsistency in the uniformity of tempo in the recital as a whole had to be acknowledged.The choice of the swarajati &#8216;Kamakshi Amba&#8217; was appropriate to the quality of the alapana. There was depth and serenity in the exposition of this item. The simple devotional flavour of the piece was all absorbing as Krishna sang. However,  his niraval and swaras at &#8216;Bhaktha Jana Kalpalathika&#8217; seemed inappropriate.Talking of niraval and swaraprasthara, they form the sheet anchor of Krishna&#8217;s hold over the rasikas. The pressure-packed fullness of contrived enchantment of these two was meant to cast a spell of intoxication on the listeners, and it did.The violinist was M.R. Gopinath. Though there were no demonstrative highlights in his solo versions of the ragas, the sense of competence stemmed from the compositional quality of the alapanas. There was an easy grace that lighted up the essential aspect of his play.T.V. Vasan, mridangam accompanist, and A.S. Shankar (ghatam) guided their laya technique carefully without disturbing the creative process of the vocalist, while supporting the song session. The most distinguishing feature of the whole recital was the five-minute tani, something one does not come across generally. Poise and propriety spoke of their laya stature.
