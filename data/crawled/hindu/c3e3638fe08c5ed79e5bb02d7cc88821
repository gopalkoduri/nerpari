VA distinct element of almost all compositions of Dikshitar is the wonderful images he projects of the power, benevolence and beauty of various Gods and Goddesses, with eloquent expressions in Sanskrit, thus enabling listeners to indulge in devotional contemplation. By contrast, the predominant element of Tyagaraja's compositions is strong emotion rather than pure meditation, though some of his songs have a Dikshitar-like perspective.Fine selectionBy lining up a couple of Tyagaraja kritis alongside three Dikshitar songs, and adding a Syama Sastri composition, Maharajapuram Srinivasan took a large and attentive audience at Hamsadhwani on an intensely meditative and visual musical experience.The fine selection of songs consisted of Dikshitar's &#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam' (Shanmukhapriya), &#8216;Nandagopala' (Yamunakalyani), and &#8216;Sri Krishnam Bhaja' (Thodi)'; Tyagaraja's &#8216;Evarichirira' (Madhyamavati) and &#8216;Gaanamurthe' (Ganamurthi); and Syama Sastri's &#8216;Mayamma' (Ahiri). There were substantial raga alapanas of Thodi and Madhyamavati, and superb niravals and kalpanaswaras for every song. To provide relief, Srinivasan rendered an intricate and attractive ragamalika song composed by Cuddalore Subramanyam (featuring a breathtaking succession of more than 20 ragas in a row, each delivered in half an avartanam!).Excellent accompaniment was provided by V.V. Ravi on the violin, Neyveli Narayanan on the mridangam and Venkatramanan on the ganjira. And accompanying the singer vocally with great restraint was his son Ganesh Viswanathan.
