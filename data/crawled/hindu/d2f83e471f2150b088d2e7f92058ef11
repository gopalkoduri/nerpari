VO.S.Arun, a singer with a facile, sruthi-aligned voice is a versatile artist.Being equally adept in  both the classical systems of Indian music, his rendering of bhajans and other devotional compositions are looked forward to by rasikas in his concerts.Amutham Music P. Ltd has come out with a compact disc titled &#8216;Evergreen Bhajans&#8217; in which Arun has rendered a dozen compositions of various composers.&#8216;Bagyadha Lakshmi Baramma&#8217; of Purandaradasa is the opening number. This is one of the best known compositions of the jeweller turned saint. Arun&#8217;s version is in a very pleasing Pantuvarali as per the inlay card though with a generous leaning towards Purya Dhanasree which is the Hindustani counterpart of Pantuvarali. The effortless ease with which the vocalist&#8217;s voice traverses through the three  octaves is a result of the &#8216;Saadhakam&#8217; put in. A composition of D.K. Pattammal &#8216;Janani Krupa&#8217; in Sindhubhairavi follows in which the supporting artists who provide the chorus for this number as well as for the Swami Haridas creation &#8216;Narayana&#8217; in Darbari Kaanada, have done their tasks in an admirable fashion.Nostalgic memories of D. B. Paluskar creep in while listening to Arun singing his favourites such as  &#8216;Tumak Chalata&#8217; ( Mishra Pahadi-Tulsidas ) and &#8216;Payoji Maine&#8217; (Behag-Meera). &#8216;Kandavarkum Kanavilun&#8217; in Kuntalavarali is spiritedly vocalised which is a composition of Chidambaram Swarna Venkatesa Dikshitar (The inlay card reads as Chidambaram Dikshitar).The late K. V. Narayanaswamy&#8217;s repertoire included this bright composition. Arun renders Sadashiva Brahmendra&#8217;s &#8216;Gaayathi Vanamali&#8217; in Hamsadhwani in Madhyama sruthi. The enchanting music set for this piece is the brain child of M.Balamuralikrishna.The vocalist&#8217;s rendition of this song is fascinating. &#8216;Jagadodharana&#8217; (Misra Kapi- Purandaradasa), &#8216;Mere Tho Giridhar&#8217; (Behag-Meera) and a traditional Tamizh composition &#8216;Ninaikada Neramillai&#8217; (Ragesri) prefaced with a virutham on Muruga follow, all of which makes for a very pleasant listening.The popular verse &#8216;Poojyaya Raghavendraya&#8217; and the equally popular &#8216;Thunga Theere Viraajam&#8217; (Salakha Bhairavi) are tellingly effective renditions. This composition is wrongly attributed to Tulsidas in the inlay card whereas it is the creation of one of the Dasakuta composers.Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Karpagame&#8217; in Madhyamavathi, which is the perennial favourite with Carnatic musicians,  is convincingly sung towards the close of this album.A little more care in the pronunciation of certain words in this song would have added on to the effective vocalisation by the artist. The accompanists are Mullaivasal Chandramouli (violin), Kuldeep Pai (Harmonium), J.Vaidyanathan (mridangam), S.D. Ganapathi (tabla ) and Selvam (percussion support).Amutham Music Pvt.
