VUhooroo is committed to support Indian music in all its forms &#8211; classical through independent pop and rock music.Uhooroo.com provides a platform for Indian musicians to showcase their talent, get feedback from the community, collaborate with other independent musicians and find an audience that is interested in their art form. It was founded by Bharath Madhusudan and Vinay Mahadik &#8211; information security researchers in Silicon Valley, California.The inspiration for Uhooroo came from Vinay&#8217;s experience as an amateur musician. He wanted to get feedback on his vocals and electronica mixes and could not find a web-based community that offered the kind of feedback and cultural identity that he was looking for as an Indian musician.Uhooroo is committed to support Indian music in all its forms &#8211; classical through independent pop and rock music.The value that Uhooroo provides to the Indian Music Community is best summarised in the words of Teed Rockwell &#8211; a Berkeley, California-based Hindustani musician and critic &#8211; &#8220;When I first started studying Indian Music, I felt the same fear someone might have felt for an addictive drug. If you play Jazz, no one will pay you&#8217;, I thought, &#8217;but if you get hooked on this stuff, no one will even listen to you. Go back to Rock and Roll before it&#8217;s too late.&#8217; Now you guys have created a whole virtual community devoted to my favourite music, with people all over the world playing this music for each other.&#8221; In a few months since its launch, Uhooroo has grown to have close to a thousand musicians from India and the world over.Users include a bansuri player from Lithuania, a sarod player from Slovakia, a chutney musician from the Carribean, a Tamil Christian hip-hop artist from Norway and many others.
