VThe glory of Lord Krishna as envisaged by various composers is the theme chosen by popular vocalist Sikkil Gurucharan for the audio compact disc (Priced at Rs. 199), released under the banner of Amutham Music P Ltd. Gurucharan is blessed with a pleasing voice which has azhutham and finesse. The fast paced sangatis in the songs are clear and do not deviate from the swarasthanas.Papanasam Sivan's Shanmukhapriya song &#8216;Kannanai Pani Maname' serves as the starter and is rendered with a good degree of polish embellished with solfa passages for the pallavi opening. The swaras are sung at 3/4 idam (three aksharas after samam) and culminate in a simple but effective korvai.The frequently heard vivadhi raga kriti of Tyagaraja (&#8216;Ganamurthe') in Ganamurthi is presented without excess ornamentation. One of the master pieces of Muthuswami Dikshitar &#8216;Chetasri Balakrishnam' in Dwijavanti is effectively vocalised and makes for the most engaging composition in this disc.Arresting niravalGurucharan's manodharma gets displayed in his alapana of Saveri which is pregnant with meaningful phrases and not overdone. A good patanthara of Tyagaraja's &#8216;Chalu Chalu' (Misra chapu) from the opera Nowka Charithram follows. The niraval at &#8216;Bhogisayana' is arresting and the kalpanaswaras end with a porutham-oriented korvai. The violinist M.R. Gopinath is rather subdued in his Saveri alapana. His swara replies are to the point. The brief percussive interlude by Tiruvarur Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and T.V. Vasan (ghatam) just passes muster.A song attributed to Oothukadu Venkata Subba Iyer in Husseini &#8216;Aadumvarai' is notable for its lyrical content. Gurucharan continues with the Madurashtakam of Vallabhacharya, which is offered as rendered by M.S. Subbulakshmi in misra Khamaj. An ashtapadi in Kaapi &#8216;Kapimaduripuna' (Jayadeva) is attractive.The tail-enders are &#8216;Aadugiran' (Maand-Sudhananda Bharati), &#8216;Varuvaai Varuvaai' (Savita-Subramanya Bharati) and a thillana of Papanasam Sivan in Behag.The placement of the song in Savita, immediately after the song in Maand, could have been avoided, as the colour of Maand does not get erased while listening to the Savita raga composition. Savita raga sports the scale &#8216;SGMDNS-SNDMGRS' and is a derivative of Sankarabharanam. The fare covered by this disc is varied and good to listen to.
