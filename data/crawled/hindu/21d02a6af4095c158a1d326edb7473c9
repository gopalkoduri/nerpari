VHARISH BAL`Layavadya tharangam,' was a celebration of rhythm. Under the direction of ghatom artiste Thripunithura Radhakrishnan, a 10-member ensemble performed a marvellous musical extravaganza at Kerala Fine Arts Hall in Kochi.When the nada wing of the troupe had Edapally Ajith and Satheesh Varma on the violin and Ajith on the flute, the rest of the group featured talented percussionists on the ganjeera, ghatom, tabla, edakka, chenda and mukharshankh. Radhakrishnan also played the  mridangam.An auspicious piece `mallari,' which is rarely performed these days in music and dance, was a coordinated effort marked with precision and perfection.Scope for improvisationWhile the violinists were given scope for improvisation for the Hamsadhwani piece, `Vathapiganapathim,' thealaapanaswere kept short. Each of the percussionists played the same patterns at the phrase `Veetharaginam vinuthayoginam.'  It was a delight to hear familiar Carnatic phrases reverberate on  the chenda, the tabla and the edakka. In the same vein, `Entharomahanubhavulu' in Sri raga was played at a pace that was in sync with the violin, flute and percussion instruments.Tyagaraja compositions `Seethamma mayamma' in Vasantha and `Niravadhi sukhada' in Ravichandrika, with its dazzlingchittaswaras, enthused the listeners. At certain places, the sound of the flute got submerged owning to the amplified sound of the violins.`Gopalakapahimam' was another number with punch where the quaint mood of the  raga Revagupti shone. This was contrasted with the flamboyant Kathanakuthoohalam in the Patanam Subramanya Iyer composition `Raghuvamsa sudhambudhichandra.'The main piece in Gambheera Natta had a prelude of ragam and a short tanam by Edapally Ajith.String of ragasThe violinists and the flautist presented raga malika swaras in Behag, Ranjani, Kapi and other ragas, at the end of which Edapally Ajith gave an impressive medley of all the ragas at one go, smoothly blending one with the other.The avarthanam, which featured all the percussionists, was more of a rehearsed endeavour; yet one could see variety in the approaches of Dharmatheerthan and Thamarakudi Rajasekharan, who played the tabla and the mukharsankh respectively. At one point, the beats of the instruments were akin to that of a murmur; a wakening tenor from the chenda at the beginning of the cycle resumed the `takadhimi takajhanu' sequence, culminating in a harmonised mukthaippu.Popular numbers like `Alaipayuthe' in Kanada, `Venkatachalanilayam' in Sindhubhairavi and a devotional `Harivarasanam' were played.The popular western note brought the musical collaboration, which was organised by the Kochi-based Dharani, to a grand finale.Bottom Template Starts
