VKochi celebrated &#8216;Tyagaraja Day&#8217; with mellifluous Carnatic vocal concerts. The celebrations kicked off earlier in the day with a Pancharatna keertana led by veteran vocalist Parassala Ponnammal, which was followed by a short vocal concert\u000a by Mathangi Sathyamoorthy.The main concert of the evening was by sisters Ranjani and Gayatri.In this concert, their maiden one  in Kochi,  the sisters displayed their vocal prowess that was  embellished with strict patanthara, rich expression and good manodharma.In &#8216;Eranapai,&#8217; the varnam in Thodi raga, the sisters followed a systematic pattern of gradually unfolding the complexities in the raga with its tricky swaras. The sisters sang &#8216;Swaminatha paripalayashumam&#8217; in Natta raga with brisk swaras. This was followed by  &#8216;Sree Valli Devasenapathe&#8217; in raga Natabhairavi,  a rarely heard composition of Papanasam Sivan.Ranjani excelled in her elaboration of Pantuvarali. One moment she was  concentrating on the lower and middle ranges with gamaka sancharas in a voice that can be described as mildly-husky, and in the next she was  singing  briga phrases in the upper octave. The composition was Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Ninneneranammi nanura&#8217; in Roopaka tala. Although many points in her neraval for &#8216;Vedashasthra purana&#8217; were unpredictable, she was at ease during the rendition.The chemistry between the two sisters was commendable. They  appear to have  weighed the positives  and negatives in each other&#8217;s singing to  complement each other well. While Ranjani dealt with the brigas and lower octaves, Gayatri took over the higher sancharas. There was  synchronisation in their kriti  renditions and even the modulations were  patterned. Delhi Sayiram on the mridangam ably supported the rhythmic patterns.&#8216;Enrikku Sivakripai varumo,&#8217; a plaintive Mukhari song by Neelakanta Sivan, was rendered at a controlled pace. Crackling chittaswaras in &#8216;Vararagalaya&#8217; in Chenju Kamboji  provided ample variety.Gayatri, who has a sharper voice than her sister,  excelled in the Mohanam alaapana. The akarams and the jhanda prayogas enhanced the the elaboration.  Kumaran  complemented her well on the violin and kept his elaboration neat and brief.During the swara singing for the kriti &#8216;Nannupalimpa,&#8217; the vocalists offered some interesting glides in the notes and some rehearsed korvais. The tani between Sayiram and Kottayam Unnikrishnan on the ghatam was mostly  spontaneous and had some  rhythmic patterns to enthuse  the listeners.&#8216;Eppadi padinaro&#8217; in Karnataka Devagandhari had some marvellous modulations that  brought out some truly melodious singing. Swati Tirunal&#8217;s composition &#8216;Sankara Srigiri nadaprabho&#8217; and Namdev&#8217;s Abhang in Marubehag had some magnificent improvisation akin to the taans in Hindustani music.The only aspect that marred a superb concert  was the sisters&#8217; constant demands to turn on and off the main lights, and increase and decrease the speed of the fans.The event was jointly organised by Adi Sankara Educational Institutions, Kalady, and Kerala Fine Arts Society.
