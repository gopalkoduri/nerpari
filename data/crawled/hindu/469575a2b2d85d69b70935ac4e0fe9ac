VAkashvani SangeetT.R.MahalingamCarnatic classical &#8211; Rs. 195T.R. Mahalingam, the flautist nonpareil, was a maverick musician who wrote his own music manual. He pioneered a unique style of cross fingering that produced  divine melody from the  humble bamboo instrument. His blowing was something extraordinary, \u000aand his &#8216;bani&#8217; close to vocal music, quite exceptional.&#8216;Sarasijanabha,&#8217; the khanda jathi ata tala varnam in typical Mali style with alluring Khambodi strains, signals the beginning of the programme that was recorded in 1962 by All India Radio. The reputed accompanists are M.S Gopalakrishnan (violin), C.S. Murugabhoopathy (mridangam) M.N.Kandhaswamy (kanjira) and Alangudi Ramachandran (ghatam).The varnam with its different nadais poses quite a challenge to the accompanists, and being seasoned artistes, they pick up the gauntlet with ease and precision. Kapi, elaborated with emphatic statements and undiluted naadham, is a melodic package, wonderfully refreshing. The maestro&#8217;s description of Kalyani although brief proves that T.R.Mahalingam belongs to a class of his own.The pallavi, set to misra chapu is a manifestation of confidence with laya totally at the master&#8217;s command. The tani avartanam by the veterans is a fine display of excellent rhythmic patterns and high professional quality. The apt expression to use for Mahalingam &#8211; &#8220;What a genius!&#8221;S.P.Bottom Template Starts
