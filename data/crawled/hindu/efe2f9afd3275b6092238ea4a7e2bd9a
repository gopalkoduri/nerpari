VT hiruvidaimarudur Radhakrishnan presented a vocal concert that deviated from the routine. Priya ragas, primarily vivadhi in nature, were chosen as the theme and the rendering of these select songs had a distinct emotive power in them. Koteeswara Iyer's organised numbers form a virtual rubric on the vivadi melas and expectedly three of his songs (Sambho Sadasiva in Yaga Priya, Ghananaya Desika in Rishabha Priya and Arulseyya Vendum in Rasika Priya) figured in this concert.The second of these became the main. Radhakrishnan's voice may not be of the winsome kind, but his approach to raga delineation and its faithful delivery - Rishabha Priya and Nataka Priya (Geetha Vaadhya, Thanjavur Sankara Iyer) - had an erudite approach that dealt with these ragas as they were without encroaching upon their look-alikes.Combining admirably with Thiruvidaimarudur Sankaran (mridangam) Radhakrishnan's swara spells, short and long, had swiftness for its patterns. Sankaran's thani was loaded with power-packed sollus. Two of Dikshitar's compositions, &#8220;Siddhi Vinayakam&#8221; (Shanmukha Priya-Chamaram) and &#8220;Rudrakopa&#8221; (Rudra Priya), M.M. Dhandapani Desikar's evergreen melody Jagajanani (Rathipati Priya) and a Mangalam drawn from the Bhajana Sampradayam (Pasupathi Priya) completed the &#8220;Priya-list&#8221;.Sowmya on the violin accompanied without any sense of hesitancy and her alapana for Natakapriya served to exhibit many positive effects of her musical upbringing. Her swara replies were tailored to be verily close to that of Radhakrishnan's. Her alapana for Rishabha Priya, however, had quite a few phrases that belonged to other ragas. She should lose no time in correcting this tendency. The Priya Bouquet was a Thiruvidaimarudur Vaibhavam concert held recently under auspices of Music Education Trust. The kutcheri was held at &#8220;Sri Parvathy&#8221;, a stately hall of small dimensions. The audio system carried its own glitches. Aren't there options to hold mike-less chamber concerts at such places? Palakkadu Mani Iyer would certainly be pleased, wherever he be.
