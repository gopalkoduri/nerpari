VThe kritis  were rendered with feeling and restraint. Gayatri is bound to go places.  Swaminathan (violin) and Thyagarajan (mridangam) were the accompanists.Gayathri Girish has all the  qualities of an accomplished singer. As a reliable artiste to provide more than one aspect of her musical impulses, her good voice and sahitya gnana help Gayathri Girish in conventional ways of presentation.The Suddhadhanyasi varnam, &#8216;Sree Rajamathangi&#8217; gave her kutcheri a kick start. Her alapana of Hindolam for the composition, &#8216;Maa Ramanan&#8217; captured the real flavour of the raga. However, her raga vinyasam of Kalyani for the kriti, &#8216;Pankajalochana&#8217; and Naattakurinji for RTP, though delineated with faithfulness and confidence,  showed vocal cracks in tarasthayi, giving an impression of intellectual exercise to the rasikas.&#8216;Akilandeswari Duru Suga&#8217; (Karanataka Kapi) was a neat rendition. Her fare included &#8216;Deva Deva&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla), Oothukkadu composition and an ashtapadi in Sivaranjani. Ganesh Prasad&#8217;s violin accompaniment for the raga delineations of Kalyani and Nattakurinji created a reflective mood.Subramaniam (mridangam) and Sundarkumar (kanjira) lent percussive support but their constant giggle  on  stage looked odd.T.M.Krishna&#8217;s scholarly thematic concert  will remain in rasikas&#8217; memory for long.  The supremacy of his bhani was evident from the manner in which he synthesised sampradaya music with classic creativity. The choice of  kritis for treatment spoke of his homework. Compositions revealing the nine kinds of bhakti explicated in the songs of various composers was the variety fare he offered at the kutcheri. &#8216;Ramakathasudha&#8217; in Madhyamavati with swaras set the tone and tenor for the session in a positive way followed by &#8216;Vande Devadeva&#8217; in Begada.The Aahiri alapana showed the lyricism of the raga picturised by him for the song, &#8216;Maayamma.&#8217; In the raga vinyasam of Saranga for the kriti, &#8216;Arunachalanadham,&#8217; Krishna released his musical phrasings with all majesty and splendour in the tara sthayi and every sanchara shone with beauty.His creative instinct was seen in his sketch of the contours of Kedaragowlai raga for the kriti, &#8216;Thulasi Bilva&#8217; and the rendition was emotion-packed. &#8216;Jagadodharana (Kapi), Bharathiar&#8217;s Virutham and &#8216;Intakananandane&#8217; (Bilahari) invited rapt attention of the listeners.Akkarai Subbulakshmi played on the violin in consonance with the artiste&#8217;s conceptualisation of the ragas and swara repartees. Subramaniam (mridangam) and Purushothaman (kanjira) delighted the audience with their laya expertise.Sankari Krishnan&#8217;s thematic recital (of Nayaka) beginning with Mohana Kalyani varnam  in a spirited vein moved on to &#8216;Raghunayaka&#8217; (Bowli) exuding suaveness with interesting variations.Her Shanmukhapriya and Saveri alapanas strode confident paths with sampradaya pidis and the phrasings were handled with confidence. Shankarabharanam elaboration for the main piece in RTP was reflective of her homework. Her choice of songs was rooted in classical vocabulary.Bhaskar painted colourful portraits of Dhanyasi and Saveri. Sivaraman (mridangam) and Gopalakrishnan (kanjira) provided percussive support.Violinists Akkarai Subbulakshmi and Swarnalatha  have developed a style of their own.Their energetic violin duet displayed extraordinary communicative skills in scaling musical heights and plumbing depths of great magnitude. Handling alapanas of Purvikalyani or Bagesri or Keeravani for RTP with apposite expressions to create their imagery was superb. Subbulakshmi&#8217;s vocal rendition of songs in between was full of bhava. Ganapathiraman (mridangam) and Guruprasad (ghatam), inspired by the tempo of the siblings&#8217; play, extended frenetic percussive support.Clarity of diction and impressive vocal range characterised Nithyasree Mahadevan&#8217;s kutcheri. The opening Chalanaattai ata tala varnam standing out for its clarity was followed by &#8216;Orajupu&#8217; (Kannadagowlai), with swaras presented with finesse. A Kalyanavasantham alapana punctuated by an astonishing scope of tensile gamakas in her own inimitable style was her best.The raga vinyasam of Purvikalyani (Gamakakriya) for the kriti, &#8216;Meenakshimemudham&#8217; scored with kalpanaswaras and effective korvai following the niraval.The main item, Saveri, was elaborated with smooth grace for RTP with several prayogas.Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and Karthick (ghatam) proved their intrinsic worth in the percussion wing and their thani was an extension of the spirit and mood of the concert.Embar Kannan&#8217;s facile fingering to produce dulcet notes in alapanas and swara forays won kudos throughout.
