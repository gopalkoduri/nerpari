VIn neighbouring Orissa, Bengal-born Tagore&#8217;s literature and music enjoy great admiration. However, Oriyas had to wait for nearly 70 years to have Rabindra Sangeet in Oriya that was made possible by Cuttack-based eminent English professor A. C. Shukla and his daughter-in-law Trupty Panda, a budding singer. While Shukla has translated the songs, Trupty has rendered her voice to Tagore&#8217;s original compositions.As the world commemorated the death anniversary of India&#8217;s first Nobel Laureate this month, Bhubaneswar-based Bengali cultural organization, Pragati, and the Department of Culture of the Orissa Government came together to stage a special recital of Rabindra Sangeet at Rabindra Mandap in Bhubaneswar.The young singer&#8217;s solo concert commenced with the signature song,Biswaveena, a brilliant composition based on the raga, Shankarabharana, set tojhaap taal. The next five songs were some of the highly popular and immortal monsoon compositions of Tagore, each one based on a rain-related raga. These had been meticulously chosen by the singer keeping the rainy season in mind. Then followed a bouquet of love songs of the master composer.Trupty&#8217;s two-hour recital also included devotional compositions of Tagore. She also presented Brahma Sangeet that had ascended newer heights through the legendary poet-philosopher&#8217;s compositions.She concluded her recital with the immensely popular patriotic song,Jadi Tora Daka Suni, that had inspired many an Indian to join the freedom movement. Two of Trupty&#8217;s albums of Oriya Rabindra Sangeet,Tume Sandhyara MeghamalaandHey Jibananatha, containing collections of 12 love songs and devotional lyrics, respectively, were released on the occasion by Bhubaneswar Music Circle president S. K. Tamotia.
