VSangeetha Sivakumar, who gave a vocal recital in Kochi,  is a student of Charumathi Ramachandran. Her  concentration, discipline and well-prepared format were evident in her concert.Beginning the programme with an Abhogi varnam &#8216;Evvari,&#8217; composed by Pattanam Subrahmania Iyer, she followed it up with Dikshitar&#8217;s  composition  &#8216;Swaminatha&#8217; in Naata,  which was adorned by a graceful phase of swara-singing.The slow tempo in  which the Dikshitar kriti in Kedaram, &#8216;Aanada Natana,&#8217;  was sung showed  how stringently she has been trained by her teachers Vasu  and  Charumathi.Kanada and the subsequent Swati Tirunal piece &#8216;Maamava&#8217;  reflected the  MLV &#8216;bhaani&#8217; in which artistry combines with scholarship,  especially during the rendering of swaras.&#8216;Eti Janmamidi&#8217; in Varali, in which Tyagaraja beseeches the Lord,  and &#8216;Vara-raga-laya&#8217; in Chenchu Kambhoji, in which the saint composer  chides  charlatans who pretend to be learned in music, were sung in a manner that did justice to the lyrics.The pace with which she sang the  Chenchu Kambhoji piece, which had a  delectable sequence of chittaswaram, showed that she could handle  fast flourishes, without impairing the mood and substance of the lyrics.Kambhoji was marvellously  delineated.&#8216;O! Rangasaayi,&#8217; which is believed to have been created by Tyagaraja in his later years, combining diction, doctrine and score,  was rendered evocativley with niravel and swara.V.V.S. Muari, son of V.V. Subrahmaniam, played the violin.  Poonkulam Subrahmaniam who played  the mridangam showed the same vitality that sets apart his guru Mushnam Raja Rao.The concert was organised by Rasikapriya in Kochi.
