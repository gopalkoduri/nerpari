VAsthapadi exponent V. Jayadevan's concert at Thripunithura turned out to be a singular experience for raiskas as the vocalist could easily strike a chord with the audience at Kalikkotta Palace.His innovative attempt to adapt the traditional Ashtapadi programme to the format of a classical Carnatic concert was well accepted. The concert was composed of several Jayadeva kritis. Beginning the recital with a virutham &#8216;Thaamathha manmathha' in Natta, he moved on to the Ashtapadi &#8216;Harirabhi sarathi,' again in Natta.The vocalist chose to begin the next number with a sloka &#8216;Athhaagathaam Maadhava Vrundarena' in Sree raga, followed by the Ashtapadi &#8216;Smarasamarochitha.' Here, Jayadevan changed the raga to Yadukulakamboji at &#8216;Dayithavilochitha.' Likewise, he continued the concert in the same manner with a slokam, &#8216;Athhakaantham Rathisraantham' (Revagupthi) followed by the popular Ashtapadi, &#8216;Kuruyadunandana Chandana Sisira' (Revagupthi) and made it into a ragamalika in ragas Puranira, Malayamarutham and Madhyamavathi.The singer also improvised with a niraval and swaraprastharam at &#8216;Alikulabhanjana Anjanakamrathi' while singing in Revagupthi.Complementing the singerViolinist Nedumangad Sivanandan and flautist Thripunithura Shaji complemented the singer. Each raga was preceded by a short piece on the flute in the same raga, an interesting feature that was welcomed by the audience. This also helped the vocalist in evoking the raga bhava during the aalapana and sloka rendition.Another sloka &#8211; &#8216;Viharathivane Radha' in &#8216;Dhanaasi' raga &#8211; was followed by the Ashtapadi &#8216;Sancharadadharasudha madhuradhwani' in Dhanasi, Mohanam, Arabhi and Surutti, all in Adi tala.Jayadevan also rendered &#8216;Vahatheemalayasameere' in Nathanaamakriya and Behag, set to Roopaka tala. An elaborate aalapana of Sankarabharanam with a slokam &#8216;Athhathaam Gundumasakthaam' was followed by &#8216;Pasyathidisidisi Rahasee Bhavanthi,' an Ashtapadi in Sankarabharanam and Kharaharapriya from &#8216;Thwarithamu'.Jayadevan's niraval and swaraprastharam at Bhavathivilambini Vigalithalajja' in Kharaharapriya were well rendered. It was set to Misra chaapu tala. Finally, Jayadevan did not forget to sing the popular &#8216;Kisalayasayanathale Kurukaamini' in Naathanaamakriya, Chenchurutti, Sahana and Sindhubhairavi. Anand Kumar (mridangam), Krishnadas and Hari (both on the edakka) played well throughout the concert, especially during niraval, swaram and tani.Jayadevan could have given more importance to the sruthi. Prior to the concert, &#8216;Pancharathna Keerthanams' were rendered by eminent musicians to pay homage to Tyagaraja.The concert was conducted by Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha.
