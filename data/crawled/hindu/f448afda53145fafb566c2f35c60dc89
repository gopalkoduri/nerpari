A veena concert by Maya Varma evoked nostalgia of the golden days of the past when music flourished under the patronage of benevolent monarchs.Ahalya Thampurati, a descendent of Kerala Varma Valiyakoyi Thampuran (Kerala Kalidasan) of the Ananthapuram Place, Harippad, was a veteran veena artiste who passed away recently. Her daughter, Maya Varma has imbibed a lot from her mother, her guru, but she has her way of approaching each and every aspect of music.The concert began with the varnam `Sarasijanabha' in Natta ragam (Adi talam). It was treat for the listeners as she simultaneously played in two differentsthayisat certain portions of the raga. She then passed on to `Vallabha Nayakasya' a kriti by Muthuswamy Dishitar in Begada raga, Rupaka tala, with a shortalapanaof thegaraas the prelude. `Kanchadalayathakshi,' a favourite number of veena artistes, was presented neatly and attractively with bright swara passages at `Raja Sasivadane.'
