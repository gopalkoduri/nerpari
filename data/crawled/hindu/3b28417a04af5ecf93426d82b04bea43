VFledgling performer Mahalakshmi who sang at the Bharathiya Vidya Bhavan (Mini Hall) showed that she has a free and naturally high-octave-inclined voice, which she never tried to coax to work modulation wonders. This then was her perceptible advantage. Simhendramadhyamam (&#8216;Asaindhadum Mayil Ondru-Oothukadu') was her main choice which had an alapana and the song itself, packed with words in plenty, perhaps suited her kind of singing. She oriented herself well towards the format of this particular song.Mahalakshmi began with &#8216;Vatapi' (Hamsadhwani) which was quickly followed by &#8216;Sri Nadhadhi Guruguho' another Dikshitar piece in Mayamalavagowla. The alapana here (Mayamalavagowla) and later for Bahudhari (Sadhananda Thandavam-Achutha Dasar) may not have registered well with the seasoned rasika. They seemed less extensive than expected. Her attempts, however, were marked with sincere intentions that merited one's attention.Honing needed&#8216;Shobillu Saptaswara' (Jaganmohini-Tyagaraja) came as a filler prior to the main. Mahalakshmi needs to hone her alapana skills. She should learn to fit certain distinguishing phrases of the ragas at the right points to make the alapanas more credible. It has been stated on several occasions that Kalpita Sangeetham does and has to travel alongside Kalpana Sangeetham. An objective self-assessment will also make her realise that kriti-rendering should be as perfect as it could be and should have as a rule great beginnings and graceful endings.Enthusiasm and youth are on her side and her triumph will depend on how industrious she is and what kind of perspective she gains as she progresses.Shradha, another youngster on the violin exhibited class in the alapanas, especially Simhendramadyamam which was played with amazing clarity. Her style of accompanying gave the listener a sense of satisfaction. Parthasarathy on the mridangam had well-meaning ideas that accommodated the maturity level of the main singer. His fingers seemed to be conscious of the size of the auditorium while playing for the songs and his thani was neatly spaced containing a fine round of sollus that were set evenly and in the right order.(sivakumar2004@gmail.com)
