VWhen a serious and attentive listener of a concert is taken by surprise that the concert is over, it is one sure sign that the artist must have had something to offer that listener, which must have made him savour it.Such was the experience of this writer when he was still in a "Thodi mood", and a tukkada item shook him up after the tani avartanam, as if abruptly.The artist was Arundati Krishnan, a second-year undergraduate student of Science, singing for Hamsadhwani on Friday, February 27, 2009, with Akkarai Swarnalatha and V.S. Raghavan doing the string and percussive credits.One pondered whether it didn&#8217;t make more sense to deliver just five  or six  choice pieces &#8211; as Arundati did - and follow them up with a minor melody or two, in a 90-minute recital than try to pack a large number of compositions.What was even more effective was that the artist, seizing all the minutes between 5.42 and 6.19, brought her recital to a close at the climax, even as the sublime Thodi was still lingering in the mind.Not that pleasant concert formatting was the only virtue in the recital.Arundati is endowed with a natural sweetness of voice, with a commendable octave range, which keeps her (and the listener, too!) comfortable, reaching from the lower madhyama to the higher panchama.Her mature manodharma keeps her anchored at different sthayis, as long as they deserve, without suggestion of a rush, thus giving a wholesome  feeling to an alapana or niraval, evidenced in Thodi (&#8216;Kartikeya Gangeya&#8217;). In the second item, &#8216;Jaya Mahishasuramardini Sritajana Palini,&#8217;  of Muthiah Bhagavathar in Hamsadhwani, Rupakam,  madhyama kalam, the flexibility of her voice was evident.  Particularly in &#8216;Telisi Rama,&#8217; she maintained the nuances in raga lakshana at high speed, without sacrificing  laya.Her  Thodi alapana was  neatly spread out with adequate emphasis at the sthayis (lower &#8216;ma&#8217; to &#8216;pa&#8217;; &#8216;pa&#8217; to higher &#8216;sa&#8217;; &#8216;sa&#8217; to &#8216;pa&#8217;).There was a wholesome sprinkling of rava and vakra sancharas, all of which demonstrated how far she could dig into this raga.Akkarai Swarnalatha  delivered an alapana in her own style, revealing other facets of the raga, which the instrument brings forth.Both the raga and the song of Papanasam Sivan were apt choices for the time of the day.From the start of the song, through the niraval at &#8216;Velmarugumamala,&#8217;  the threesome team put up a dedicated attempt to facilitate the ardent listener&#8217;s picturisation of Karthikeya.The tani avartanam in adi talam that followed  lasted for just an avartanam or two, over a minute, but was adequate to show Raghavan&#8217;s command of not only his instrument but also his musical sensitivity. &#8216;Odi Vaaraayyo, Vaikuntha Pati&#8217; in Mohanakalyani, of Purandaradasa was an  endearing piece, exquisitely rendered.A promising talent, Arundati,  if backed by consistent practice, can command good audience.  One point which needed attention was  stamina.She will profit a good deal if she practises to infuse more power into her delivery, a factor of paramount importance in aural stage presence.
