VDespite the slight discomfort in her throat, Nandita Ravi&#8217;s clarity of diction and uninterrupted flow  with a pliant voice that characterised her vocal recital at the Rajalakshmi Fine Arts struck a deep chord with the listeners. Her aesthetic and charming presentation of the opening varnam, &#8216;Chalamela&#8217; in Durbar gave a nippy start to the rich fare that followed.The following &#8216;Gananatha Namasthe&#8217; in Gowlai dressed with swaras revealed the tenderness of the raga with her vocal malleability. The Devagandhari kriti of Tyagaraja &#8216;Vinaratha Naa Manavi&#8217; was sober.Nandita&#8217;s  virtuosity shone in the delineation of Begada brimming with the raga lakshana and bhava for the kriti &#8216;Anudinamu&#8217; with an exuberant niraval and kalpanaswaras.Her Thodi alapana was well designed with idioms and phrases in the mandarasthayi for the kriti, &#8216;Thanigaivalar.&#8217;  Her Kharaharapriya raga vinyasam was built with both karvais and brighas and impactful phrases in the upper reaches. The niraval at &#8216;Kantiki&#8217; was handled with appropriate phrasings and swaras revealing her exquisite manodharma. Her musical agenda included &#8216;Anandeswara Samrakshithoham&#8217; (Anandabhairavi) and &#8216;Sudhamadhurya&#8217; (Sindhunamakria).Madhav&#8217;s solo versions of Begada, Thodi and Kharaharapriya on the violin had flashes of originality and his replies to the vocalist&#8217;s posers were equally impressive. Kumar&#8217;s (mridangam) embellishment of the kritis with his rhythmic beats heightened the dignity of the recital.
