VMalhar Utsav, a festive celebration of the rains through the seasonal Malhar prakar ragas organised by Gururao Deshpande Sangeet Sabha featured two senior vocalists Neela Bhagwat and Madhav Gudi, exponents of Gwalior and Kirana gharana styles respect\u000aively. Neela commenced her recital with rag gaud malhar, one of the most moving ragas.Technically it is a Heptatonic (sampoorna) raga, which makes use of both shudh and komal nishad notes. Madhyam and shadja are its vadi and samvadi swaras (dominant notes).The exposition of this raga was presented in vilambit tempo of the tal tailwada (a rhythmic cycle of 16 beats) through a khayal bandish &#8220;Kahe Ho Preetam&#8221; followed by a faster-paced composition in drut teen tal &#8220;Jhuki ayi badariya savan ki&#8221;.A tarana in the same raga rendered after the poetic bandish seemed superfluous.The thumri in rag khamaj &#8220;Koyaliya sunave, sakhi mohe biraha satave&#8221; in adha teen tal was suffused with a sense of lyrical abandon.Rajendra Nakod excelled in negotiating the convoluted movements of the rare pashtoo tal in the tappa rendered by Bhagwat.The dadra composition in raga misra piloo, &#8220;Barsan Laagi saavan boondiya&#8221; was marked by brilliant layakari in the laggi section where Ravindra Katoti and Nakod captivated the audience with their spirited performance.Madhav Gudi, the senior most disciple of the legendary vocalist Bhimsen Joshi chose the relatively rare prakar of malhar, nat malhar, an arresting combination of the two ragas, chayanat and miya ki  malhar.Gudi moved the audience with his sublime rendition of this raga in the kirana style through a soothing, meandering alaap.His rich and sonorous delineation of the khayal bandish banara ja exuded the charm and irrestible of appeal of the old world parampara gayaki.Saptak, a well known cultural association for the promotion Hindustani classical music had organised &#8220;Ras Ke Bhare&#8221; , a unique soulful evening of semi-classical music by Neela Bhagwat at the Saptaka Sabhangana.Neela Bhagwat presented a rich fare of bhajans, thumris and tappa. She was accompanied by Katoti on the harmonium. It was a unique concert where Neela also shared her views on the relevance and timeless appeal of thumri music.She emphasised the recuperation of the delicate, dulcet, persuasive rhetoric, kantasammita that was deployed with exemplary finesse in the thumris.Neela illustrated these concepts through several thumris steeped in shringar and romantic melancholy such as &#8220;Sajan tum kahe ko neha lagaye&#8221; in rag tilang, &#8220;Kal Kaha the kanhayi&#8221; in rag kafi and the soulful shivaranjini in quwwali style, &#8220;Sajan bin roye joganiya hai ram&#8221;.Nakod was at his inimitable best in his skilful execution of tala deepchandi , adha teen tal and dadra.
