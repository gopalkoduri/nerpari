VJana Gana ManaTimes Music &amp; Bharat Bala ProductionsCollector&#8217;s Edition - DVD and Audio CD - Rs. 390Audio CD alone &#8211; Rs. 199)How many different ways there are of rendering the national anthem! Purists might frown on artistes taking liberties with the &#8216;authorised version&#8217; of Jana Gana Mana as we know it. But the timeless composition by Rabindranath Tagore has in\u000aspired India&#8217;s leading vocal and instrumental talents to put their own unique stamp and style on the lyrics &#8212; and while remaining faithful to the music, still adding a bit of something new.Bharat Bala had the happy thought of bringing some India&#8217;s musical maestros together to create a unique experience &#8212; visual as well as aural &#8212; and together with his collaborator, Kanika Myer, he has helped put together this unusual Independence Day &#8216;gift&#8217; &#8212; a DVD/CD combo which features over 30 different renderings of the national anthem by artistes as diverse as Hariprasad Chaurasia and Bhimsen Joshi; Lata and Usha Mangeshkar; D.K. Pattammal and Kavitha Krishnamurthy; S.P. Balasubramaniam and Balamuralikrishna; Jasraj and Amjad Ali Khan.... A.R. Rahman helped produce the total product.The collective vocal and video version has been around for some time; the album is the first opportunity for each artiste to render a solo vocal or instrumental version of Jana Gana Mana.There is also a priceless track of Tagore voicing his own lyrics.The DVD version includes an interesting extra &#8212; a brief documentary of how the video was shot in hostile environments like Ladakh &#8212; complete with a 30-member orchestra.It has light-hearted off takes that show the human and fallible side of some of India&#8217;s greatest musical talents.Altogether,  a worthy compilation that will make a handy and timely present to those you want to greet on Independence Day.ANAND PARTHASARATHY
