VPalai Ramachandran, a noted disciple of Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, presented a concert for Fifty-Fifty Club. The list of songs included "Enduku Nirdaya" (Harikambhoji), "Birana Brova Ide" (Tisra Nadai Kalyani), "Harihara Puthram" (Vasanta), "Ksheenamai" (Mukhari) and "Sri Krishnam Bhaja Manasa" (Todi). Nothing more is needed to focus the strong foundations of his learning years. So too the vigour and vitality of the general tenor of the recital.Though occasionally lacking in clarity, the swaraprastharas were power-packed, the objective being to project his fidelity to the Semmangudi techniques.The impressiveness of the raga alapanas of Kalyani, Mukhari and Todi was to inlay the sancharas with frenetic fast-track options. Ramachandran presented this aspect of alapana technique as mainly tempo-driven. While his pursuit of this method was commendable, music also speaks of another important feature, namelyvisranti.Impeccable patantharaWhat was distinct in Ramachandran's performance was the way he has imbibed the Semmangudi tradition. The patanthara of songs was impeccable which contributed much to the liveliness of the concert. But all the same, a sense of balance between the durita, madhyamakala and vilambakala is called for in his expository technique, not exclusively swiftness.The violin support by V.V. Ravi provided to some extent a tempered measure of sancharas in his solo versions of Kalyani and Todi in particular. He cast aside the temptations of speed in the raga development. It was the mridangist Kumaranalloor Rajamani who at intervals banged the instrument to add pep to the vocalist's inclinations.SVKBottom Template Starts
