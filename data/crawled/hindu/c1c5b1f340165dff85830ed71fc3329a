VAkshay Padmanabhan presented a vocal concert recently at Karpagam Gardens Vinayagar temple, Adyar, under the auspices of Sri Sadguru Sangeetha Samajam, as part of Purasawalkam&#8217;s monthly Panchami concert dedicated to Saint Tyagaraja.A bright &#8216;Shobhillu Saptaswara&#8217; (Jaganmohini-Rupakam) set the tone for the evening. Was it necessary to pack it with a heavy dosage of swaras, is a question which young Akshay has to ponder about.An in depth study of the saint&#8217;s kritis will give any performer the space to explore ragas confidently, for they are brimming with the raga saramsam.The brief alapana of Arabhi was anaemic, the saving grace being the kriti &#8216;Naa Moralanu&#8217; (Adi).Gifted with a supple voice, Akshay&#8217;s forays in the vivadhi raga Naganandini was an excellent essay. Mixing his alapana with long karvais and brigas, he made it attractive. Karaikal Venkatasubramaniam&#8217;s violin reply was a passionate one.&#8216;Saththalayni&#8217; (Adi) was rendered with aplomb and thankfully did not have any kalpanaswaras. The Mukhari alapana that preceded &#8216;Muripemu&#8217; (Adi) was a sincere attempt. The matured neraval for the charanam &#8216;Eedulayni Malayamaruthamu&#8217; brought out the devotional fervour of the lines.Akshay&#8217;s imagination was in full flow in the alapana of Nalinakanthi (&#8216;Manavyalakim&#8217;, Adi)) and matching him phrase to phrase was Karaikal.Palayamkottai Guru Raghavendra (mridangam) embellished the kriti with his fast paced tekkas and imaginative arudhis.Akshay&#8217;s creative abilities and open throated singing helped him delve deep into Kalyani. The inevitable neraval in &#8216;Sita Gowri Vagishwariyanu&#8217;, the anupallavi of &#8216;Ethavunara&#8217; (Adi) was well executed.Venkatasubramaniam proved a perfect foil to Akshay. Guru Ragavendran&#8217;s playing was a clever mixture of both heavy and deft touches. His unobtrusive rhythmic interpretations of the kritis were truly professional. Akshay should note to keep his eyes wide open while singing and with sustained effort, he is bound to go places.
