VAs part of the third national conference on Environmental Science and Technology for three days last week under the aegis of Government College for Women at Srikakulam, music lovers were treated to a flute recital. N.N. Hemanand Narayan of Tirupathi performed at the concert.Getting off to a tunefully evocative start withMamavasadajanani(Kannada), he delightfully rendered alaapana ofBahudharifor Brovabharama in tune with the emotions embedded in it with soulful involvement and concluded with conformable swarakalpana.Similarly, he next renderedNinnuvina Marigaladaof Syamasastry (Reethigoula) in which the expression of Manodharma by way of aalapana and swaram were fluent and occassionally even eruditely despite the vakra attribute of the raga. Then, after renderingEnthamuddo(Bindumalini), he endearingly came out with an expansive expatiation ofVasudevayani(Kalyani) and concluded his concert withPalukebangarumayanaof Ramadas (Anandabhairavi).M.P. Ramesh of TTD Annamacharya Project on mridangam and Alugolu Satyanarayana of TTD Music College who rendered excellent support on mridangam and ghatam also rendered scintillating thani afterVasudevayani. Former staffer of AIR, Tiruvallur V. Parthasaradhi rendered invigorating support on violin and contributed grandeur in his turns.
