VAjugalbandi concert by Dr. Suma Sudhindra (Carnatic veena) and Pravin Godkhindi (Hindustani flute), accompanied by Anoor Ananthakrishna Sharma (mridanga), S.N.Narayana Murthy (ghata), and Kiran Godkhindi (tabla), was organised recently by the Sri Krishna Kalakshetra, Sri Radhakrishna Mandir, ISKCON, Bangalore.The main focus of the hour long performance was on a raga tana pallavi in Kalyani raga, corresponding to Yaman in the Hindustani idiom. The alapana began on a tranquil note, unfolding the beauty of the scale in a meticulously structured exposition that bore testimony to technical virtuosity and aesthetic sensibility, and highlighted similarities as well as subtle differences between the two styles. While the veena revealed luminous facets of the raga imbued with gentle gamakas, the flute unveiled the compelling appeal of the plain gandhara, madhyama and nishada. The expansion around the madhya sthayi nishada and the tara shadja, and the subsequent fast passages by both artistes were particularly attractive.The tana, initiated on the veena with a profusion of dexterous patterns, elicited appropriate and expressive responses from the flute, leading to a rhythmically vibrant pallavi set to adi tala. The kalpana swaras appended to it were notable for easy fluidity and laya expertise, accentuated by exuberant and expert percussion that alternated between the mridanga, ghata and tabla, and an occasional confluence of the three marked by perfect synchronisation and understanding. The swaras concluded with a stint at the tara sthayi shadja and a final rhythmic sequence, followed by a tani avarthana.The performance ended with &#8220;Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma&#8221; in Madhyamavathi.***Nadasurabhi Cultural Association hosted a concert of special compositions of Dikshithar by senior vocalist Suguna Purushothaman, accompanied by Charulatha Ramanujan (violin), Anoor Ananthakrishna Sharma (mridanga) and Vyasa Vittala (khanjira).&#8220;Sri Mahaganapathiravathumam&#8221; in Goula raga and misra chapu thala, suffixed with a few kalpana swaras, was followed by the rarely heard &#8220;Akhilandeshwaryai Namasthe&#8221; in Arabhi. A brief alapana of Khamach preceded &#8220;Sri Swaminathaya Namasthe&#8221; in khanda chapu thala, also adorned with some kalpana swaras. A mellow alapana of Hindolam, reflecting the evocative use of the nishada and the soft swaying sancharas of the ensuing &#8220;Neerajakshi Kamakshi&#8221; in rupaka thala, culminated in a few kalpana swaras appended to the charanam line beginning &#8220;Gauri&#8221;.The scale of Shuddha Mukhari, a derivative of Kanakangi, was demonstrated as prelude to the composition &#8220;Muraharena Mukundena&#8221; in rupaka tala.The master composer's penchant for variety in tala was exemplified in the Manoranjani krithi &#8220;Balambike&#8221;, set to matya tala. The main raga of the evening, Mukhari, was elaborated in some detail, and the majesty of the krithi &#8220;Pahimam Ratnachalanayaka&#8221; in adi tala was enhanced by a sedate tempo, and by the kalpana swaras and the tani avarthana that followed.Video displays of the salient aspects of the ragas, the texts and their esoteric import, and the deities extolled in the compositions, served to enumerate some of their complex musical and spiritual components. Though the lead artiste was hampered by a sore throat, the presentation, ably supported vocally by Koushik, and augmented by exemplary instrumental accompaniment, was erudite and informative.
