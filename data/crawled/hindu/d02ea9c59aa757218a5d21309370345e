VG. SWAMINATHANIf veena itself is a special and divine instrument, Jayanthi Kumaresh&#8217;s expertise and experience in playing it,  make it more so  because of her emphasis on the clarity of the sahitya which brings  out the melody aspect of classical music.The Nadopasana Trust recital of Jayanthi at the Dakshinamurthy Auditorium carried another speciality as she  was accompanied by veteran percussionist Vellore Ramabhadran. The experienced percussionist created rhythmic patterns and more important, his thani avartanam with B.S.Purushotham on the kanjira was remarkably enticing, full of silken strokes for which the maestro is so well-known.Jayanthi&#8217;s brand of music with the accent on &#8216;gamakam&#8217; came to the fore in all her raga delineations, kriti renditions and swaraprastharas. The second item in Abhogi &#8216;Manasu Nilba&#8217; of Tyagarja was played in an immensely pleasing tenor with the words  leaping out of the veena expressively.Similar was the experience with the Vachaspathi kriti &#8216;Parathpara&#8217; by Sivan. The alapana  was studded with the finer nuances of the raga. A quick paced &#8216;Vara Narada&#8217; in Vijayashri and &#8216;Ide Bhagyamu&#8217; in Kannada were fillers in between.Was it experimental or a form of novelty, one could not exactly figure out, when Jayanthi made a prelude to the weighty and main Sankarabharanam alapana and tanam with a sober Vagulaparanam and sprightly Amritavarshini.In fact, these embellishments, though independently  appealing, did not  blend with Sankarabharanam.   The compensation came with the poignant composition &#8216;Ethuda Nilachithe&#8217; of Tyagaraja that went on a swift mode.Intricate matrices of  kalpanaswara  full of gamakam were affixed to the charanam line. The concluding part carried one of MLV&#8217;s favourites, &#8216;Baro Krishanyya&#8217; in ragamalika in all its magic.Bottom Template Starts
