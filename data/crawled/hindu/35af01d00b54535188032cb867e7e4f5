Master K.Satyanarayanan, a disciple of his mother Lalita, Mandolin Srinivas and A.Kanyakumari, he handled the keyboard thought to be alien to traditional carnatic classical music, with amazing prowess and thrilled the audience. The programme, which took place at Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram under the agis of Sri Sadguru Sangeeta Sabha of Vijayawada, was a rare treat to therasikasof the city. The wonder kid, Satyanarayanan has already recorded dozens of cassettes and CDs and has given concerts in a number of foreign countries.In his very first visit to Vijayawada, Satyanarayanan won over the hearts of the music lovers. He left  the audience in raptures right from the start and maintained the tempo  till the end with support from violinist B.V.Durga Bhavani and mridangist K.Sai Giridhar. The concert took off well withViriboni ata tala varnamin Bhairavi. Satyanarayan amply showed his laya command in playing the tough varnam in chaturasram, trisram and chaturasra paikalam (three tempos) with perfection. Next he playedVatapiin Hamsadhvani with brief ragam, niraval and kalpana swaras.Sitamma Mayammain Vasanta was followedArabhi Pancha ratna keertana-Sadhinchene.There was brief but superb alapana of Jaganmohini preceding the keertanaSobhillu Saptaswara.Ksheera Sagara Sayanawas another attractive item.
