VA graceful portrait of Anandabhairavi was accentuated by leisurely glides and defining pidis followed by Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Maanasa Guruguha Roopam Bhajare&#8217; articulated with due respect for sahitya bhava. A brisk &#8216;Vinaradana&#8217; (Devagandhari, Tyagaraja) preceded the main piece, a ragam-tanam-pallavi in Thodi. The alapana was constructed with care and guided by a sense of clear direction.  The tanam was a tad sketchy.The pallavi &#8216;Meenalochani&#8217;  was smooth sailing. S. Karthick (violin) presented a neat sketch of Anandhabhairavi and a catchy version of Kapi during the ragamalika. Kumbakonam Swaminathan (mridangam) provided unobtrusive percussive support.
