VThe Ambalam Centre for Performing Arts conducted a two-day festival of music and dance titled &#8216;Parampara' at the Chettinad Vidyashram auditorium. On the second day, T.V. Ramprasadh presented a vocal concert accompanied by T.K. Ramanujacharyalu on the violin, Srimushnam Raja Rao on the mridangam and E.M. Subramaniam on the ghatam.Ramprasadh's strong yet supple voice is an asset and his ingenuity is his strength; but one wonders why he tries to overload his presentation with all kinds of embellishments making his music complex rather than inspiring.Nevertheless, Ramprasadh's Bhairavi was the highpoint of his 90-minute concert. The raga exposition carried long kaarvais, abundance of akaras and pregnant pauses. The end product was a perfect manifestation of the vocalist's musical conception. Ramprasadh chose Arunachala Kavi's famous &#8216;Yaro Ivar Yaro' in a leisurely pace quite oblivious of the time factor. So his rendition was slow with a luxurious niraval on &#8216;Chandrabimba Mukha' and a colourful swara suite.There were just two other numbers in the concert -- the starting &#8216;Rakshamam Charanagatham' in Gambhira Nattai by Meenkshisutha and a Poorvikalyani raga essay and Neelakanta Sivan's &#8216;Ananda Nadamaduvar.' Both had fairly lengthy swara segments.Need for precisionTime management is as important as the content and this scribe once again stresses this aspect (perhaps much to the chagrin of those who support the extraordinary freedom of expression of the artists); it makes sense to present a precise and perfectly planned concert than getting carried away and closing the recital in a hurry. Ramanujacharyalu is a commendable and competent violinist and his raga treatises and swara suites were in accordance with the vocalist's demands. With a veteran like Srimushnam Raja Rao on the mridangam in the company of E.M. Subramaniam on the ghatam, Ramprasadh enjoyed the best rhythmic support. The thani showcased varying patterns.
