VJ.B. Keerthana from Chennai, hailed as a highly virtuosic vocalist in the making, rendered a recital last Friday at Kalabharathi, Vishakapatnam. The 20-year-old vocalist was accompanied by Manda Ravali, younger in age than Keerthana, on violin and M. Yedukondalu on mridangam like virtuosic votaries with professional finesse.A disciple of S. Sundar for more than a decade, Keerthana is a recipient of CCRT scholarship, has won many awards including that of Music Academy and Indian Fine Arts Society in her teens. She has also rendered full fledged recitals for noted sabhas all over the South. At Kalabharathi, she got specially attracted for effusively exultant coverage of well over two and half octaves with sharp sensitivity, but not without the stamp of youthful exuberance.Starting with Aditala varnam in Behag in the slow and fast tempos, she rendered Saraswathi in Saraswathi in Roopakatalam, elaboration of Bhajanaseya (Dharmavathi), similarly Yentanuchu (Yadukula Kambhoji), Samajavaragamana (Hindolam), little more expansively Durusuga (Saveri), a composition in Tilang, and eruditely set ragam, thanam and pallavi in bhairavi in Misrachapu.Ravali stabilising the stable equilibrium on violin in particular in her chances and similarly Yedukondalu on mridangam and executing subtle thani serenely contributed splendour.Keerthana succeeded in successfully infusing aesthetic fervour almost for the first time in the recital, and the rendering of a Surdas Bhajan followed by Muddugare Yasoda marked a splendid conclusion.
