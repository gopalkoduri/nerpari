VBhajan SangrahSikkil C. GurucharanGiri trading Agency P ltdMRP Rs. 99Bhajans and abhangs  have over the years got integrated into the  repertoire of Carnatic musicians, especially vocalists.Some of them make it a point to include at least one bahjan or abhang in their concert.Sikkil Gurucharan  has recorded nine bhajans for Giri Trading Agency. The composers  are Tulsidas, Surdas and Meera. Gurucharan&#8217;s sruti aligned voice and good diction contribute to the listening pleasure.The first bhajan in this disc is a creation of Tulsidas in Khamas (&#8216;Bhajamana&#8217;) followed by  Behag  (&#8216;Neinanume&#8217;).A couple of Surdas&#8217;s compositions in Bhagesri (&#8216;Nisadhinu&#8217;) and Sindubhairavi (&#8216;Suneri Maine&#8217;)  sung with  the accent on the lyrics are enjoyable. Gurucharan sticks to the versions of M.S. Subbulakshmi in his vocalisation of a couple of Meera bhajans like &#8216;Mein Hari&#8217; (Yaman) and &#8216;Hari Tum Haro&#8217; (Darbari Kanada). This is bound to  find favour with the diehard fans of M.S.The other bhajans which feature in this compact disc are &#8216;Hari Main Tho&#8217; (Desh-Meera), &#8216;Morey Anganame&#8217; (Jenjhutti-Meera) and &#8216;Maiyya Mori&#8217; (Bhimplas-Surdas).The orchestration is fairly good except that the musical interludes on the harmonium are too loud and amateurish and do not merge with the sensitive singing of Gurucharan.
