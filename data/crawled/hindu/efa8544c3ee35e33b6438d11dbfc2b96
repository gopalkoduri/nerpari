VR.Vedavalli is a connoisseur&#8217;s delight. Well, she may be a fastidious musician who would never budge a millimetre from her stand of classicism but at the same time she also knows how to please the audience with her soft but solid musical prowess sans extravagant expressions.In her concert to mark the birth centenary celebrations of violin maestro R.K.Venkatarama Shastry at the Raga Sudha Hall, Vedavalli once again reiterated, to the new generation of singers, that one need not necessarily deploy flamboyant arsenals to attract the listener.Vedavalli&#8217;s musical charm stems from her strong knowledge base reinforced with several decades of experience.The choicest prayogas of a raga, the inflections loaded with subtlety, the soft but tight grip on the raga bhava, the intense sahitya presentation contribute to a very finely etched final presentation.The brief essay of Yadukulakhambodi with &#8216;Ninnu Sevinchina&#8217; adorned with its enticing chittaswara-sahitya suite and the detailed Bhairavi with &#8216;Tanayuni Brova&#8217; and the niraval swaras at &#8216;Vatsamu Venda Denuvu Chanuno&#8217; were melded with raga and bhava. Vedavalli captures the most vital and weighty  phrases in raga expressions and niraval.Each syllable of the kalpanaswaras is aesthetically encapsulated in the raga&#8217;s beauty.The way the veteran builds her phrases in raga alapana and kalpanaswaras were just pedagogy to the younger generation.Withering of the power of voice with age may show signs of strains in touching the upper notes but not in the middle and lower octaves.Vedavalli could comfortably reign supreme in these areas and extract the essence of the raga and shares the anubhava with the listener.&#8216;Bantu Reeti&#8217; in Hamsanadam, &#8216;Undethi Ramudu&#8217; in Harikhambodi, &#8216;Brova Samayamide&#8217; in Gowrimanohari were included in the right juncture and tempo with kalpanaswaras.The concluding session provided a colourful viruttam seamlessly bonding a meaty Saveri, moving Sahana, tender Chenchuruti, soporific Neelambari, vibrant Sindhubhairavi and resonant Surutti followed by &#8216;Kelano Hari&#8217; by Purandaradasa. The lustrous Vasantha Tillana came as a fitting finale. Vedavalli had the vocal support of her disciples Sumithra and Sumathy Krishnan.Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi on the violin reflected the classic nuances of the vocalist in the same format at the same time demonstrating her own ingenuity.Vellore Ramabhadran is a percussionist who creates rhythm with soft beats of well defined patterns. No wonder his percussion support suited Vedavalli&#8217;s definitive singing.
