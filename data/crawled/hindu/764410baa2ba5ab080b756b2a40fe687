VIt was an aural treat for  music buffs of Palakkad as up-and-coming artiste E.M. Sandeep captured their hearts with the rendering of popular as well as rare ragas and kritis of various composers.  However, preference was given to the compositions by Swati Tirunal.Palakkad A. Ganesan&#8217;s musical prowess was evident as he accompanied the vocalist on the mridangam. Kodunthirappaly Subbaraman on the violin provided able support throughout the concert.Sandeep opened the concert with the Adi tala varnam in   Sahana &#8216;Karunimpa,&#8217; composed by Thiruvottiyoor Thyagayya, by repeating the poorvanga and charanam and charanaswaras in second speed. A Vighneswara sthuthi &#8216;Gam Ganapathe&#8217; in Hamsadhwani, set to Adi tala (thisra gathi), composed by Harikesanalloor Muthayya Bhagavathar, was adorned with impressive manodharmaswara in two speeds.&#8216;Karunakara Madhava mamava bhasura,&#8217; a Swati Tirunal kriti in Begada, set to Roopaka tala, sung in medium tempo, was followed by a mellifluous ragalapana of Reethigowla. The famous &#8216;Jananee ninuvina,&#8217;  set to Misrachappu, sung in a slow pace, showcased the grandeur of the composition. A scintillating swaraprasthara ensued.&#8216;Ba gayanayya&#8217; of Tyagaraja in Chandrajyothi, set to Adi tala, paved the way to a ragalapana of Arabhi and a rare composition of Swati Tirunal, &#8216;Vande Maheswram, Indukaladharam,&#8217; a hymn to the deity of Sucheendram,  set to Misrachappu tala. Next came a Dikshitar kriti in Kokilapriya, &#8216;Kodandha ramam anisam bhajami,&#8217; set to Adi tala, and a fast number &#8216;Nathajana palini Nalinakanthi&#8217; in  Nalinakanthi. Its raga signature was in the pallavi itself.The main item of the concert was a comprehensive elaboration of  Thodi.  &#8216;Devadeva mam palaya,&#8217; another rare composition of Swati Tirunal, set to Misrachappu tala, had delectable niraval and brilliant swarakalpana at  &#8216;Naradadi muni&#8230;.&#8217; It was well received by the audience. Subbaraman followed the rendition of Reethigowla, Arabhi and Thodi with dexterity and utmost raga bhava.The thaniavarthanam had a pleasing laya. The vocalist took up &#8216;Brahma mokade&#8217; of Annamacharya in Bowli towards the latter part of the concert. The ragamalika slokam &#8216;Vandematharam Ambika Bhagavathim&#8230;,&#8217; began with Anadabhairavi and moved on to Kalyani at the lyrical sequence &#8216;Kalyani&#8230;.&#8217; It then moved on to Ranjani at &#8216;Ranjani&#8230;&#8217; and passed on to Neelambari, followed by the padam &#8216;Kanthanodu chennu melle&#8217; of Swati Tirunal. &#8216;Matha Marakathasyama&#8217; from Adi Sankara&#8217;s Syamaladandhakam  and &#8216;Bhagyada Laksmi baramma&#8217; of Purandaradasa in Madhyamavathi concluded the concert.
