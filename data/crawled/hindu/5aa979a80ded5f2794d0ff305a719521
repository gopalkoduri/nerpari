VWhen Zakir Hussain plays with those magic fingers, the tabla turns from a mere percussive instrument into a melodic instrument. With Dishad Khan on the sarangi regulating the tempo, &#8216;An Evening With Zakir Hussain,&#8217; organised by Dharani Society at Gokulam Park Convention Centre, Kochi, was one to remember.Right from the moment he imparted a light touch on the &#8216;baaya&#8217; or the left tabla, Zakir wove a tapestry of beats, in rhythm and movement.Though there was the promising Dilshad Khan&#8217;s sarangi, it was certainly a Zakir solo. There was the mix of the purist and the classical with the familiar and the appealing. Getting the pulse of the audience in a jiffy, Zakir spiced up his playing with glamour and gimmicks, rather than restricting it to purely classical.Eloquent and humourous, Zakir enlivened every phase of the concert with explanations and interpretations. Even while talking Zakir&#8217;s left hand kept the beat, meticulously. The raag they chose was Behag. The mood it created was a blend of romance and pathos. And when Dishad explored the shades of the raag on the sarangi, which in itself has this haunting, desolate feel, the mood was perfect.Peshkar, the traditional flag-off point for a tabla solo, is basically an introduction. This is a sort of invocation, as Zakir said, &#8216;a prayer to Goddess Saraswati, the gurus, and the masters.&#8217; This part of the solo is similar to the &#8216;alaap&#8217; or development of a raga. Beginning in a slow tempo, Zakir gradually expanded and unfolded an amazing range of sounds and rhythms. All the while the sarangi kept company, playing on the repeated melody phrase.In the second phase of the concert, Zakir went into a mesmerising elaboration. This phase, the traditional Kayadas, is where the tablist reveals his finger techniques, speed, clarity and tonal quality. There was power when Zakir&#8217;s magic fingers wove patterns on his tabla.Like any musician, the tabla player builds up a repertoire through experience and from material handed down from father to son, from guru to shishya. These pre-composed compositions evolve with the tabla player. In the third movement of the concert Zakir demonstrated some of these compositions, interpreting them in his inimitable style.For each of them Zakir had a tale, which made understanding the rhythm compositions easy. There was the Hiran Paran which described the rhythmic movement of the deer, Topa Paran, the sounds of the cannon, the dhamaru of Lord Shiva during the thandav blending with the mridangam of Lord Ganesha and the sound of the conch and many more. This was a real recreation of a whole generation of rhythm handed down to Zakir.There was, it seemed, no defining line between this and the final phase. Zakir who held the audience spellbound by his virtuosity also delighted them with some interesting interpretations for each composition. Instead of saying that he was moving into the final phase, Rela, he talked about a king and how they stood in awe of the train (rail), listening to its sound. The word &#8216;rela&#8217; is said to have been derived from &#8216;railgadi&#8217; or train.Rela involves repetitions of fast syllables. It means, as Zakir said in the course of the concert, a sudden onrush, like &#8216;paani ka rela.&#8217; The feature of this phase was speed.  His fingers moved at lightning speed, his right hand often hitting the edge of the tabla with sharp strikes, each beat resoundingly clear, leading to an abrupt climax.And whatever he played, the beats that he created, Zakir never deviated from the teen taal that he had fixed for the concert. Simply magical!
