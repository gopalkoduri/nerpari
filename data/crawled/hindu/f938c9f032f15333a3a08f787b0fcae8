VTimes MusicCD Rs 295Cassette Rs 65The mellifluous violin of L. Subramaniam anchors this musical tribute to India&#8217;s cultural diversity on the occasion of Independence Day.The first of five tracks is a rather free wheeling variation of &#8216;Vishnava Janato&#8217; bringing together the voices of Pandit Jasraj, Kavita Krishnamurti, Remo Fernandes, Pankaj Udhas and others, which might not appeal to the older generation  who relish the bhajan rendered in traditional style.&#8216;Rhythm Symphony&#8217; features mridangam, ghatam, kanjira, tabla, conch, chendai and a variety of other Indian percussion instruments, skilfully morphing nine ragas. Subramaniam then does it all by himself, with a violin solo in nine ragas.&#8216;Visions of India&#8217; achieves a similar melding vocally, showcasing a number of singing styles from Carnatic classical ( Balamuralikrishna) to Marathi Abhang (Suresh Wadkar) to Bollywood (Kavita Krishnamurti) to Bengali Baul (Purno Das and Dibyendu Das).The album is rounded off (after a reprise of the opener) with a rousing &#8216;Youth Anthem&#8217; composed by  Subramaniam for the 2008 National Youth Games, with Hindi lyrics by Sameer.A nice musical keep sake for the 61st anniversary of our Independence.
