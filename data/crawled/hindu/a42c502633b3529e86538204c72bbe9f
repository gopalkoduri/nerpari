VG.S. PAULEver since the emergence of Sangeetha Sabhas during the beginning of the last century, `musician-brothers' have been a phenomenon in concert music.Kerala had the inimitable Alathur Brothers to its credit. Now the Thrissur Brothers Srikrishna Mohan and Ramkumar Mohan, Chennai-based chartered accountants in their twenties, sons of  mridangam maestro Thrissur R. Mohan, are all set to emulate the Alathur Brothers. The Thrissur Brothers enthralled music fans in Thrissur with their performance.Encores galoreOwing to their clear diction and aesthetic modulations, the highlight of the  two-and-a-half hour concert, the audience paid their compliments to the duo by requesting encores. The selection of  compositions was impressive too.The opening number `Chalamela' a famous Adi tala varnam in Nattakurinji, served to build a rapport with the audience.The strict disciplining they had undergone under the late Neyyattinkara Mohanachandran in the Nadalayapravah School of Music, Thrissur, was evident.`Siddhivinayakam,' a Dikshitar composition set to Rupaka tala, was noteworthy for theswarasrendered.After the Hindolam number, `Chandrasekhara' in khanda chappu, they broke into a Tyagaraja composition in the not-so-familiar raga Malawi, `Nenarunchinaanu anitiki' in Adi. The duo exhibited maturity in rendering theswarasin fast tempo, which the composition demanded.The purity of sruti and the keen sense of tala were remarkable. Moreover, the composition marked a change from the previous ones in relatively slow tempos.A similar change was again effected after the Dikshitar composition in Mohanam and misra chappu, `Narasimha agascha parabrahma' and the ever-fresh Dwijavanti number of Dikshitar, `Akhilanteswari' in Adi.`Rama nee samana' received an eloquent portrayal. Perhaps, what endeared this number most to the audience was the effortless detour the brothers took to Valachi, Revathy and Kapi. Theavartanamby  Thrissur R. Mohan (mridangam), Trikkakkara Y.N. Santharam (ganjira), Udupi Sreedhar (fhatam) and Neyyattinkara Krishnan (mukharsing) contributed  in making the concert a memorable one. M. Ratheesh, on the violin, provided excellent support.Bottom Template Starts
