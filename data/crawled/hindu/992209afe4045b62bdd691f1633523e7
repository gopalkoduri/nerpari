VNarayanadas was a versatile genius with a mastery over several Indian and foreign languages . Narayana Das used the prefix &#8216;Ajjada&#8217; to his surname, which was his birthplace. He combined &#8216;Adhyatmikata and Samajikata&#8217;(spiritual and social aspects) in his rendition. He was equally good in writing in &#8216;accha Telugu&#8217; (Telugu sans any influence of Sanskrit). Vocalists Indira Kameswara Rao and Duddu Radhika rendered a few Dasu compositions, that proved as effective and rich in content.Kanikaramunain &#8216;Hamsadhwani&#8217; in praise of Vinayaka, opened the concert.Maanasama Neevu Maruvakavein &#8216;Suddhasaveri&#8217; from Adibhatla&#8217;s harikatha &#8216;Janaki Sapatham&#8217;, was rich in poetic content. Shanmukha Sarma was giving out the salient features in poetic expression of Dasu in the kriti part, which was quite informative.Neepadambu daakinantain &#8216;Kedara Gowla&#8217;, depicted a sequence from &#8216;Sita Kalyanam&#8217;, describing Ahalya&#8217;s &#8216;shaapa vimochanam&#8217; scene, written in verse form.Kannavarenta dhanyulowas a literary treat, that described the charm of Lord Rama.  The vocalist duo, supported by their young disciples K.Akhila and U. Hiranmayi, rendered some more compositions from Adibhatla&#8217;s famous works &#8216;Rukmini Kalyanam&#8217;, &#8217;Srirama Paduka Pattabhishekamu&#8217; and &#8216;Hanumat Sandesam&#8217; . O. Rajasekhar was on violin and G. Ramachander on mridangam. It would have been better to if a single vocalist was made to sing these unfamiliar kritis so as to retain the lyrical sweetness with clarity, rather than a group rendition.
