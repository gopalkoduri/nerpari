VHAREESH BALMaharajapuram Srinivasan's vocal timbre, form and persona bear a striking resemblance to his father, the legendary Maharajapuram Santhanam. And he lives up to this great tradition.  His concert, organised by Kerala Fine Arts Society, saw him rendering the choicest kritis popularised by his father.A varnam in Charukesi set the right mood for the concert.Swarasfor `Abheeshta varada Sree Mahaganapathe' were sung with great panache to provide verve and excitement. A racy Pantuvarali exposition enchanted the audience.Impressive rendition`Ramuni Marakave' inmadhyamakalawas vocally supported by Maharajapuram Ganesh Vishwanath. Although Ganesh slipped to different octaves other than the ones sung by the main vocalist,  he proved his mettle in the elucidation of the main raga, Kalyani.`Abhayavarade sharade' in Mishra chappu was a delightful change from the oft-sung Hindolam kritis. The goddess Rajeswari who slays asuras like Chanda and Munda is hailed in the beautiful kriti in Janaranjani `Pahimam Sree Rajarajeswari.' This was sung with `azhutham' and imparted a rare emotional richness to this phase of the concert. This familiar kriti was received well by the audience.The Oothukadu kriti `Thaye Yasoda' provided for a pleasant Todi interlude before Kalyani.  But when Srinivasan charmed with straight notes, Ganesh'ssangatiswere morebrigaoriented. He effectively reproduced the passages sung by his guru. Neraval for `bhujagadhipa shayana' reached majestic heights in the upper octave when Srinivasan, in full-throated splendour, unfurled themoorchanasinnishadamandrishabham.Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar deftly accompanied on the violin.  `Neerajadala nayana'(Mand), `Sreechakraraja simhasaneswari'(Ragamalika), `Sheyvadellam Sheydu Shivane'(Jonpuri) unfolded in manifold shades of emotion and musical expression. One of the most popular of bhajans of Santhanam,  `Bho Sambho Siva Sambho' in Revathi was sung next.Bottom Template Starts
