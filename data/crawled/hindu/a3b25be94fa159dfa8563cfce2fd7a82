VChaitra Sairam made an immediate impact on the listeners with her melodious, pliable voice as she began her vocal recital with the Dhanyasi varnam &#8216;Nee Intha Maayam Seithaal' by Papanasam Sivan. Pollachi Tamizhisai Sangam had featured her vocal concert at Mahatma Gandhi Mandapam, Pollachi.Most of the songs were in Tamil among which Papanasam Sivan's compositions had the lion's share. After a beautiful portrayal of Kedaragowlai, she sang &#8216;Swamikku Sari Evvare,' (Papanasam Sivan) and embellished it with a lovely niraval and swarakalpanas.Soulful renditionThe first stanza of Siva panchaksharam preceded the soulful song, &#8216;Sevikka Vendumayya' in Andholika by Muthu Thandavar. Chaitra's smoothly flowing recital seemed to gain new vibrancy after this piece. &#8216;Kaa Vaa Vaa' in Varali was also presented elaborately. &#8216;Vaa Murugaa Vaa' in Begada by R. Venugopal was pleasing. Chaitra presented chaste Khambhodi with due ornamentation and sang the lyrically rich composition, &#8216;Kaana Kan Kodi Vendum' that picturesquely describes Kapaleeswarar's procession.The lighter session included &#8216;Vellai Thaamarai Poovil Iruppaal,' &#8216;Pozhuthu Migavaachudhe' and a tillana. She also obliged a few requests from the listeners. Her style of delineating the ragas and rendering the swarakalpanas certainly reminded one of her guru Bombay Jayashri Ramnath, but fortunately, she was not trying to imitate her.The accompanying artists did a great job that day. A.G. Venkatasubramaniam, son of Anayampatti Ganesan and disciple of Parur M.A. Sundareswaran let melody flow through his well-trained fingers. Whether it was the depiction of the ragas or simple accompaniment, he did full justice to his role as an accompanying violinist. Mridangam by Delhi S. Sairam was lively and interesting. A disciple of Thiruvarur Bhaktavatsalam, he wove enjoyable rhythmic patterns, especially during the thani. There was a good understanding among the three artists and they presented a delectable aural treat.A post graduate in Psychology, Chaitra has been endowed with all the requisites of a great concert musician and by increasing her repertoire and adding a little more spirit to her presentation, will soon carve a niche for herself in the minds of her rasikas.
