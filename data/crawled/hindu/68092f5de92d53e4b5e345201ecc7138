VA sonorous voice is always an advantage. Sudha Ravi Prakash, who sang at the 110th year celebrations of Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha at Narada Gana Sabha, displayed her pleasant vocals to her advantage. The customary Hamsadhwani and &#8216;Gam Ganapathey' (Muthiah Bhagavatar) with a stretch of swarakalpana set the concert rolling.Sudha compiled her programme with kritis from Tyagaraja (&#8216;Yochana' in Darbar), Papanasam Sivan (&#8216;Ma Ramanan' in Hindolam), G.N. Balasubramaniam (&#8216;Nee Paadamegathi' in Nalinakanti), Dikshitar (&#8216;Meenakshi Memudam' in Poorvikalyani), Purandaradasa (&#8216;Narayana Ninne Namade' in Suddha Dhanyasi and &#8216;Yemanelyokana' in Sivaranjani) and Thanjavur Sankara Iyer (&#8216;Mahadeva Siva Sambho' in Revati).The raga essays were drawn briefly for Hindolam and quite expansively for Poorvikalyani. Sudha's training and diligent approach helped her develop the raga without any excesses or exuberance. Her mellifluous voice could travel freely in all sthayis without difficulty.The exercises carried precision with limited ingenuity. The result -- something seemed to be missing in Hindolam whereas Poorvikalyani was quite gratifying. Sudha's swara sections were concise. The niraval on &#8216;Meenalochani Pasa Mochani' in &#8216;Meenakshi Memudam' was illustrative of Sudha's understanding of the classical slant and her swaras were well set and neatly rounded off, taking shadjam as the focal note. Nevertheless, in the initial stages, a hairline shift from sruti as well as slight drifts off swara sthanas could be felt. Sudha should keep an eye on these aspects. However, her voice as well as these problems got settled with Poorvikalyani. K.J. Dileep supported Sudha on the violin. His swaras and ragas were competent. B. Ganapathyraman was on the percussion front with mild padding.Unusual combosSachin Patwardhan's Hindustani instrumental concert started late by nearly half an hour. Hailing from Indore, Sachin is the disciple of sarod maestro Ustad Amjad Ali Khan. So one can easily imagine the quality of music Sachin offered. He seems to have mastered both the sarod and the mandolin. He started on the sarod with Raag Shree. Resembling Kamavardhini of the Carnatic School, Sachin initially expounded the raga at a slow pace, progressed exquisitely and touched the racy passages set in three different rhythm cycles. The finale had dynamic exchanges between the sarod and the tabla that culminated into a cloudburst of melody. Agniky Joshil's fingers danced on the tabla with great control and grace.The next session was on the mandolin where Sachin played something like a medley of Raags Tilang and Malkauns. The freedom of musical expression prompts many musicians to experiment. The sound of the mandolin was understandably more pronounced than that of the sarod; but the medley's resonance was light with many unexpected and unusual combinations, which could be called adventurous.
