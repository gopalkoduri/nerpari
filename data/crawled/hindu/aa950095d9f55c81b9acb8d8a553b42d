VSudha Raghunathan's fluent voice culture practised over the years invests her recitals withazhutham. Her skill in vocal manipulation in the tara sthayi, development of gana-naya and rendition of kritis made her concert organised  by Rajalakshmi Fine Arts memorable for the rasikas. Vigorous tonal drive in every aspect of her performance stressed thesowkhyamand the rasikas  enjoyed it thoroughly. Right from the start of the Hamsadhwani varnam, "Jalajaaksha" followed by "Mahaganapathim" (Naattai), all the kirtanas were presented  in style.Fabulous raga bhavaThe raga bhava she imparted to Subhapantuvarali for "Ennaalum Urake" and Bhairavi for "Balagopala" were fabulous. The magic casement she wove in the madhyama and tara sthayis for Mohanam harnessed rich musical sentiment to illuminate the beauteous niches of the raga. The tukkadas towards the end were delicious snacks. R. K. Sreeramkumar's violin accompaniment was vibrant and imperious in his solo versions and swara repartees. Arun Prakash (mridangam) and Raman (morsing) ably provided  percussive support.T. K. GANAPATHYBottom Template Starts
