VIs it easy to present a concert full of ragas with vivadi swaras? Definitely not. So it was no wonder veteran vocalist Seetha Rajan said at the outset of her concert of vivadi ragas at the Music Academy that it was an examination for her.True, the vivadi (dissonant) notes are difficult not only to deliberate but also to make them sound pleasing.That is what has been done by great composers such as Muthuswami Dikshitar, Tyagaraja and Koteeswara Iyer, Seetha said.The  proximity of the two notes brings out the distinctive skill of these composers nonpareil as a challenge and they have done it with &#233;lan through vakra (tricky), varja (elimination), deerka (extended) and double swara techniques. Therefore, Seetha Rajan&#8217;s concert was scholarly, interestingly informative and refreshingly illustrative.Raga Choodamani (32nd Melakarata Raga Vardhani) figured first through the Dikshitar composition &#8216;Swetha ganapathim&#8217; with addition of swaras.Next was the complete vivadi swara raga Kanakambari (Kanakangi), once again from Dikshitar&#8217;s chest &#8216;Kanakambari Kaarunyamruta Lahari&#8217;.Seetha wondered the way Dikshitar had eschewed ga and ni and extended the vadi-samvadi swaras in this melody. Neethimathi, the 60th melakarta was developed in detail. The shades of Shanmukhapriya in the Poorvangam and the vivadi swaras in the Uthrangam were brought out well in her delineation.Koteeswara Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;Mohana Muthukumara&#8217; set in Roopaka talam made a compulsive hearing with an array of swaras in the end. The quick but emotive &#8216;Adu Gaaradani&#8217; in Manoranjani of Tyagaraja was illustrative of Manavathi, its origin.Rasikapriya known as Rasa Manjari in Dikshitar&#8217;s parlance, carried its allure in the kriti &#8216;Sringara Rasa Manjari&#8217; with emphasis on panchamam. Kavaambothi, 43 melakarta with semblance to Subapantuvarali known as Geervani, was presented with a brief raga prelude by Seetha.The well-known Tyagaraja numbers &#8216;Paramathmudu&#8217; in Vagadeeswari and &#8216;Gaanamoorthe&#8217; in Ganamoorthy were followed by the alapana of Jyothiswaroopini. Koteeswara Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;Gaanamutha paanam&#8217; and an engaging niraval and kalpanaswaras on &#8216;Mela Raga Rathangarathil Kadaintheduttha&#8217; turned out to be the central item of Seetha&#8217;s recital.Little known and hardly heard ragas such as Davalambari and Aatakambari were also included in Seetha&#8217;s agenda. The concert concluded with &#8216;Sri Venkata Girisa&#8217; in Surutti.Seetha Rajan is a dedicated  vocalist who approaches music with great attention and humility. In this special concert, her concern was  to  retain the raga structure, its uniqueness and attraction. Her kalpanaswara parts showed how best one could linger over the difficult dissonant notes without creating discomfort for the listener.Mullaivasal Chandramouli proved that he could match the vocalist&#8217;s ability in extracting the best of each raga whenever his turn came. J. Vaidyanathan on the mridangam supported the vocalist in keeping the concert lively  and also offered an exquisite tani avartanam.
