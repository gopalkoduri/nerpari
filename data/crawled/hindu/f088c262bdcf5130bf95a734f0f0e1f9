VThe varnam presented by artistes at the beginning of a Carnatic music concert may serve as a &#8216;warming-up' piece to many. But it also gives ample indication of their musical talents, at the very outset. This 20-year-old, still in college, too began her vocal recital with a varnam that indicated her musical talents. But the Sanskrit verse on Lord Hayagriva that preceded the varnam, in the form of a vrithum and which took only a couple of minutes, did this job too. The Chennai-based Aishwarya Shankar, who performed under the aegis of Gayathri Fine Arts past this weekend, delighted the audience with her brilliant performance of a little over two hours.Gifted with a good voice, Aishwarya brought credit to Gayathri Fine Arts for her inclusion in their Annual Concert Series.The Adi tala pada varnam composed by Lalgudi Jayaraman in raga Charukesi had considerable depth. Mysore Jayachamaraja Wodayar's &#8220;Sree Mahaganapatim bhajeham&#8221; in raga Attana provided briskness. The fast-paced kalpana swaras were rich in creativity.Aishwarya quickly moved to present a detailed rendition. Her choice was Papanasam Sivan's &#8220;Venkata ramana&#8221; in Latangi. Not only did she handle this composition well, she also presented a scintillating alap. The neraval of the phrase &#8220;Shanka chakra dharal unnai sharan adaiden Venkataramana&#8221; as well the kalpana swaras were well executed.Pace and emotionAishwarya was able to bring out the emotive contents of the lyrics as well the raga when she presented Neelakanta Sivan's &#8220;Yendraikku Siva krupai&#8221; in raga Mukhari. The fast-paced &#8220;Atukaradani palka&#8221;, a composition of Tyagaraja, taken up rarely in concerts, livened up the proceedings.The central piece of Aishwarya's concert was Subbarama Dikshitar's &#8220;Sankaracharyam&#8221; in raga Shankarabharanam. She handled this very well, with utmost care for the laya aspects of the slow-paced composition. Earlier, the detailed delineation of the raga was delightful. In between, through the technique of graha bheda, Aishwarya unfolded the raga Kambhoji briefly. Neraval as well as kalpana swara formats were elaborate.Delhi's R. Saravanan provided enthusiastic support on the violin. However, quite often he failed to rise to the occasion. These lapses were partly offset with the delightful alapana of the raga Shankarabharanam. K.N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam and N. Harinarayanan on the ghatam provided understanding support and played an enjoyable tani-avartanam in Adi tala.The depth of her music and the maturity displayed in structuring her concert is sure to take Aishwarya's career to greater heights. However, she could avoid graha bheda concepts at this stage as this might distract her focus. She should also avoid consulting books while singing, even the miscellaneous songs she presented after the tani avartanam.Aishwarya is under the tutelage of renowned musician Suguna Varadachari. She had her initial training in music from Indira Ranganathan of Kolkata and learnt the basics of pallavi singing from T. Chandramouli.
