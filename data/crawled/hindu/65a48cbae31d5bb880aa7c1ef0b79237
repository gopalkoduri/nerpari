VThe repertoire was as diverse and distinct as it should be coming from none other than Prince Rama Varma! His rendition of M. Balamuralikrishna's compositions were a replica of the maestro in tone and tenor but the rest of it was more individualistic with a trace of MBK lacing them. There's no denying that Rama Varma comes out as a dedicated musician with a royal heritage in tow. The fact that he experiences the joy of singing is visible with each and every piece he chose to present and this naturally permeates to the listeners making for a wonderful journey into the world of music. And the kritis were exceptionally rare and beautiful pieces of lyrics strung together be it Thyagaraja or Deekshitar or his ancestor Swati Tirunal.Rama Varma comes across as a dexterous vocalist who is able to reach out to the music enthusiast as well as the commoner. His light and sonorous innovation of swaras and his lucidity endear him to many an audience. The varnam in Gambheera Nata &#8216; Amba anandaroopini&#8230;' a Balamuralikrishna's composition rippled through with lovely lyrics. Spicing the presentation with little anecdotes, Rama Varma made it a very impressive recital indeed. The rare Rakshimpave&#8230; from Thyagaraja in Mayamalavagowla was splendid especially with the swaras that elegantly embossed the lines Dakshina Kailasamuna&#8230;.Similarly, another very alliterative piece from Thyagaraja Vara leela gaana lola&#8230; was rhythm at its best with the singer lending a dimension to the rise and fall of the notes. Sri Rama namam maruva&#8230; (Kuranji) was MBK all over.The musician seemed more suited to Hindustani and Western styles of singing going by the beauty of his tones when he picked up such ragas. For instance, Swati Tirunal's composition in &#8216; Desakshi' (close to Bilahari) wherein the nishadam has a Hindustani touch as well as Harikesanallur Muthaiah Bhagavatar's western notation to a syllabic beat were by far the evening's highlight. The very philosophical song Sarvam Brahmamayam&#8230; was plain singing with the underlying emotion that was called for. The tillana in Kuntala Varali rounded off the concert hosted by Saptaparni. Mridangam by Harikumar and ghatam by Kartik were stupendous while violinist R. Vinu simply excelled.
