VAs part of its weekly concert series, Nada Bharati featured young vocalist Kaivalya Kumar in a concert held at Mahati Hall in DD Colony last week. Looking at the way the series was set, this project appears to have been gaining momentum. Kumar opened with a rarevarnamKapaleeswaramin Mohana of Deekshitar followed byKanjadalayatakshiin Kamalamanohari, a vilambakalakriti. After a rareEvarikai Avataramuof Thyagaraja in Devamanohari, Kumar took upragaChandrajyothi for expansion and sang in it another rare piece of ThyagarajaShashivadana. Kharaharapriya was the nextragahe chose for delineation.  He choseJanaki Patheof Papanasam Shivan which he rendered along withswaras. The main melody of the concert was Kalyani for Thyagaraja&#8217;sEtavunarain which he added anerevalandswaraprasthara. K.Rajan&#8217;s violin support was reasonably good. A couple of Bhajans concluded the show.R.V. Panduranga Sharma figured in the previous week&#8217;s vocal recital in the company of Rajan on violin and Srinivas Gopalan on mridangam. Disciple of legendary D.K.Pattammal and also of Puranam figured in the previous week. He began with Saverivarnam, for a traditional opening.Janaki Ramanain Suddha Seemantini with complexswaraprastharain it andDevi Brovain Chintamani were interesting numbers that followed.Raga Vasantha came for brief delineation for Thyagaraja&#8217;sSeethamma Maayamma. Thyagaraja&#8217;sEtijanmamuwas a natural choice in this and was marked bynerevalandswaraprasthara.Sujanajeevana Ramain Khamas and a composition of Papanasam Sivan in Mukhari were the numbers he rendered before he went for main essay of the evening, Kharaharapriya.  Thyagaraja&#8217;sChakkani Rajamargamuwas again a popular choice presentingneravalandswarakalpanain sarvalaghu technique
