VAll India Radio&#8217;s National Programme of Music of  mid-September was dedicated to the memory of the late Carnatic violin maestro, Kunnakudi R. Vaidynathan who recently passed away in Chennai. Vaidyanathan had received some training on the violin from his father. But it was he himself who further developed a style of his own that was quite bold and robust, but, very often even aggressive. The broadcast commenced with his  leisurely rendering of a Mysore Vasudevachar kriti in the raga Gowla and followed with another by the same composer  in the colourful  raga Khamas. The programme concluded with a melodiously rendered Tyagaraja kriti  in the raga Saraswati.One felt enthralled to listen for the first time to a Hindustani classical vocal recital by the young Shoukat Hussain, the son and disciple of the Agra-Atrauli doyen Ustad Salamat Hussain. Shoukat&#8217;s style and mannerisms in singing reminded one of another great Agra-Atrauli maestro, the late Ustad Sharafat Hussain. His recital from the Ahmedabad studio of Akashvani was indeed delectable for his opening &#8216;nom-tom alap&#8217; followed by a leisurely and competently sung khayal in the raga Bihag set to a slow tempo Ek tala.  This part of the recital concluded with a charming tarana in the same raga. Khayals in the raga Rageshwari came in as a pleasing finale to young Shoukat&#8217;s commendable performance.Of late, the Western Music programme &#8220;The Classical Showcase&#8221; onAIR FM&#8217;s Rainbow channel seems to have lost its earlier charm, probably owing to a lack of proper planning and able compeering. Recently &#8220;Chayan&#8221; featured a delightful programme with Hindustani vocal recital by the late Ustad Sarfaraz Hussain Khan with ragas Kedar, Hamir and Bageshwari. The late Ustad belonged to the Rampur-Saheswan traditions. He had excellent accompaniment by his eldest son and disciple Ustad Muzahid Hussain Khan, as also on the sarangi by Asif Ali Khan and on the tabla by the late Dayem Ali Qadri.As always the Gandharva channel of World Space Radio  had an extravaganza of rich Hindustani instrumental music, commencing with Ustad Ali Akbar Khan&#8217;s sarod recital in the raga Bhimpalasi. Unfortunately, the recording quality was not at all good.  The instrument sounded as if just picked out of a tub of water. Next came  a duet in Piloo with Pandit Ravi Shankar on the sitar and  Yehudi Menuhin on the violin. A brief alap-jod followed with a mid-tempo gat-toda in a mid-tempo Teen tala of 16 beats.  Menuhin&#8217;s meanderings on the first string (E) of his violin delighted for his  neat and crisp phrasings with intense melodic appeal. The mid-tempo Teen tala composition was replete with pleasing posers and retorts between the two.The third presentation was Ustad Sabri Khan&#8217;s immaculate sarangi recital in the raga Multani with a brief alap and a Teen tala composition. Quite a few of his fast and sweepingly inserted phrases were indeed impressive. Ustad Amjad Ali Khan&#8217;s alap-jod in Gaud Sarang delighted for his neat and tuneful meanderings. Of the two gat-todas rendered with pleasingly permuted phrasings the last one was a good old vintage piece. Gaurav Mazumdar&#8217;s sitar recital with over prolonged alap-jod-jhala in the raga Patdeep was disappointing since he failed to highlight the true character of the melody. The total absence of the gat-toda rendering could possibly be   due to editing of the recording. The shehnai and violin duet respectively between Ustad Bismillah Khan and Pandit V.G. Jog was a pleasing item comprising Banaras folk music (kajari-chaiti).
