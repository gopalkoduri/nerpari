VSree Shanmukhananda Sangeetha Sabha&#8217;s flagship series, Tyagaraja Music Festival, this year was bereft of &#8216;big ticket&#8217; artistes and dance programmes.Their long list of awardees too has been reduced to just one. Renowned violinist T.N. Krishnan, who turned 80 recently, was, conferred &#8216;Nada Kalanidhi&#8217; during this festival held in New Delhi recently.T.N. Krishnan also presented an enlivening recital soon after the award ceremony. His ragam-thanam-pallavi session, the main item of his recital, was an elaborate one.The pallavi was in four ragas namely, Sankarabaranam, Todi, Kalyani and Darbar and set to Adi tal. After presenting a detailed sketch of Sankarabaranam raga, Krishnan presented melodious tanam in all the four ragas. The session concluded with swaraprastharas in all these ragas.Earlier, Krishnan presented two of Tyagaraja&#8217;s compositions, namely, &#8216;Siva siva siva yanarada&#8217; in the raga Pantuvarali and &#8216;Sogasuga mridanga&#8217; in the raga Sriranjani.In the former composition, improvisations were in the form of a fine alap of the raga, niraval of a phrase from the charanam of the composition and swaraprastharas flowing in the form of rich and creative formats. Krishnan was ably assisted by K.V. Prasad on the mridangam and H. Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam.The duo&#8217;s taniavartanam in Adi tal was captivating.For Krishnan, who started playing from the age of eight, his present age factor has not withered his musical acumen. But, for the Sabha, which has completed 59 years of existence in the Capital, their organisational skills seem to have withered.It couldn&#8217;t get Krishnan&#8217;s accompanying artistes on the stage on time, resulting in delayed start of the concert. Krishnan did utilize this time to recite interesting anecdotes of his yesteryears, on the subject of punctuality.In another concert during this series, the organisation got its mathematics wrong.After honouring four out of five performing artistes on the dais with angavasthrams, there was no angavasthram left for the fifth artiste.In another concert in this series, intelligent structuring of the concert as well as the understanding support of the accompanying artistes played crucial roles in translating the concert into a memorable experience for the rasikas. Vocalist Sangeetha Sivakumar&#8217;s opening piece itself, Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Meru Samana&#8217; in the raga Mayamalava gowla, had considerable depth. The niraval and swaraprastharas that she presented towards the end of this composition brought out her manodharma talents to the fore, at the very outset.Tyagaraja&#8217;s another composition, &#8216;Manasa etulortune&#8217; in the raga Malaya marutam and the subsequent swaraprastharas in fast tempo kept the proceedings lively.Sangeetha handled well &#8216;Eti janmamidi&#8217; in the raga Varali and &#8216;Evari mata&#8217; in the raga Kambhoji (both compositions of Tyagaraja&#8217;s). While she presented detailed and fine sketches of both these ragas, further improvisations for the later composition were in the form of niraval and swaraprastharas which were rich in creativity.VVS Murari on the violin and Shertalai Ananthakrishnan on the mridangam provided enthusiastic and excellent support throughout the concert and contributed significantly to it.Murari&#8217;s delineation of ragas Varali and Kambhoji and Ananthakrishnan&#8217;s taniavartanam in Adi tal were delightful. On the whole, a good team work.
