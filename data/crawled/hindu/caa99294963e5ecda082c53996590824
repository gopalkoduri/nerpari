VNada Bharathi is doing appreciable service to the cause of classical music in the twin cities, specially in encouraging local talent. It conducts weekend concerts and on Sunday it featured a veena duet of the sisters, Bandi Syamala, a senior veena artiste of the twin cities and Subbulakshmi.The sisters started off with theSaranga Varnam, dished out in a brisk manner. Syamala immediately jumped in to analapanaof Kambhoji. The leisurely pace at which thealapanastarted made the listener expect a detailed elaboration but she chose to play some good phrases and end it quickly.Lambodara,a rarely heardkrithi, was played with good conventionalsangathis, followed by a crispneravalandswarakalpana.The beauty of a small hall is the close interaction of the artistes and rasikas as evidenced on Sunday. The audience was witness to the real, unamplified sound quality of the instruments when the electricity went off for a few moments. It was such a pleasure enhanced by thepakkavadyamsadjusting their playing style to suit the sudden lower volume of the veenas. A fastParaloka Bhayain Mandari followed Kambhoji. Then Subbulakshmi took up Hindolam for a detailedalapana. Her imagination was full ofraga-bhavaand was expressed skilfully. The ever popularSamajavaragamanawas played to everyone&#8217;s delight. Dikshitar&#8217;s lovelykrithi,Akilandeshwariin Dwijavanthi was played with emotion by the sisters. A high quality delineation of Kalyani by Syamala followed in a soothing pace and was embedded with many good phrases. As per the tradition, they played thethanamand at a no-rush pace, following it up withNidhichala Sukhamaof Thyagaraja. Thethaniwas a part of the main piece, Kalyani, and was essayed very well by thepakka vadyams. Throughout the concert, mridang player Srinivas Gopalan played with very good expectation of thesangathis. His understanding of the mood of the song enhanced the listening pleasure. Hanumantha Rao gave active support on the ghatam in maintaining the level of the concert.The concert ended with a couple of quick items likeSmaravaram,Sri Kamalambikeand others.
