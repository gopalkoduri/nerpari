VI have a dream. And it is to tell the younger generation of India how beautiful and great Indian music is&#8221;. That was Pandit Ronu Majumdar, renowned Bansuri virtuoso who held the audience spellbound during his recent concert in Mysore at the just-concluded Dasara festival.Taking time off before the concert Majumdar, spoke at length of his musical journey, his future plans and Mysore.&#8220;Mysore is always special to me as I had come here immediately after my marriage. I love the city, the ambience and it is a great pleasure playing in front of the illuminated palace&#8221;, said the maestro whose albums and individual ragas have won rave reviews.Rooted in the Maihar Gharana Majumdar learnt flute from his father Bhanu Majumdar and later from Pandit Laxman Prasad Jaipurwale and Pandit Vijay Raghav Rao whom he credits with elevating Bansuri from a folk instrument to its present classical status.Among the few artistes who is as much at ease with jazz as with Hindustani or music Majumdar attributed it to his solid grounding in classical music. &#8220;Training has to be perfect and during the initial training period I was rooted to classical music which helped me experiment later.&#8221;&#8220;I derive inspiration from various sources which helps me to understand other genres of music and respect the artistes.&#8221; Majumdar, who at a young age teamed up with legendary guitarists like Ry Cooder and Larry Cordle, says: &#8220;It was by playing with Ustad Zakir Hussain that I learnt how to be down to earth and humble&#8221;.Noted for his wide repertoire of music and fascination for jugalbandi Majumdar finds fusion of Hindustani and Carnatic music enchanting but warns youngsters of the need to be rooted in the classical before experimenting with fusion.&#8220;Indian fusion is not about stomping out the listener with voluminous sound ending in a deafening crescendo. Rather I consider the jugalbandi a meeting of the minds where the two artistes respect and understand each other&#8221;, said Majumdar who named saxophone player Kadari Gopalnath, Bombay Jayashree, Mysore Manjunath and Ravi Kiran as some of the artists with whom he gels well.Majumdar is optimistic about the present generation of artists and the future of classical music. &#8220;There is no vacuum and the new crop of artists is good with plenty of talent like Amit Nadig and T. M. Krishna or my own student Shivalingappa who is maturing fast&#8221;. So is the new generation of listeners and here one must credit SPICMACAY which is doing a phenomenal job in creating greater understanding and awareness about Indian music, Majumdar adds.His latest album &#8220;Ronu and Friends&#8221; released some time ago is about his life&#8217;s journey as a musician and has won critical acclaim. &#8220;It speaks of my life and travails as a musician and I teamed up with Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt (Mohan Veena), Kadri and others who shared my joys and agony in life and is a tribute to them&#8221;, says Majumdar whose album has also been described as depicting his journey as a musician from his younger days to present times.&#8220;It is part of my dream to inspire the younger generation as much as possible about the beauty and greatness of Indian music. This album has many maestros in their respective field and has attempted to reflect India&#8217;s rich musical heritage,&#8221; says Majumdar whose penchant for exploration has not diminished and is experimenting with a new variety of flute, that he has designed. &#8220;I have called it Shank Bansuri as it sounds like a shank or conch and I normally play it during the conclusion of my concerts&#8221;, which he did to wind off the memorable concert to a standing ovation by a large audience.
