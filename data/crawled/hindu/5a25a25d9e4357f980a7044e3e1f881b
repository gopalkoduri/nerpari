V&#8216;Divakara Thanujam&#8217; (Yadhukulakhambodhi), a Navagraha Stotra Kriti, was the commencement piece. Rendering &#8216;Sri Guruna Palithosmi&#8217; (Padi) Sowmya mentioned that this was one of the oldest ragas of our tradition evidenced by the many researched Annamacharya compositions and added that the most familiar specimen in vogue is the one that was sung.There was a neat and brief alapana of Mohanam and &#8216;Narasimha Agachcha&#8217; was sung &#8212; the tongue-twister madhyamakala lyrics rendered with a clear diction.&#8216;Soundara Rajam&#8217; (Brindavana Saranga) followed. &#8216;Sivakami Pathim&#8217; (Nattakurinji) had pace  and rang  in variety. The venba like &#8216;Narmadha Kaveri&#8217; (Namadesi), a four-line cameo,  brought to light the poetic mastery of Dikshitar. &#8216;Tyagarajaya Namaste&#8217; (Begada) had a buzzing raga alapana, while &#8216;Veena Pusthaka&#8217; (Vegavauhini) advocated  Dikshitar&#8217;s prescription  for the depressed.The main kriti was &#8216;Bhajare Re Chitha&#8217; (Kalyani) where the alapana had creativity augmented with caution. Niraval and swaras came at the word-filled, &#8216;Bhaava Raga Thala Modhinim.&#8217;The demonstrative kalpanaswaras for ragas such as  Padi and Namadesi were introduced  with  ease and purpose.R.K.Shriram Kumar (violin) had fine, measured phrases in  the raga alapanas and his accompanying style both served and enhanced the value of the concert. Sudhindhra (mridangam) and Karthik (Ghatam) provided laya support. They drew special encomiums from the main artiste for their tani.The concert &#8212; a Dikshitar walk through of precious quality &#8212; was held at the Narada Gana Sabha Mini Hall, as part of the  P. Obul Reddy Endowment Series.
