Varalakshmi Anandakumar exhibited her presentation skills besid\u000aes handling the numbers with confidence at her vocal concert during the  Sadguru Thyagaraja Aradhana Celebration held at  Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Coimbatore.  Her buoyant start of &#8216;Sami Daya&#8217; varnam in Kedaragowla followed by &#8216;Vathapi Ganapathim&#8217; in Hamsadhwani with swaras were dainty in the articulation of the sahitya casting a spell on the listeners. &#8216;Entharo Mahanubhavulu&#8217;  was rendered with restraint and relish. Her impressive raga alapana of Bahudari to render &#8216;Brovabarama&#8217; with sahitya bhava delighted the rasikas. The edifice of Kalyani raga for the kriti, &#8216;Bhajana Seyave&#8217; and Kharaharapriya for the kriti, &#8216;Chakkaniraja&#8217; were  built around sensitive and perceptive sancharas and the interpretation of the kritis brought out the radiance of the compositions. The closing virutham and Thiruppugazh hymn were rendered with  gracefulness.Usha&#8217;s violin accompaniment  and swara sallies were commendable. The percussive wing comprising Jayaprakash (mridangam), Suresh (ghatam), Sundaram (kanjira) and Arumugham (morsing)  provided perfect rhythm at the right decibels including a vibrant thani.Bangalore Shankar&#8217;s vocal concert during the Purandaradasar aradhana celebration at  Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan auditorium was marked by his strict adherence to tradition. The recital showed his involvement  and knowledge of music. His presentation of Dasar kritis revealed his substantive vidwath softened with performing finish. His metallic voice  scored in his interpretation of all the numbers he had chosen for the kutcheri. Following the opening winsome delivery of &#8216;Vandisuvudu&#8217; in Nattai, his Kalyani alapana traversing the sthayis in perfect alignment to sruthi for the kriti, &#8216;Nambi Kettavarillavo&#8217; with niraval and swaras was enjoyable. The other kritis included, &#8216;Venkatachala,&#8217; &#8216;Narayana Ninna,&#8217; &#8216;Krishna Nee,&#8217; &#8216;Kaliyuga&#8217; and &#8216;Jagadoddharana.&#8217; The piece de resistance of the musical session was his alapana mapping the contours of Khambodi with telling musical phrases for the kriti, &#8216;O! Rangasayee&#8217; with an exuberant niraval at &#8216;Bhooloka Vaikunta&#8217; and swaras delivered with delectable artistry.Usha&#8217;s violin accompaniment etched the beauty  of all the ragas in her solo versions. Jayaprakash&#8217;s rhythmic spontaneity in mridangam was discernible throughout with the support of Sundaram (kanjira) and Arumugham  (morsing).
