VTwo Hindustani vocal recitals of short duration were organised last week in the port city under the aegis of the local chapter of SPIC-MACAY. Octogenarian vocalist of great international repute and recipient of the prestigious Kalidas Samman and the Sangeet Natak Akademi honour besides Padma Bhushan, Ustad Rahim Fahimuddin Khan Dagra, was the artiste. He rendered the concerts at Samudrika and Manasi Auditoriums, respectively, of the Naval Dock Yard and the NSTL.Emanating sublime naada by way of rendering Om in impeccably perfect alignment with the pristine purity of the notes, Sa and Pa, the Ustad seemed to have gone deeply into a meditative trance. Then rendering compositions in Poorvi in Choutaal elaborately with aalap and sargam, Thodi in Teental similarly and briefly in Bhairav in Dhamara (14 beats) and Sooltaal , he took the houseful audience on an ecstatic trip.His aalaps in particular left an impression of being exquisite expatiations of the characteristic attributes of the divinity of classicism ordained in Indian music. Parveen Aliya, in his early 30s, enchantingly proved himself a peer to the artiste in the Ustad in achieving consummate mastery in the art of playing on the pakhawaz Executing erudite thani in his turn, he cast an equally captivating spell like the Ustad.
