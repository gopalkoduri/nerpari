VListening to her Begada was like being drenched in a pleasant steady drizzle that cools your body and mind (&#8216;Tyagaraajaaya Namaste,&#8217; Dikshitar).After a neat Purvikalyani alapana, she rendered Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Ksheera Saagara Saayee&#8217; with a moving niraval for the line, &#8216;Unadharul Indri Inbamumundo&#8217; following it with kalpanaswaras.When she began Dhanyasi, the very first phrase was brimming with the raga swarupa and after a fulfilling alapana, she sang &#8216;Meenalochani Brova&#8217; (Syama Sastri). However even her exquisite Thodi (being very similar to Dhanyasi) could not prevent people from wondering whether she could have taken some other raga for the RTP.The pallavi, &#8216;Daasharathe, Karuna Payonidhe, Paahi&#8217; was rendered very well, with swaras in different ragas.&#8216;Endhuku Nirdaya Evarunnaarura&#8217; in Harikhambodi by Tyagaraja was presented well with all the charanas.&#8216;Yajnaadhulu Sukhamanuvaariki&#8217; in Jayamanohari by Tyagaraja was pleasant. Dikshithar&#8217;s &#8216;Sri Kaalahastheesa&#8217; (Huseni) sparkled in her clear diction. After a soulful viruttam in ragamalika, she concluded with &#8216;Sri Kaantha Enagishtu Dayamaado&#8217; (Purandaradasar) and &#8216;Enna Solli Azhaithaal Nee Varuvaayo&#8217; (Ambujam Krishna).Amritha Murali followed the vocalist faithfully on the violin and presented authentic alapanas. Trivandrum Balaji gave solid support on the mridangam and lifted the concert.There were no torrential swaras, no reaching dizzying heights and no efforts to win applause. Sumithra, like her mentor, shared her &#8216;aradhana&#8217; through music and those who have a taste for this kind of quiet music would have loved her concert.
