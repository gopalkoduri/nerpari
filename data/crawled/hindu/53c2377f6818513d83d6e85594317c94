VMellowing of madhyasthaayi kirtanas was the unique feature of renowned flautist K.S. Gopalakrishnan's concert at Kalikkotta Palace, Thripunithura.Beginning with &#8216;Chalamela,' a varnam in Darbar by Thiruvottiyur Thyagayya, K.S. Gopalakrishnan, better known as KSG, continued the recital with Dikshitar's &#8216;Swaminatha paripalaya' in Natta, by playing in a slow beat.Serene and soothingThe Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Thulaseedala' (Mayamalavagowla) was very soothing and created a serene mood. &#8216;Maara vairi ramani,' another popular kriti of Tyagaraja's in Nasikaabhooshani, was a good selection since very few kritis have been composed in this raga, even though it is a melakartha raga. It is also important to note that such a raga, which has half notes, is difficult to play on the flute. KSG played it well and with ease, without sidelining the possibilities of raga or losing its bhava. It was an indication of his comfort with the instrument, a fact that was highlighted throughout the concert.His distinction in his field was evident by his novel aalaap of Arabhi. He maintained the bhava even while traversing the deepest note of the raga. &#8216;Narasimha mamava' by Swati Tirunal was the kriti he took for that. Surprisingly KSG took Madhyamavathi as the main raga of the day, where he raised the bar of innovation. He revealed unidentified possibilities in the raga.Excellent accompanimentT.H. Subrahmaniam, on the violin, accompanied him well. Both Changanassery B. Harikumar (mridangam) and Perunkavu P.L. Sudheer (ghatam) were in their usual superb form all throughout the concert, especially during tani.During the thukkadas too, KSG used the regular patterns of swara combinations in intervals. He played &#8216;Palukkebangaramayena' (Ananda Bhairavi) by Bhadrachala Ramadas and &#8216;Thamburumeettidhava' (Sindhu Bhairavi) by Purandaradasa with ease. His experience enabled him to confidently innovate much to the admiration of rasikas.Even though KSG already elaborately played Madhyamavathi raga, he left his masterpiece &#8216;Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma' for the last. In all it was a majestic concert since very few can go to such heights in &#8216;gayaka baani' as KSG. The concert was held in memoriam of the late K.C. Kalyana Sundara Bhagavathar.
