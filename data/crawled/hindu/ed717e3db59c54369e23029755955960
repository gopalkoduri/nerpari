VValsan Menon sang under the aegis of JSS Sangeetha Sabha as part of the Sabha's 17th Annual Music Conference, Mysore. The singer started his concert with a varna of Lalgudi Jayaraman, &#8220;Jalajaksha Ni Padamule&#8221; in Asaveri. Softly resonating voice was all set to animate such a pleasing musical work as this, set to a raga - melting and expressive.Singer's overall approach was something definitely distinguishing in that it had pronounced preferences to the lyrics and their relevant moods. To meet this end, he has moulded his voice carefully and tastefully so that he could at will materialise his imaginations with a sense of aesthetics and tradition. His animating expressions transformed the chosen compositions into experiences tempting for repeated listening.Unfurling artistry rendered another presentation, &#8220;Jagadaanandakaaraka&#8221; of Thyagaraja (Naata) unique in matters of both narrative aspect and the manner of embellishing the composition. Instead of singing the notations in the charana sections, the innovative singer framed kalpanaswaras for the pallavi section, interspersing the passages with movements selected from the original notations so that the musical substance contained in the original work was carefully preserved and rightly complemented for more advantages.&#8220;Brochevarevarura&#8221; of Mysore Vasudevacharya was his selection for prime elaborations and embellishments, which also served as fertile ground for the percussionists to exhibit their scholarly extempore. The listeners enjoyed a convincing, pleasing and melodious neraval at &#8220;Athuramuga Karirajuni&#8221; followed by kalpanaswaras. Nevertheless, there were areas which suffered out-of-tune movements which he could have avoided with due care.Equalling the lead artiste, the melody accompanist, Avanishwaram Vinu raised himself to great heights with his lyric-oriented and mood-enhancing curves, and the learned percussionists B. Ravishankar (mridanga) and Guruprasanna (khanjira) matched themselves with the singer's exemplary style and gentle chords, keeping in mind the gravity and the dignity of the compositions.The concert included interesting numbers like &#8220;Enduku Dayaradura&#8221; (Todi &#8211; Thyagaraja - with an alapana and neraval at &#8220;Taaraka Charitha&#8221;), &#8220;Parama Purusha Jagadishwara&#8221; (Vasantha-Swathi Tirunal), &#8220;Thyagaraja Yoga Vaibhavam&#8221; (Anandabhairavi-Thyagaraja) and so on.On The fourth day, Rama Mani sang accompanied by Govindaswamy (violin), V. Krishna (mridanga) and P.N. Ramesh (ghata).She sings with a pleasing and silvery voice that is potent enough to express the divine sentiments one may expect to emerge from compositions like &#8220;Deva Deva Kalayami&#8221; (Mayamalavagoula - Swathi Tirunal), &#8220;Aadamodi Galadhe&#8221; (Charukeshi-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Shri Krishnam Bhaja&#8221; (Todi-Dikshithar) and the like.The senior artiste elaborated the ragas with fluency and verve; yet one felt that they could have been more imaginative and analytical. Further, her attempt to materialise shrutibheda in Todi, though deserved appreciation, was not satisfying. Excepting a few shades of Kalyani, for a while it was not clear as the nature of the other movements that followed.On the other hand, alapana in Mukhari (&#8220;Ksheenamai Thiruga&#8221; - Thyagaraja) struck a distinct contrast with both Charukeshi and Todi in clarity, melody and the style of presentation.
