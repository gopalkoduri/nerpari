VPrasanna Sitharama Mandira, Mysore, had arranged O.S. Thyagarajan&#8217;s concert as part of its Ramanavami celebrations. Mysore M. Manjunath (violin), Delhi Sairam (mridanga) and Guruprasad (ghata) accompanied the veteran.The singer&#8217;s magisterial voice, keeps the audience riveted to his charming style. Though he was scholarly it still left a lacuna as for a tranquilising effect, the ragas and the krithis, which he had selected, were supposed to create.Moreover, had he included at least one composition for a slow rendition, the concert would have been ideal. &#8220;Koluvaiyunnade&#8221; (Bhairavi - Thyagaraja), presented in a pleasing slow-medium pace, fortified with gentle graces compensated this dearth. Elaborate scholarly alapana was an admirable introduction to the lyrics of serene beauty. The swarakalpanas amply supported the import of the lyrics.Another composition &#8220;Eti Janmamidi&#8221; (Varali-Thyagaraja) featured the same merits; he improvised the sahitya  at &#8220;Saagarashayanuni&#8221;. Articulations with pleasing glides and terse graces establishing the emotive aspects of the raga and the lyrics by both the singer and the melody accompanist elevated the listeners to a state consummation.It was a different impact when the swarakalpana was concerned.In these areas, the construction of the swarakalpana, though masterly, somehow could not harmonise with the delicacies of either the raga or the text.Other inclusions were &#8220;Rama Nannu&#8221; (Harikamboji - Thyagaraja). &#8220;Evarani&#8221; (Devamruthavarshini - Thyagaraja), &#8220;Evarura&#8221; (Mohana - Thyagaraja) and so on.***Kinkini celebrated its Silver Jubilee at Jaganmohan Palace auditorium, Mysore. A series of dance recitals by renowned artistes marked the grand occasion for three days.The inaugural show was by Dr. Vasundhara Doraswamy (Bharathanatya) accompanied by Ramesh Chadaga (vocal), Sandesh Bhargav (nattuvanga), Hanumantharaju (mridanga), Manjunath (morsing and rhythm pad) and Mahesh (flute).The mature artiste&#8217;s repertoire unfurled incessantly, characterised by acuteness in the vinyasas, geometrical symmetry in the postures and mesmerising expressions in the abhinaya.Timing, balance and proportion governed the choreography, and on-the-stage inputs and improvisations lent charismatic charm and appeal. As a result, Geetha Seetharam&#8217;s, Padavarna (Swaamiya Karethare) in Amrithavarshini  was defined by refinement and aesthetic requirements.Observe how the dance passages at pallavi served as a fitting overture to the subject matter. Slow tempo laid down a firm foundation for the visual display of the very core of the abhinaya, Shringara, which progressively ripened with further evolvements.Intricate and interesting jathis liberally incorporating cross-rhythm effects featured adavus and the arudhis.Varieties of mukthaya-patterns and gracefully assumed postures, were other elements extending tenable support to the above observations.Proportion and quantum of nritha and abhinaya were in conformity with the nature of the construction and varied dimensions of the mood ingrained in the purvanga and the uttaranga of the composition.Observe for substantiation: Naayaki imploring her Sakhi shrouded with uncertainties as to her beguiling Lord&#8217;s favourable reciprocation (pallavi); sequences describing allurements she makes to press the maiden into a mediation (charana); and beatific portrayal of Krishna and Naayikas&#8217;s serene romantic fervour (ettugade section).&#8220;Jagadodharana&#8221; (Kaapi-Purandaradasa) was another highlight. The competent accompanists keeping abreast with the lead artiste&#8217;s expertise enhanced the visual appeal.
