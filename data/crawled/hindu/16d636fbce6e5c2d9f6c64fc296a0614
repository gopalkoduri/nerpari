VLakshmi Rajagopal's vocal concert took place recently in Tiruchi as the final segment of the monthly &#8216;Eppadi Paadinaro' music series, organised by Rasika Ranjana Sabha and Sri Krishna Sweets.Starting the concert with a Saurashtra varnam (&#8216;Sri Ganapathini'), she sailed past sweetly in Bowli (&#8216;Sriman Narayana') and Vasantha (&#8216;Takshi'). Her Khambodi (&#8216;Gnanamu') was extensive.Lakshmi's Sankarabharanam elaboration (&#8216;Saroja Dala') with rich swara sallies and sangatis in her commanding voice was engaging. Her ragamalika (&#8216;Petrathai') followed by Revathi (&#8216;Maha Siva Sambho') and Khamas tillanas cast a spell on the rasikas.The AIR artists T.H. Vasantha and Tiruchi Rengarajan gave able support on the violin and mridangam respectively. Rengarajan's thani was absorbing.
