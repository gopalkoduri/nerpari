VThe Visakhapatnam chapter of SPIC-MACAY had the good fortune of hosting the veteran among exponents of Indian classical vocal (Hindustani), Ustad Abdul Rashid Khan. The 103-year-old Ustadji stands recognised all over the globe as the greatest exponents of the Gwalior Gayaki. Recipient of many awards including that of the Sangeet Natak Akademi, ITC and the Kashi Swar Ganga, he also stands conferred with several titles.He performs khayal, drupad, dhamaar, tirvat and thumri styles of Hindustani vocal felicitously and astonishing expertise. He is known to have performed overnight concerts without showing signs of stress. He attributes his present strength even at the age of 103 to his soulful study of the Quran besides doing namaaz regularly. A prolific composer with more than 2,000 bandishes to his credit, he stands regarded as the senior most guru by all at the ITC Sangeet Research Academy, Kolkata.SPIC MACAY organised his recital at Samdurika A.C. auditorium, Vishakapatnam, mainly for the pupils of the schools of the Naval Base last Thursday. His disciples Subhomoi Bhattacharya and Asad Ali Khan lent vocal support, Bilal Khan was on tabla and Hafiz Ahmed Khan was on harmonium (all from Kolkata).After elaborative rendering of compositions in Raag Bhupali and Malkauns, both adorned with expansive alaaps and sargams, he also sang a bhajan and a thumri.It was amazing to see him traverse full three octaves with the same intensity and felicity in voice while doing alaapana, besides singing the compositions with the same ease negotiating taal in all the three tempos. He appeared to be perfection and artistry personified. He kept the young students spellbound.
