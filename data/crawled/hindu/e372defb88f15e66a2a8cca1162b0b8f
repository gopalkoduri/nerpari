VBarkha Ritu, the music festival organised by The Banyan Tree resonated to the sruti of torrential rains which poured interminably throughout the event in Bangalore.Surprisingly, the thumri, kajri, jhoola vocal recital of Devaki Pandit as announced by the organizers, turned out to be a Hindustani Khayal recital. Devaki Pandit&#8217;s predilections towards khayal gayaki were clearly, unmistakably discernible. Devaki Pandit commenced her recital with a vilambit khayal in a beautiful monsoon melody of the Malhar Ang, Gaud Malhar. The bandish &#8220;Ja re tu badra door jaha mora kaantha basere&#8221; in vilambit teental of 16 beats unfurled through expansive and melodious alaap in avartans (rhythmic cycles), bol alap and bol taans. Pt. Vyasmurthy Katti accompanying the vocalist on the harmonium accentuated the &#8216;pakkad&#8217; of the raga, with many creative variations in alap and gamak taans. The chota khayal bandish in Gaud Malhar &#8220;Kari Kari Badariya&#8221; in the faster drut ektal had some brilliant taankari. Pt. Ravindra Yawagal&#8217;s tabla accompaniment matched the exuberance of the taans.This was followed by two other rain ragas: Soor Malhar and Suha Malhar. The medium tempo (Madhya laya) bandish in teental in Soor Malhar &#8220;Badarwa barsan ko aye&#8221; immortalised by Kishori Amonkar in her legendary &#8216;Malhar Malika&#8217; series brought out by HMV was a rather attenuated rendition of the melody.The composition in Suha Malhar&#8220;Na jare na jare piya pyare&#8221; in drut teental, sonorously articulated by the vocalist conveyed the romantic splendour of Malhar. But it was undoubtedly in her spirited rendition of the soulful Kajri in raga Manch Kamaj &#8220;Savan Ki ritu ayiri sajaniya&#8221; set to the lilting Keherwa that Devaki Pandit stole the hearts of the audience.Renowned Santoor maestro Pt Shiv Kumar Sharma chose the pentatonic melody Megh Malhar, a melody which harks back to the period of Mughal king Akbar and his court musician Miya Tansen for his presentation. The meditative alap in Megh was characterised by certain unusual improvisatory combinations which added to the legendary mythical dimensions of the raga. Pt. Shiv Kumar Sharma energetically explored several possibilities of the Rag and this was a pleasant discovery for the Bangalore connoisseurs of Hindustani music.The customary three tiered alap-jhod&#8211; jhala was followed by a gat composition in jhap taal, a rhythmic cycle of 10 beats. The composition in the &#8216;dhamar&#8217; style had immense soothing appeal. The maestro&#8217;s precise landings on the &#8216;sam&#8217; at every avartan reverberated to the lively tabla accompaniment by Pt. Yogesh Samsi. Pt. Shiv Kumar Sharma concluded his recital with Rag Desh. He rendered two compositions in dadra and teental in this Rag. His treatment of the raga was so uniquely idiosyncratic, unequivocally bearing the stamp of his genius.Flashes of the &#8216;Loksangeet melodies&#8217; and ragas like Jaijaivanti, Kirwani, Miya ki Malhar in his delineation of raga Desh spontaneously elicited many an adulatory &#8216;Wah, wah!&#8217; of appreciation from the audience.
