VIncredible String Bends2010 String Temple Records\u000aR. Parthasarathy - Carnatic\u000aInstrumental\u000aPrice not mentionedWith the dwindling number of veena concerts in the current Carnatic music scenario, the audio compact disc under review should be a solace to the rasikas of this divine instrument.R. Parthasarathy, a senior veena artist, is well known as one who has provided instrumental support to many South Indian film songs. The disc commences with Muthuswami Dikshitar's Amruthavarshini creation &#8216;Anandamrutha.' Parthasarathy has amazing control over the instrument and his fingering technique frequently covers the three octaves during his raga playing. The kalpanaswaras for the first number are reflective of his grip over laya. While most part of Parthasarathy's playing is pleasant, there is a tendency to be dramatic at times, which robs the music of coming close to a vocal rendition.Periasamy Thooran's &#8216;Samaganapriye' (Anandabhairavi) and Tyagaraja's &#8216;Nenarunchinanu' (Malavi) serve as fillers before a brief exposition of Hindolam. The chosen kriti &#8216;Govardhana Gireesam' (Rupakam-Muthuswami Dikshitar) has a couple of sangatis aimed at projecting instrumental dexterity.The main piece of this album is the popular Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Nidhichaala' in Kalyani. The raga, kriti, niraval and swara suite are a mature display.&#8216;Sri Chakraraja' (Ragamalika-Agasthiyar) and the Desh raga thillana of Lalgudi Jayaraman are the tail pieces.The percussive support by Srimushnam Raja Rao (mridangam ) and E.M. Subramaniam (ghatam) is in perfect tune with the vainika's thought process. Their tani avartanam in Misra Chapu is engaging.
