VShri Krishna Gaana Sabha\u000ahad arranged R.K.\u000aPadmanabha's veena\u000aconcert. P.S. Shridhar\u000a(mridanga) and Kumaraswamy\u000a(ghata) accompanied\u000ahim.The acclaimed artiste's\u000astrong predisposition to explore\u000athe instrument technically\u000ato the maximum,\u000acreated an atmosphere of\u000awonder. Nevertheless, it also\u000acarried with it more limitations\u000athan merits.Gushing manodharma\u000alost its ideal purpose: the\u000aspirit of the sublime. As a\u000aresult, neither the instrument's\u000acharm nor the serenity\u000aof music could emerge\u000auntarnished. In addition,\u000athere were frequent instances\u000aof tripping because\u000aof labyrinthine articulations.An excellent display of\u000amajesty impregnated in\u000a"Shrinivasa Nannu Brovarada"\u000a(Varna- Veena Subbanna)\u000aand "Gajananayutham"\u000a(Chakravaka-Dikshitar) was\u000aone of the examples to prove\u000ahow the artiste was capable\u000aof instilling an ambience of\u000amusical radiance: blend of\u000askill, dexterity and imagination.Control over plucking\u000atechnique brought about required\u000avariations in volume\u000aand tone in furtherance\u000awith the general mood of the\u000acomposition, "Mokshamu\u000aGalada" (Saaramati - Thyagaraja).\u000aObserve passages like\u000a"Sakshatkara Ni", "Pranaanala\u000aSamyogamu" and "Veena\u000aVaadana Loludou".Nevertheless, alapana in\u000aBilahari followed by "Inthakannanandamemi"\u000a(Thyagaraja)\u000adid not bring out the\u000adevotional elements in the\u000acomposition . When such\u000acompositions are under interpretations,\u000ait is hard to\u000aaccept any redundant or\u000aflashy strains.Kalyani ("Ethavunara" -\u000aThyagaraja) once again demonstrated\u000atangled movements\u000aand overflowing\u000aflashy special effects. The\u000apercussionists' efforts\u000aworked more as a submissive\u000abackdrop.Deepika T.S. presented\u000aher maiden performance\u000a(Rangapravesha) under the\u000aauspices of Vasundhara Performing\u000aArts Centre. An ardent\u000atoil has now fructified\u000ainto a mature feat. The\u000ayoung danseuse reached\u000acommendable heights that\u000aeven professionals aspired to\u000areach. Guru Vasundhara Doraswamy\u000a(nattuvanga), Vasudha\u000aBalakrishna (vocal),\u000aNarayan (violin), Hanumantharaju\u000a(mridanga), Manjunath\u000a(rhythm pad) and\u000aMahesh (flute) accompanied\u000aher.Choreography was good,\u000aand the artiste executed the\u000achallenging task with grace\u000aand readiness.Lively activities adorned\u000athe stage. An appreciable\u000ahold over the elements of\u000adancing did not slacken with\u000arespect to the wondrous\u000aKauthava, an emotive\u000aShabdham, or a demanding\u000aPadavarna.Pure dance sections,\u000awhich started taking shape\u000ain the jathiswara reached a\u000aclimax in the "Swamiya Karethaare"\u000a(Varna - Amrithavarshini\u000a- Githa Seetharam).\u000aShe was able to withstand\u000athe terseness of the adavus\u000awith quick reflexes and\u000apleasing agility.Deep stances and the amplitude\u000aof the described vinyasas,\u000amaintaining\u000ageometrical symmetry and\u000aprecision, exemplified the\u000aPandanallur Style, which\u000aVasundhara Doraswamy\u000ahas imprinted on her worthy\u000astudent's fertile personality.Ramayana Shabdha provided\u000amany opportunities\u000afor her to emerge with emotive\u000aexpressions."Swamiya Karethare" was\u000aa blend of melting shringara\u000aand refined stage activities.\u000aObserve how she gently arrived\u000aat moments of characterisation\u000aafter smartly\u000aexecuting every concluding\u000arhythm-cadence (theermanas),\u000awith respect to the intended\u000aadavu-series.Narasimhavatara and\u000aDroupadi Vastrapaharana\u000awere other attractive sequences\u000ain addition to a\u000aKaali Nritya and a tillana.All the artistes in the himmela\u000aheartily and competently\u000asupported the young\u000aartiste and catered to all the\u000aartistic needs of the spectators.
