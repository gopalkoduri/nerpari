VH.M. Smitha's voice is bold, resilient and adheres admirably to Shruthi even in the higher octaves, but the modulations turned coarse as it ascends those pitches. Sangitha (violin) and Radhesh (mridanga) accompanied her concert at the Ganabharathi, in Mysore. Alapanas in Mukhari ("Kshinamai" - Thyagaraja) and Lalitha ("Hiranmayim" - Dikshitar) though scholarly and fluent, expected pronounced gentleness and involvement. A neraval at the "Sangeetha Vaadya Vinodinim" (Hiranmayim Lakshimim) followed by sprightly swarakalpana culminated in a short and pleasing tani avartana. Other interesting inclusions were "Vishalakshim Vishweshwarim" (Kamavardhini - Dikshitar - with lively neraval and fluent swaraprastara at Kashirajni) and "Padavini" (Saalagabhairavi- Thyagaraja).* * *Ganesh and Kumaresh's violin\u000aduet, under the auspices of\u000aShri Subrahmanyaswamy\u000aTemple Trust, accompanied by\u000aPareppalli Phalgunan (mridanga)\u000aand Guruprasanna\u000a(kanjira), prompted observations\u000abroadly from two perspectives:\u000athe quantum of the\u000atechnique employed and the\u000aextent of the soothing moments\u000athe concert nurtured.An average listener as a\u000ameans of entertainment mainly\u000aaccommodates the first of\u000athe two; only the physical ingredients\u000aof it disappoint a serious\u000alistener, who humbly\u000aseeks the subliminal content of\u000athe music. In the present recital,\u000athe former situation had a\u000aclear edge over the latter.It was strange that the varna,\u000a"Sami Ninne Kori" (Shri -\u000aKarur Devudu Iyer) was more\u000apleasing than even the kritis, as\u000afar as the gentleness and melody\u000awere concerned, as it was\u000adevoid of any tricky special effects.There remained no doubts\u000aas to their skill in executing the\u000atechniques of bowing and fingering,\u000awhich remained untainted\u000aby any flaw,\u000airrespective of the speed. Some\u000aof the areas reached that nearness\u000ato the modulations, which\u000awas exclusive to a trained\u000avoice. Be it a portamento\u000a(bringing about variation in\u000apitch over a substantial range)\u000aor a legato (musical notes\u000aplayed smoothly) a spiccato\u000a(bow, bouncing upon the\u000astring), or marcatos (beginning\u000aof each note with a new attack),\u000athe duo were exceptional in\u000atheir dexterity and brilliance.\u000aHowever, the above repertoire\u000afell short of fostering intellectual\u000aradiance\u000aindispensable for the emanation\u000aof a serene ambience in\u000aterms of devotion or surrender,\u000aas the vaggeyakaras have\u000astrived to convey through their\u000acompositions.Thyagaraja's "Manavyala\u000aKincharadate" (Nalinakanti)\u000awas restricted to a mere speedy\u000anarration. One of the artistes\u000asang "Shri Subrhamanyaya Namasthe"\u000a(Kamboji - Dikshitar),\u000aand though it was pleasing, a\u000asection of the text did not conform\u000ato the standards a Sanskrit\u000acomposition expected,\u000abecause of wrong splitting of\u000athe words and improper stress\u000aaccents.In fact, alapana in Shanmukhapriya\u000a("Sharavanabhava" -\u000aPapanasam Sivan) gave satisfaction\u000aas long as the movements\u000awere in vilamba and\u000amadhyamakala. Swaraprastara\u000ain Ragamalika created an experience\u000aof wonder with smooth\u000aand dexterous transitions from\u000aone raga to another; yet, very\u000aquick successions did not allow\u000asufficient time to enjoy the nuances\u000aof the raga.The tani avarthana was another\u000arhythm exercise surging\u000awith full speed.
