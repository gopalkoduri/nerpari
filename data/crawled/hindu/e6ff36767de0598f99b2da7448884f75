VG. JayakumarIt should have been  longer. The freshness that E.N. Sajith, a disciple of Mangad P. Natesan, brought into his rendition during his one-hour concert left listeners yearning for more. Sajith's concert was held in connection with the `Parampara' section of the Soorya Dance and Music Festival. The concerts were a kind of musical homage to the singers' gurus.In the main composition of the evening, with an elaborate raga vistaram, Sajith rendered Ettilpuram Maharaja's `Gajavadana' in `Thodi' set to Adi talam. It was interspersed withbrighas,swara sancharasand fast -pacedkalapramanams.Perfect coordinationA noteworthy aspect of the piece was the perfect coordination of the three accompanying artistes. The thaniavarthanam that ensued with Mavelikara Rajesh on the mridangam, Karthikeyan on the ghatam, and ably supported by C.S. Anuroop on the violin was a musical feast.Unnikrishnan, noted playback singer and disciple of Dr. S. Ramanathan, beganwith a Palghat Parameswara Bhagavathar varnam, `Sarasijana' in Natta.  Unnikrishnan chose Kappi as the main raga of the evening, the kriti being Tyagaraja's `Entha soukhyamo'.Melodiously, the vocalist presented the intricacies of the raga. In the thaniavarthanam that followed V. Suresh instead of playing on the ghatam presented a kunakol, expressing the jathi orally.Unnikrishnan also rendered `Pirava varam tharum' in `Lathangi' and `Pankajaksham Ramesham' (Thodi).The following day's  concert was by Sreevalsan J. Menon, a disciple of Neyyattinkara Vasudevan. He began with a Varnam, `Eranapaii' in Thodi set to Adi talam, followed by `Lambodhara' in Kambhoji.Bringing forth the raga bhava of Bhairavi, Sreevalsan rendered `Balagopala palaya,' which was the main feature of the evening.Bottom Template Starts
