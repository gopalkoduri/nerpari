VNada Bharati featured Ranjani in a vocal concert held at its venue Swathi hall, D.D. Colony, last week. K. Rajan on violin and Srinivasan on mridangam accompanied her. Ranjani was the student of flautist N.S. Srinivasan and now takes lessons from Pantula Rama and Sita Narayanan. Though she was well placed in the IT field (she is an MCA), she got out of it and took up musica full time profession. She is gifted with a mellifluous voice with the ability to stick to a pure note.Ranjani opened her concert with Viribhoni Ata tala varnam in Bhairavi with tisram in two speeds. A slokam on Vinayaka followed. This was rendered in Hamsadhwani in Khanda rupakam. The next number she took up was Mayatheetha Swaroopini in Mayamalavagowla with a familiar swaraprasthara line. Thyagaraja's Yochana Kamalalochana in Darbaru was a pleasing rendition. Shanmukhapriya was taken up for a detailed expansion. This was an elaborate essay and her choice number in this was Siddhi Vinayakam in Rupakam of Deekshitar.Bilahari was her main item and she decorated it with plenty of sangatis. Thyagaraja's famous number Dorakuna Ituvanti was rendered by her with meaningful neraval and attractive swarakalpana. Violinist Rajan added his own flavour to the raga and swara parts in his play. Srinivasan's tani avartanam was brief and pleasing.
