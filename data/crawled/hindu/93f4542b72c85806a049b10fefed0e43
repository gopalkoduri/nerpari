VOne could see clear grounding in a rich tradition in Master Omkarnath Havaldar's recital. Trained by his father and mentor Nagaraja Rao Havaldar (renowned vocalist of Hindustani music), Omkar has inherited the traits of Kirana gharana more than the tutelage imparted by his guru. His recital was etched with emotion. The technique of presentation reached beyond his age and enthralled listeners. Starting from one of the prime ragas of Hindustani music (Marwa, "Piya More Anatha" in vilambit ektaal and tarana "Aayire shyam"), Omkar moved on to "Karuniso ranga" (Jogia ), "Akka kelavva" (Mishra Pahadi), "Ullavaru Shivalayava" (Madhuvanthi), and "Aado pogona baro Ranga" (Durga) that were sprightly and captivating. With a short and crisp Bhairavi, the artiste concluded the concert. He was accompanied by Veerabhadraiah Hiremath on harmonium and Bhima Shankar on the tabla.***Dr. R. N. Srilatha's concert from the renowned Rudrapatna tradition presented "Sarojadala netri" in raga Shankarabharana (Shyama Shastrigal) with a neraval in charana "samagana vinodini" and "Shivepahi Sri Chamudeshwari" of Mysore Vasudevacharya in raga Surati (khanda jaati aditala). She was accompanied by Veena Suresh on violin, Shivashankara Swamy on mridanga, and Anantha Krishna on the ghata.***Dr. Rajashekar Mansoor from Dharwad with Vishwanath Nakod on tabla and Fiaz Ahmed on sarangi, Ustad Rashid Khan's vocal recital from Rampur Sahaswan Gharana accompanied by Sudeer Nayak and Bharath Kamath were remarkable concerts at the Palace concerts during the recently concluded Dasara Cultural fete. Development of alap in rag Kokad by Rajshekar Mansoor and Puriya Kalyan by Ustad Rashid Khan marked with the impeccable svara-sadhana while developing the raga bhava and precision on pakad, was a wonderful treat to the audience.Ustad Rashid Khan's vilambakala pramana in rendition was a treat to connoisseurs of Hindustani music.B.S.S.
