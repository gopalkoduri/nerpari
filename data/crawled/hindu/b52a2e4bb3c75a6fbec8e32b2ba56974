VPrasanna Venkataraman, disciple of T.R.Balamani and T.K.Govinda Rao, presented a pleasing recital. &#8216;Koti Nadhulu Dhanushkoti&#8217; in Thodi and &#8216;Thulasi Bilva Mallika&#8217; in Kedaragowla (both by Tyagaraja) won wide applause for the delineation of the ragas, niraval and swarakalpanas. His melodious voice and controlled presentation indicate a bright future.Sandeep Narayanan, disciple of Sanjay Subramaniam  delved deep into Bhairavi and sang an elaborate &#8216;Yaaro Ivar Yaaro&#8217;   bringing out the nuances of the raga and the beauty of Arunachala Kavirayar&#8217;s lyric.  He resembled his guru in  raga delineation and  rendition of  kritis   and will hopefully  evolve a style of his own.  He was equally good at rendering both heavy and lighter kritis.Another artiste who showed a strong resemblance to her guru was Krithika Anand (guru - Bombay Jayashri Ramnath). She elaborated Kalyani and rendered &#8216;Bhajare, Re Chitha&#8217; by Dikshitar. She will do well with more practice. Her lighter pieces, however, were  enjoyable, particularly the ragamalika, &#8216;Paayum Oli Nee Enakku&#8217; by Bharatiar. Her clarity of diction and emotion-filled presentation  won her admiration.The confident way in which Ramakrishnan Murthy, disciple of C.R.Vaidhyanathan and Delhi P.Sundararajan, carried himself, impressed the  audience.  His   mature way of handling  the ragas and swaras won great acclaim.Kovai  C.V. Kannan and D. Sathyaprakash, disciples of Pandanallur P.Chandrasekara Bhagavatar,  successfully delineated the ragas  Bhavapriya (Srikantha Nee Yeda - Tyagaraja) and Kosalam (Kaa Guha Shanmuga - Koteswara Iyer).  They were at home while singing the viruttam, &#8216;Manadhu Thuyar Ara&#8217;.  The songs, &#8216;Vaa Kalaabha Mayil Mel&#8217; (Sallabham-Sudhananda Bharati) and &#8216;Pazhamo, Pazhamo Pazham&#8217; (Gowri Manohari - Oothukadu Venkata Subbaiyer) were pleasing.Manimaran&#8217;s (disciple of Late Kuzhikkarai Viswalingam) over-all performance was  good but he could have made the concert impressive by infusing more energy  into his music.
