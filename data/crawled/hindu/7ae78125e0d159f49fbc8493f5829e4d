VPrema Rangarajan  presented a remarkable pack of rare  compositions of  well-known composers for the October Music Fest of SAFE at Sastri Hall.  The opening itself made a difference with &#8216;Sakalakala vani&#8217; a varnam in Hindolam, followed by &#8216;Pahimam Sri Rajarajeswari&#8217; (Nattai) of Syama Sastri with swaras at &#8216;Syama Krishna sodari.&#8217;The sketchy essay of Kalyani was a prelude to  &#8216;Sri Madurambike&#8217; of Dikshitar and Prema embellished it with an expansion at &#8216;Somasundareswara hrudaya&#8217; with swaras. A rather tepid and desolate Suddha Saveri (Devakriya in Dikshitar&#8217;s school) came with &#8216;Sandhya devim savitrim.&#8217; Here too there was a swara adjunct at &#8216;Sapthaswara matruka roopinim.&#8217; &#8216;Sri Janaka Thanaye&#8217; in Kalakandi (a derivative of 13 melakarta Gayakapriya) of Tyagaraja was added to the kitty.Notwithstanding all these fresh items, the concert picked up a tempo only with Prema&#8217;s elucidation of Urmika, (Simhendramadyamam sans dhaivatam). It was not the popular &#8216;Entani vina&#8217;  but a composition of Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavatar &#8216;Kala rathri swaroopini.&#8217; Rangarajan&#8217;s Urmika expanse exhibited her knowledge and resourcefulness in proper mix. The niraval at &#8216;Kali kalanki kapalini soolini&#8217; and the swaras attached showed distinction.  Her vocal chords suffered from minor glitches occasionally and there was a visible strain in rendition.Bhairavi was crafted with a surfeit of brisk rolling akaras and  a few extended kaarvais. The  finer shades of  the raga emerged in the  rendition of &#8216;Sri Lalithe Kanchi Nagara Nivasini&#8217; (Annaswami Sastry). &#8216;Neelothpala dala lochane&#8217; was taken up for a brief niraval, amply compensated by  a complex swarakalpana pitching on the kuraippu with &#8216;panchamam.&#8217;Amrutha Murali on the violin  reflected the vocalist in all her replies, especially good in her essay of  Urmika and Bhairavi. J. Balaji on the mridangam was  satisfactory.Power cut plunged  Sastri Hall  into  darkness but  Seetha Naryanan and her team &#8212;  Usha Rajagopalan and Trivandrum Vaidyanathan &#8212; illuminated the hall with their inspiring presentation of Charukesi. The  main item of the concert was Kalyani  but Seetha Narayanan&#8217;s intense  treatise of Charukesi followed by &#8216;Krupaya palaya sowre&#8217; of Swati Tirunal with spotlight at &#8216;Narada muka muni nikaregeya charita&#8217; brought out the best of the singer, her vision and experience.Be it raga alapana. niraval or swaras they conformed to the gradual, methodical development without a trace of  haste or pomposity. Her phrasings in raga expositions were controlled and swara combines were candid yet appealing with agreeable complexity. One could realise this in her  meticulous delivery of the innumerable sangatis of the famous kriti &#8216;Ethavunara&#8217; (Kalyani).Usha Rajagopalan made her best contribution in Charukesi and Kalyani, matching the vocalist in  sensitivity.  Trivandraum Vaidyanathan&#8217;s percussion had   fine touches.  &#8216;Gana nathane&#8217; in Saranga and &#8216;Kamakshi kamakoti&#8217; in Sumadythi were noteworthy items in Seetha&#8217;s agenda.Padma Chandilyan chose to dwell at length  on Simhendramadyamam and Bhairavi.  Padma&#8217;s voice maintained its range and sweetness. But there were some rough edges that the trained ear could detect now and then.  The Simhendramadyamam suit was developed in a significant manner yet the grip was missing and the phrases were weakly linked. &#8216;Ninne nammidi nayya&#8217; of Vasudevachar moved on the right track with a sincere niraval part at &#8216;Pannekendra sayana&#8217; with swaras.Bhairavi was better  with a number of usual and novel passages. The leisurely pace of Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Bala gopala&#8217;  was a contrast to the bouncy and full fledged niraval at &#8216;Neela neerada sareera.&#8217; The kalpanaswara fare set on pachamam as focal note carried the desired verve.&#8216;Gajavadana beduve&#8217; of Purandaradasa that is sung normally in Hamsadwani was tuned in Dhanyasi by Padma. &#8216;Ekkalathilum maraven&#8217; (Natakurinji, Ramaswami Sivan), &#8216;Janakiramana&#8217; (Kapi, Vanamamalai Jeer), &#8216;Sri Sankara Guruvaram&#8217; (Nagaswarali, Maha Vaidyanatha Iyer), &#8216;Kshemam guru gopala&#8217; (Mohanam, Ambujam Krishna) found appropriate slots in Padma Chandilyan&#8217;s concert.Kalyani Sankar was more careful at the same time quite enthusiastic in her responses to the vocalist. But for a few hasty segments, Kalyani enlightened the listeners with her neat presentations of  ragas, niraval and swaras. A.S. Ranganathan&#8217;s percussion was a cool support with a brief, but exciting tani avarthanam.
