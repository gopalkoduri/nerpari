VS.SIVAKUMARCarnatic music affords a flexible canvas. Once the grammar is grasped and internalised, creativity can have a good time within prescribed limits. Tiruchi Pradeep Kumar seems to belong to the category of those that are young and yet treat art with awe and responsibility and can create without going astray. His concert was held at Tattvaloka auditorium, organised by Carnatica.Com in association withSruthimagazine.Sri raga Varnam, as a beginning, was sung to show how well Pradeep had captured the bhava and raga swaroopa adequately. Begada (`Sankari Neeve' - Subbaraya Sastri ) alapana was again distinct with phrases both customary and fresh.Special alapana`Bagayyanayya' (Chandra Jothi-Tyagaraja) had kalpanaswaras flowing with élan, but then it was the special alapana of Panthuvarali (`Ramanatha Bhajeham'-Dikshitar) that could well proclaim Pradeep Kumar's original conception of the raga and brimmed with creativity. `Vaidehi Sahitham,' a slokam, came as a prelude to `Pibare Ramarasam'.Satish on the violin was a good foil to the main artiste and played a sweet Panthuvarali in his own style. Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar on the mridangam put himself and the main artiste at complete comfort both during regular accompaniment and the brief thani.One word of caution to young Pradeep. The Chittaiswaram for `Sankari Neeve' should be held sacrosanct. Stretching and shortening of swaras on the plea of either embellishment or expression of imagination would needlessly disturb the original.Bottom Template Starts
