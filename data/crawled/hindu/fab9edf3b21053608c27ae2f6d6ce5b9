VA Centennial RetrospectiveG.N. Balasubramanian (Vintage recordings from the 1930s, 40s and 50s)Srishti&#8217;s Carnatica P LtdMRP Rs. 249.Even as G.N. Balasubramanian&#8217;s birth centenary is being celebrated by various organisations this year, Shristi&#8217;s Carnatica P Ltd has released this double-CD album to mark the occasion. A mix of recordings from 78 RPMs and live concerts fe\u000aature in this album as also classic duets from films, sung with M.S. Subbulakshmi.That Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar was GNB&#8217;s maanasika guru is evident while listening to the first song. The Thodi alapana followed by the kriti &#8216;Amba Naadu&#8217; and the brief kalpanaswaras bear  a striking resemblance to the singing style of Ariyakudi. The youthful exuberance is in full display in GNB&#8217;s vocalisation of the sloka &#8216;Saayankale&#8217; (Kedaragowla, Kanada and Kaapi ) followed by the kritis &#8216;Dharini (Suddhasaveri), &#8216;Sri Subramanyaya&#8217; (Khambodi), &#8216;Parasakthi&#8217; (Saveri ) and &#8216;O Jagadamba&#8217; (Anandabhairavi). These songs are from his 78 RPM discs cut in the 1930s and 1940s.The two duets from &#8216;Sakunthalai&#8217; with MS include  &#8216;Mamamohananga&#8217; and &#8216;Premayil&#8217;. The first disc also contains songs popularised by GNB such as &#8216;Nallasakunam&#8217; (Shanmukhapriya), &#8216;Karunalaya&#8217; (Hindolam), &#8216;Kannanai Kaanbadeppo&#8217; (ragamalika), &#8216;Kannane En Kanavan&#8217; (Kalyani), &#8216;Jayati Jayati&#8217; (Khamas) and &#8216;Dhavala Roopa Saraswathi&#8217; (Anandabhairavi). The inlay card mentions the composer of &#8216;Jayati Jayati&#8217; as Bharatiar. But it is a creation of Mayuram Viswanatha Sastri.The magnificence of GNB&#8217;s voice is showcased in the excerpts from his live concerts in the 1950s. &#8216;Raama Ninne&#8217; (Saranga), &#8216;Brovavamma&#8217; (Maanji) and &#8216;Ethavuna&#8217; (Yadukula Khambodi) are delightful versions.The crowning piece in this disc is a brilliant exposition of Devamanohari sung as a prelude to the pallavi in adi tala (single kalai) commencing after three aksharas from samam. The kalpanaswaras in ragamalika feature Purvikalyani, Natabhairavi, Kalyani, Anandabhairavi and Gowrimanohari. These are sung with a punch and engage one&#8217;s attention.The album comes to a close with the Surutti kriti attributed to Tyagaraja &#8216;Paramukhamelara&#8217;. The vocalist invests a lot of bhava into the singing of this kriti.  The solfa passages reflect the genius of the master. One cannot but marvel at the swara replies on the violin by Lalgudi Jayaraman for the Surutti song, which earns him repeated appreciation from the vocalist.
