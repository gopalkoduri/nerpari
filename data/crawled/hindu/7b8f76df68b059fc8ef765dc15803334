VSri Karthikeya Gaana Sabha completed its first year successfully by conducting regular monthly concerts and their final concert took place at Sri Gyana Saraswathi temple at Padma Rao Nagar Colony, featuring veena trio Syamala sisters from Hyderabad.Bandi Syamala who is the eldest of the three sisters, is an A-grade artiste of AIR. The Trio's, Syamala Balasubramanyam, Subbalakshmi and Satyamani, style of playing is basically traditional and mostly gayaki in nature. They began their concert with Sree Raga Varnam Sami Ninne kori in adi with good synchronization. Sree Saraswathi in Arabhi was aptly chosen as the concert was held at a Sarasawathi temple.Khamas was briefly hummed by Satyamani who is the youngest sister Seethapathbi namanasuna with good feel. Dwijavanthi was taken for Akhilandeswari of Deekshitar and the rendition was played in unison with good expression. Bhairavi was taken for main expansion of the day. Syamala was in full control of the ragam with madhyamakalam tanam. The raga bhavam was well intact through her alap.Srinivas on the mridangam led the concert from the front with his good anticipation and soothing following.The hall acoustics was not up to the mark as the audio levels were quite poor. The trio did their best to maintain the tempo.
