VPoetry constitutes the highest form of aesthetic enjoyment. Poetry, even when not set to music, has a lilt to it. The Vedas, for example, have a melodic structure. Sarngadeva says the Sama Vedam is sweet music &#8212; &#8220;Sama vedam idham Sangeetham.&#8221; Whether in Sanskrit or in regional traditions, verses have been used to express music.The Tamil traditions of Thevaram and Divya Prabandham are to some extent unbroken, living traditions. Suddhangam and layangam are seen in these verses. Periyazhwar&#8217;s verses like &#8220;Maanikkam katti&#8221; are the forerunners of the Pillai Tamizh verses of later years.Tamil poetry has a structure called &#8220;Naaladi mel eeradi vaippu,&#8221; which Tirunavukkarasar uses in his &#8220;Maadar pirai kanniyaanai.&#8221; This verse is in the pann Gandharam. In Arunagirinathar&#8217;s Tiruppugazh, the panns are not mentioned. However, some Tiruppugazh hymns have been traditionally sung in the same raga. For example, &#8220;Iyal isai nuchitha vanji&#8221; has traditionally been sung in Husseni.All these devotional verses have an inbuilt musicality.Jayadeva&#8217;s Ashtapadi has influenced sopana paddhati in Kerala. In Odissi, the Dasavatara slokam in Geetha Govindam is sung in Miyanki Todi. Appayya Dikshitar&#8217;s sloka &#8220;Vara veena mrudu paani&#8221; became a geetham in Mohana raga. In Annamayya&#8217;s compositions we see varieties of prasa (rhyme).As far as these devotional lyrics were concerned, music served as a medium for the words. In later years, when classical music came into its own, the verses became vehicles to carry the music.It was at this time that blank verse came into existence. But all the facets of prosody such as yati, prasa and rasa were retained in blank verse too.In Tyagaraja kritis, &#8216;Nannu palimpa,&#8217; for example, we see anu prasa. In his &#8216;Nouka Charitram&#8217; he has used Telugu poetic forms such as seesa padyam and kanda padyam. In Telugu wedding songs seesa padyam is set in Ananda Bhairavi. Kanda padyam is set in Kedaragowla.Syama Sastri uses repetitions to impart a poetic quality to his kritis. In &#8216;Durusuga kripa&#8217; (Saveri), the words &#8220;salupu nanu&#8221; are repeated three times. Such repetitions are also seen in his &#8220;Enneramum&#8221; (Punnagavarali), and in Mayamma (Ahiri).To write poetry requires mastery of the language. That is why Patnam Subramania Iyer and Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar composed in Telugu. That was the language in which they had scholarship. Although it is said that Telugu was probably the preferred language for musical compositions because it is a vowel-rich language, those who composed in Telugu did so because they could compose with felicity in Telugu. Gopalakrishna Bharati composed in Tamil, because of his knowledge of Tamil.Durga sang a drupad of the 16th century composer Baiju Bawra to show the poetical quality of drupads.During the time of Ariyakkudi and Maharajapuram, slokas began to be sung towards the end of the concert after the pallavi, either as ragamalikas or in a single raga. M.S. would often sing a sloka and then follow it up with a kriti. What is the place of devotional verses in today&#8217;s concerts? These days some vidwans sing slokas in the beginning of concerts. Others conclude with &#8220;Mangalam Kosalendraaya.&#8221; A creative person can well sing devotional pieces for 30 minutes in a kutcheri. Poetry and music are inseparable, each enhancing the beauty of the other, Durga concluded.
