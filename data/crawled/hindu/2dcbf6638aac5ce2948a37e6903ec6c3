VSri Satguru Sangeeta Samajam began its 57th anniversary celebrations on January 3, with a prayer song by prize winners of the music competition, M. Chamundeshwari and R. Krishnabharathi.The inaugural concert by Sudha Ragunathan, who was conferred the title, &#8216;Madhurakala Praveena,&#8217; that evening began auspiciously with Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam&#8217; in Shanmukhapriya. Sudha invoked the blessings of &#8216;Balagopala&#8217; (Dikshitar) through a long drawn alapana in Bhairavi. &#8216;Evarito&#8217;  in Manavathi, the Tyagaraja kriti, popularised by her guru MLV, was followed by other endearing favourites such as Gopala Krishna Bharathi&#8217;s &#8216;Ananda Natamaduvar&#8217; in Purvi Kalyani and Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Akilandeshwari&#8217; in Dwijavanti. M.R. Gopinath on the violin, Palladam Ravi on the mridangam and R. Raman on the morsing provided orchestral support.Gayatri Girish, on the second day, brought out the inbuilt rhythm in  &#8216;Swagatham Krishna&#8217; that followed the soothing strains of &#8216;Nadasudha Rasa&#8217; (Tyagaraja) in Arabhi. The chords of Akkarai Subbulakshmi&#8217;s violin blended well with Gayatri&#8217;s vocal chords, to produce excellent alapanas in Purvi Kalyani and Khambodi. Palladam Ravi and Adambakkam K. Shankar made creative contributions on the mridangam and ghatam respectively. The tukkadas were exclusively on Lord Krishna, including &#8216;Kakkai Chiraginile,&#8217; &#8216;Katrinile Varum Geetam&#8217; and &#8216;Kunidadi Krishna.&#8217;The Mambalam sisters, Vijayalakshmi and Chitra, brought the audience under the spell of Shankarabharanam in their prelude to Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Enduku Pedhala.&#8217; Their short alapanas in Ritigowla and Bhowli were samples of the sweetness of the ragas. Vijayalakshmi took the lead and sang a few phrases in Varali to begin Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Maamava Meenakshi,&#8217; while Chitra displayed her virtuosity in singing the viruttam, &#8216;Nalam Tharum.&#8217; Nellai A. Balaji on the mridangam proved adept at matching a variety of jatis to the phrases sung, while K.S. Rangachari on the ganjira played totally in tune with the former.The violin duet by Ganesh and Kumaresh began with an energetic rendering of the Sahana varnam, &#8216;Karunimpa&#8217; in all the three speeds, followed by  popular kritis &#8216;Teliyaledhu Rama&#8217; in Denuka and &#8216;Thaye Yasodha&#8217; in Kapi.The violinists explained their attempts  in composing a piece titled, &#8216;Raga Pravaha,&#8217; in Jana Ranjani, a melody without lyrics, in which the duo played different notes at the same time.This was akin to the concept of &#8216;thribhinna&#8217; in traditional music.The swarapravaha in the Ragam, Tanam and Pallavi was fast and rhythmic.Parapalli Phalgun on the mridangam and Tiruchi S. Krishna on the ghatam, who were observers during the melodic sessions, made up with exuberant gusto during the thani and won a round of applause.The final presentation was a seamless blending of Krishna favourites such as &#8216;Radha Sameta,&#8217; &#8216;Krishna Nee Begane&#8217; and &#8216;Jagadodharana.&#8217;The confident and engaging presentation of the sisters, Ranjani and Gayatri  included Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Tatvamariya&#8217; in Ritigowla, Andal&#8217;s &#8216;Thoomani Madathu&#8217; in Hamir Kalyani and &#8216;Maamava Meenakshi&#8217; in Varali. The sisters&#8217; interpretation of Hamsanandhi in the Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi was different and unique and stood testimony to their effort and practice. Charumathi Raguraman on the violin adapted very well to the individual style of the singers and Manoj Siva on the mridangam and V. Anirudh Athreya on the ganjira provided fine support.The pleasing notes of Khamas reverberated through the halls, as T. M. Krishna began his recital with &#8216;Sujana Jeevana.&#8217; He then sang, &#8216;Ka Va Va&#8217; in Varali in his forceful distinct style.The kalpanaswaras in Narayana Gowlai were sung with spontaneous felicity, and the notes seemed to rush to the beck and call of the singer.&#8216;Ninne Nammiti&#8217; in Sneha Manjari was sung in response to the audience request for something new. The violinist who pitted his skills against such variety was B.U. Ganesh Prasad and he did fairly well. The exchange between Poongulam Subramanyam on the mridangam and N. Guruprasad on the ghatam was a well played contest.Sanjay Subrahmaniam sang with his usual playful energy, his selections including Koteeswara Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;Kalangadhiru Maname&#8217; in Ragavardhani, Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Siva Siva Ena Rada&#8217; in Kamavardhani and Dhandapani Desikar&#8217;s &#8216;Adiyenai Kaatharulvai.&#8217; He created a world of wordless expression in his grand alapana in Sivaranjani, in his Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi, the Pallavi being the simple, first lines of &#8216;Parukkulle.&#8217; Catchy Tamil songs such as &#8216;Kanda Guha&#8217; and &#8216;Narayananai&#8217; sung at the end of the concert were appreciated by the audience.The success of the first half of the festival augurs well for the rest of the concerts that are to follow.
