The event began with the awarding of the title `Nadachandrika' to Subhashini Vijayan.Later in the evening, the audience were treated to a melodious vocal concert by Sandhya Ramanadhan. A well-known violinist, Sandhya is an accomplished singer too.Her mellifluous voice and holistic approach to raga-bhava-laya and  perfect sruthi alignment had therasikasin raptures.Sandhya started her recital with `Eranapai,' an Adi tala varnam of Pattanam Subrahmanya Iyer in Thodi. A brilliant swaraprasthara was rendered in Tyagaraja's `Ninne Bhajana' in raga Natta.Swati Tirunal's devotional song `Rama Rama Pahi' was followed by a brisk composition by Swati  -   `Paramapurusham' in Lalithapanchamam, set to Khandha chappu.Excellent kalpanaswara`Saranam bhava karunamayim,' a tharangam composed by Narayanatheerthar in Hamsavinodini, Roopaka tala, paved the way to a rendition of the demanding raga Ramapriya, bringing to fore its different swaroopas. `Korinavara Musaguvayya Kodanda Panee' of Pattanam Subrahmanya Iyer, set to Roopaka tala was adorned with artistic niraval and excellent kalpanaswara at `Sarivari.'After the Tyagaraja kriti `Nee dayarada' in Vasantha bhairavi came an exhaustive ragalapana of Keeravani.  Gopalakrishna Bharathy's `Innamum santhehappetalamo' was embellished with cascading manodharmaswara in two speeds.Sandhya's voice easily traversed the upper octaves. Anoop Bhaskaran, who accompanied on the violin, rendered able support. Kallekulangara Unnikrishnan, with his exemplary tekas and controlled beat, lent the concert charm.A contemplative rendition of `Balakrishnadevam' in Yamunakalyani, `Viharamanasarame' in Kapi and `Siva Siva Siva Bho' of Jayachamarendravadiyar were some of the other compositions sung.The concert wound up with `Pathikki Harathy' in Surutty, an Uthsava Sampradaya kirti of Tyagaraja.Students who did well in the classical music examinations conducted by Akhila Bharatha Gandharva Maha Vidyalaya Mandal, Mumbai, and the prize winners in vocal and instrumental music of the inter-zone competitions for 2006-2007 were also felicitated.Bottom Template Starts
