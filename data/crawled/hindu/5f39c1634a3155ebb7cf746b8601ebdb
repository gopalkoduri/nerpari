VC. S. Sajeev sings seven songs of Swati Tirunal, the prince among musicians and a musician among princes. His accompanists are Neela Jayakumar (violin), J. Balaji (mridangam) and Adambakkam Shankar (ghatam). The programme is off to a brisk start with `Jaya Jaya Padmanabha' in Manirangu with swaraprastharas.The not often heard `Pankajakshanari' with neraval and swaras showcase the singer's systematic bani. Mohana Kalyani is a charmer all the way, and `Seve Sri Kantham' is a pleasing rendition. The brief mukhari alapana begins with a hit and go approach, but `Bhavathi Viswaso" is a calm, collected interpretation quite in keeping with the basic swaroopa of the raga. `Gopa Nandana' in Bhushavali is a felicitous effort, while the Suddha Saveri delineation is acceptable in terms of listening interest and raga lakshana. `Janani Pahi,' one of the Navaratri songs of Swati Tirunal is sung after tanam, normally associated only with the Ragam, Tanam, Pallavi segment.The violinist is impressive in her tanam display. After a short percussion interlude, `Bhujaga Sayana' in caressing Yadhukula Kambhoji brings the curtain down on a satisfactory programme.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
