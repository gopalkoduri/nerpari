VThe Malleswaram Sangeetha Sabha, Bangalore, presented the Hanuma Jayanthi Young Musicians Music Festival last week, in association with Ananya GML Cultural Academy and the Directorate of Kannada and Culture, Government of Karnataka. The Festival, spread over four days, featured talented young artistes in three concerts of Carnatic Music and one of Hindustani Music (devotional).Ranjini Nagaraj, who gave a vocal recital on the concluding day of the Festival, was accompanied by U.N. Niranjan (violin), B.S. Prashanth (mridanga) and R. Karthik (khanjira). She began with &#8220;Amma Anandadayini&#8221; a varna in Gambhiranatta raga and aditala composed by M. Balamuralikrishna. Dikshithar's &#8220;Mahaganapathim Manasa Smarami&#8221; in Natta was suffixed with fluent kalpana swaras at &#8220;Mahakavya Natakadipriyam&#8221;, and was followed by a brief sketch of Yadukula Kamboji and the Navagraha krithi &#8220;Divakara Thanujam Shanaishcharam&#8221;, appropriate for a Saturday concert. Sreeranjini was next taken up for an alapana that incorporated a number of sancharas around key swaras such as the madhyama and dhaivatha, that were at once melodious and intricate, attesting to abundant improvisational powers and a flexible voice augmented by sound training. &#8220;Sogasuga Mridanga Thalamu&#8221;, the Thyagaraja composition in rupaka thala, was supplemented with an engaging neraval that included the entire sahithya from &#8220;Navarasa Yutha Krithiche&#8221; and kalpana swaras that exhibited firm control over laya.M. Balamuralikrishna's &#8220;Hanuma&#8221; in Sarasangi raga and adi thala, was notable for its arresting emphasis on the madhyama in different octaves, effectively highlighted in the current rendition. The elaboration of Kalyani, the main raga of the evening, sought to illumine its exotic shades through a plethora of spiralling bhriga oriented sancharas, rather than to accent its alluring traditional image through a gamaka-oriented approach. The Thyagaraja krithi in mishra chapu thala, &#8220;Nidhi Chala Sukhama&#8221; was rendered with a neraval at &#8220;Mamatha Bandhanayutha&#8221;, and kalpana swaras that incorporated a series of challenging shruthi bheda exercises launched from different notes. Overall, greater clarity in the articulation of lyrics and more reposeful raga alapanas would have enhanced the impact of the gifted young vocalist's renderings. The concert, which was reinforced by commendable accompaniment by the violinist and skilled support from the percussionists, concluded with &#8220;Hanumatha Mathave&#8221; in Tilang and a tillana in Bageshri composed by Nagavalli Nagaraj.The other artistes who participated in the Festival were Lavanya Krishnamurthy accompanied by B.R. Ramya (violin), Soorali Balakrishna (mridanga), and B.S. Raghunandan (ghata), Venkatesh Alkod and party (Hindustani devotional), and Vivek Sadashivam accompanied by V. Kowshik (violin), V. Karthik (mridanga) and M.R. Purushotham (ghata).
