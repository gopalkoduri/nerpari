VWith the demise of C. Ashwath, a major chapter in Sugama Sangeeta has come to an end. The form that has a short history of perhaps 75 years, has seen rich variety -- extraordinary composers and gifted singers. Like other light forms in music, Sugama Sangeeta also came under the influence of many other genres and each composer had his own distinct blend. Not many musicians have been spared by the charm of Sugama Sangeeta, even the veterans. Bhimsen Joshi, Krishna Hangal, Amirbai Karnataki, Jayavantidevi Hirebet were among the early songbirds. To bring these varied strains &#8211; of composers and songsters -- together on one single stage is quite a feat. M.D. Pallavi one of the most talented singers of these times, offered a tribute &#8220;Swara Smarane&#8221;, an evening of memorable songs to all those composers who made Kannada lyric music unforgettable, in Bangalore recently. What is truly remarkable is that she dared such a feat.This unusual concert which marked the launch of Samudra Trust, was remarkable roping in over 30-odd musicians who performed live. A live orchestra is not easy to pull off &#8211; considering that it involves extended rehearsals. A complete violin section, percussion and keyboard section, apart from guitar, flute, electronic piano, accordion, saxophone and bass guitar (none less than Keith Peters), it was sheer grandeur. Praveen D. Rao extremely proficient in the way he conducted the orchestra and the chorus, added to the overall impact of this special evening.Pallavi began with the prayerful &#8220;Udayavaagali Namma Cheluva Kannada Naadu&#8221; composed by the pioneer of Sugama Sangeeta, P. Kalinga Rao. Padmacharan's &#8220;Udugana Veshtita&#8221; in Kalyani was mellifluous. It probably takes a composer like Mysore Ananthaswamy to tune a poem like &#8220;Naaku Tanti&#8221; and how fascinatingly different his &#8220;Bhoomi Tabbid Modiddhange&#8221; was! Pallavi sparkled in her rendition of both these songs. The chorus for Rajaratnam's &#8220;Bhoomi&#8230;&#8221; was outstanding and Rainer Pusch on the saxophone rendered the lilting, romantic song with an altogether new feel. Listening to H.K. Narayana's song &#8220;Danida jeevake matte kanasunisi&#8221; transported one back to the radio era of unsullied, subtle sounds. What made the song exceptional was that it had been rendered by Mysore Ananthaswamy whose musical idiom was so very different from H.K. Narayana. Pallavi chose to dedicate the evening to the late Raju Ananthaswamy and C. Ashwath. In her rendition of &#8220;Sorutihudu Maneya&#8230;&#8221;, an Ashwath composition, one could sense the energy of this maverick genius.What gave the concert an edge was the fact that Pallavi gave a brief introduction to each of these composers and their styles. It not only placed them in their context, but also gave a glimpse of their musical inclinations. This concert will be remembered for a long time to come.
