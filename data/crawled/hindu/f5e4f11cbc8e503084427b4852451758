VIn an altruistic attempt to enliven the music scene in second tier cities, Ragalaya Trust, Chennai, with Sri Satguru Sangeeta Samajam and Airtel, jointly presented the Navaratri Music Festival in Madurai.On the opening day, Priya sisters, Haripriya and Shanmugapriya , who began with the ata tala Mohanam varnam, &#8216;Sarasijaksha&#8217;, went on to sing a soul-satisfying &#8216;Gana Nadane&#8217; in Saranga, brightening it with short strings of kalpanaswaras, and then cruised through a melodious &#8216;Ma Padavelasi&#8217; in Ravichandrika to the soothing accompaniment of V.V.Srivasa Rao&#8217;s violin.The novelty of the alapana in Gamanashrama to the song, &#8216;Igame Sugam Tharum&#8221; was alluring and refreshing. Tyagaraja&#8217;s adoration of the Lord, &#8216;Enta Mudho&#8217; in Bindu Malini was rendered well. The alapana in Bhairavi to Syama Sastry&#8217;s &#8216;Sari Evaramma&#8217; was an unhurried and consummate exploration of the raga.&#8216;Energy begets energy&#8217; goes the saying. Every single member of the audience warmed up and responded to the vivacious energy of the Malladi brothers with smiles, nods and applause. Not only did they mention the names of ragas such as Palahamsa and Snehavati, but also sang the arohanam and avarohanam of the same in order to make the audience understand the nuances of the raga. Singing with effort and involvement, the brothers Sriram Kumar and Ravikumar tendered a fine blend of emotion, rhythm and imagination. Their alapanas were not mere explorations of the raga, but an exposition of their ability to compose. Tanjore Krishnaswamy Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;Amba Paradevate&#8217; in Rudrapriya was one of the fast paced presentations while the pallavi of &#8216;Sri Raguvaraprameya&#8217; in Kamboji was soul stirring. Thiruvarur Bhaktavatsalam on the mridangam did justice to the expectations of his fans by producing delightful variations in the tani avartanam and Bangalore Amrit used his skill on the kanjira to produce surprising combinations with gusto.&#8216;The Divine Ensemble&#8217;, as the last day&#8217;s programme was titled, comprised an orchestra of Bangalore Lakshmanan on the nagaswaram, Thiruvarur Swaminathan on the flute, Thiruvarur Bakthavatsalam on the mridangam, V.Suresh on the ghatam, Anirudh on the kanjira, Paiyannur Govindaprasad on the morsing and Chennai Venkata Subramaniyam on the tabla. The concert began on an auspicious note with Lakshmanan playing the mallari, soon to be accompanied by the flutist, with the percussionists choosing their time to join in and enhance the effect. One of the two instrumentalists took turns to take the lead while the other played the role of the accompanist. It was a balancing act for them to match the tones of the flute and the nagaswaram. Thiruvarur Bhakthavatsam used his knowledge of lyrics to play matching phrases on the mridngam.The Pancharatna kriti, &#8216;Entaro Mahanubhavulu&#8217; began not with a short alapana as one would expect, but with a few jathis played on the mridangam. Lakshmanan&#8217;s &#8216;Samajavaragamana&#8217; in Hindolam was pleasing to the ear. Instances of raga exploration were few and the playing was rhythmic rather than melodic. On the whole, the orchestration was a novel attempt in a field where the performers are normally soloists.
