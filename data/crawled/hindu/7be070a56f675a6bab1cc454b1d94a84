VYella Venkateswara Rao is one of a few frontline men in the field of percussion, from Andhra Pradesh, for which he was also bestowed with the Padma Shri award. He took a step forward with the aim of giving mridangam a central role in musical ensemble. He created a number of themes suitable to his art, playing new rhythmic compositions to entertain the audience, calling them by different names, like Navamridanga Vinyasam and so on. He was known for presenting &#8216;Siva Thandavam' with rhythmic syllables in All India Radio too. He also attempted to play kirtanas of simple structure tuning the mridangas to different notes of the raga. Now the latest theme he came out with was called &#8216;Mridanga Thandavam'. He intended it for Sivaratri. Yuvakala Vauhini, a cultural organisation, arranged this programme at Ravindra Bharati.But this programme was not a solo presentation of &#8216;Mridanga Thandavam'. It took the shape of fusion with almost a dozen instruments coming into play. This time the menu was restricted to pay obeisance to Lord Siva by opening the show with a prayer to Vinayaka &#8211; Vatapi Gnapatim Bhaje in Hamsadhwani and couple of other numbers. Venkateswara Rao was accompanied by Tharun on guitar, Ganesh on keyboard, Thyagaraju on violin, Prem on pads, Uma Padmaja on veena, Srikanth on tabla, Venkatesh on flute, Yella's two grandsons one on ghatam and another on pads. Dhanunjay, from Vijayanagaram, was the vocalist.Lot of time was consumed adjusting the sound for all the instruments. But the result was lack of compatibility in sounds, electronic drums and pads ruling the roost drowning the vocalist's output. The whole programme was a bit loud. In the very opening Vatapi in Hamsadhawni, the vocalist faltered in both Shruti and rhythm fell a bit behind. Yella was seen often guiding the sound controller before him in the pit, to strike balance. The fundamental rule of a fusion group is perfection and never to look back. Violin by Thyagaraju was the saving grace.Yella on his mridangam simply dominated the proceedings. Life in the fusion returned only in second number, purely an instrumental presentation in Hindustani raga Jog. It gave a wonderful feel with Ganesh's intermittent keyboard play. Prem on pads too excelled. Yella provided rhythmic graces, sometimes joining his voice with konukkolu, verbal rhythmic syllables. The final number was the much popular Brahma Murare Surarchita lingam song had traces of Pantuvarali but slowly merged into Revati in the final part. Yella informed that he was scoring the rhythm symbolic of &#8216;Urdhva Tandavam' of Lord Siva adapting to &#8216;Gopuchayati' technic of reducing the beats to halves from 12 to a single beat. The extended final part was the essence of the concept of the whole programme of &#8216;Mridanga Thandavam'.
