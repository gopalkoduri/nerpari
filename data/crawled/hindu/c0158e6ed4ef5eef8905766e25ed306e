VTrained under the Dhanammal music tradition, Rama Ravi was full of ebullience keeping up the thrust from the start with the Saranga varnam, &#8216;Inthamodi,&#8217; in her vocal recital on the second day of the September season of music and dance in Rajalakshmi Fine Arts, Coimbatore. In the following &#8216;Sri Kanchinayike&#8217; (Asaveri) and &#8216;Sivakameswareem&#8217; (Nattakurinji), she imparted delicacy in the articulation of the sahitya and depth in bringing out the structure of the kriti. Her raga delineations of Begada for the kriti, &#8216;Nee Vere Kuladanamu&#8217; and Subhapantuvarali for &#8216;Paripahimaam&#8217; with majestic pidis unearthed rare nuggets. Her portrayal of Mohanam carried fresh perspectives in the tarasthayi that added sheen to the raga for the kriti, &#8216;Jagadeeswari Kripai Puri&#8217; garnished with swaras.The piece-de-resistance of the concert was &#8216;Raksha Betteve&#8217; in Bhairavi in which the artist crafted the sancharas in deliberately chosen idiom conferring a rare breath of freshness. The fingering prowess of Basker on the violin evident in the solo versions of the ragas and swara repartees was classic in quality. The elegance and refinement of the beats on the mridangam from Ganapathiraman and ganjira from Gopalakrishnan enveloped the concert in a melodic garb.
