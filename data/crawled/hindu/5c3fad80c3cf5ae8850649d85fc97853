VK.J. Yesudas touched the right chord. Among other things he talked about the importance of a guru, in music and in life. It was not enough to find one but to be able to venerate him. The occasion was the birth centenary of guru G. N. Swamy. T.V. Gopa\u000alakrishnan (TVG), a disciple of G.N. Swamy, has made his mark as a mridangam artiste, vocalist and teacher. It was Swamy, his father&#8217;s brother, who initiated him into the magic of the mridangam.In a three-day music festival held to mark the event, a concert by TVG on the final day had the vocalist selecting traditional ragas and kritis. Khamas was the main raga for the day.The all-time favourite Vasudevachar krithi &#8216;Brocheva re varura&#8230;&#8217; flowed with ease.  He interspersed the composition with a talk about his own shishyas.S. Varadarajan (violin), Thiruvarur Baktavalsalam (mridangam) and another member of the family, T. V. Vasan, (ghatom) were the accompanists.&#8216;Entamuddo&#8230;,&#8217; a Tyagaraja kriti in Bindumalini, and the time-tested &#8216;Vathapi&#8230;&#8217; sung in the Chembai style were the pick of the concert.Sangeeth Gopal, a young link in this long music chain, impressed the audience with his performance on the final day too. A bank employee, Sangeeth still finds time to hone his talent and his concert was ample proof of his &#8216;tapasya.&#8217;The kriti &#8216;Rama nipai tanaku&#8230;&#8217; was in a sense reflective of his own passion. In the short time allotted to him, Sangeeth made an effective exposition of ragas such as Sahana, Kedaram, Rasikapriya, Mohanam, Sreeranjini et al. He was accompanied by Satish Varma (violin), Ayamanam Chandrakumar (mridangam) and his father Thripunithura Gopalakrishnan on the ganjira.Parassala Ponnammal seems to be getting better with age.  Starting off with a varnam in Anandabhairavi, on the second day, she kept the audience engrossed with a ragamaalika and an elaborate, well-planned exposition of Panduvarali.Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi (violin), Jayakrishnan (mridangam) and Koval Suresh (ghatom) provided excellent back-up.A violin duet by Thodupuzha R. Manojkumar and Kottayam Upendran that was held before the vocal concert rocked. Right from &#8216;Bhajamahe&#8230;&#8217; in Hamsadwani, with which they opened, it was one racing, pulsating recital. Both the violinists, who complemented each other, were in  tandem as they went on to play &#8216;Sudhamayi&#8230;&#8217; in Amrithavarshini, and &#8216;Raghuvamsasudha&#8230;&#8217; (Kadanakuthuhalam). They brought about a change in atmosphere by playing Dwijavanti and Hemavati, the main raga,  softly.The festival got off to an enthralling start with a mesmerising flute recital by Shantala Subramaniam and a  scholarly concert by K. Vagesh. Shantala&#8217;s playing of Lathangi, the main raga of the concert, was spiced up with hypnotic swara passages.&#8216;Nibhakti bhagya&#8230;&#8217; in Jayamanohari and &#8216;Akhiladeswari&#8230;&#8217; in Dwijavanti were simply out of the world. She was accompanied by Sampath (violin), Balakrishna Kamath (mridangam) and Udupi Sreekanth (ghatom).A ragam-tanam-palavi in Khamboji, &#8216;Evarani nirnayimchirira&#8230;&#8217; in Devamrithavarshini, &#8216;Jaya Jaya Swamin&#8230;&#8217; in Natta and a thillana in Khamas were the highpoints of Vagesh&#8217;s concert.Sampath, (violin), Palladom Ravi (mridangam) and Udupi Sridhar (ghatom) matched the vocalist&#8217;s every note.The three-day music festival was organised by G.N. Swamy Trust and Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha, Thripunithura.G. N. Swamy Trust honoured T. V. Gopalakrishnan for his  contributions to classical music and awarded scholarships to students of its music school.
