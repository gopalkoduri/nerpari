VRight from his school days, Chandran Nayar used to write poems.   He was a regular at the `mushairas' in Jamshedpur where his father was working.  This went on even after Chandran got a  job in Tisco. His life took a  different turn in 1987 when he chucked his job and joined a professional drama troupe from Kerala that had reached Jamshedpur  as part of an all-India tour.For a while, poetry took a backseat as Chandran travelled with the troupe.  He tried unsuccessfully to make it in films.  In 1992, he published his first collection of poems titled `Velippadukkal.' And now he has come with what he claims to be "original Malayalam ghazals."`Orithal Poovu' has eight soulful ghazals by Chandran and set to music by Roopesh-Murali, who composed the music for the film `Balaram vs. Taradas' and for more than 60-odd albums."Ghazals have a strict pattern in its themes and construction, which is usually not adhered to in most of our Malayalam ghazals. I have tried to follow it faithfully," claims Chandran.The album has introduced two relatively new singers, Reghu Ram and Abhilash Ramu. The  theme of the album is romance.Though some of the images bring back memories of popular Malayalam film hits, it does not take away the gloss. `Raavu muzhuvanum maunam... .,' with which the album opens, `Manassu thannittu marakkan... ' and `Nilavinte kalabham nirayum... ' are the pick of the songs.Chandran is ready for the next album, which will have music by Prakash Ullyeri, an eminent harmonium player who makes his debut as music director in the forthcoming film `Sketch.'K.
