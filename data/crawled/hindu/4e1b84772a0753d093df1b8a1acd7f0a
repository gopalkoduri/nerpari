VAjay Namboodiri subscribed to the &#8216;tread softly&#8217; approach in his concert for Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha at Vani Mahal. With a vocabulary that banked on tonal modulation for expressiveness, melody gained primacy. The Anandabhairavai alapana achieved smooth passage over gently undulating terrain to Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Kamalamba Samrakshathu Mam.&#8217;The artist&#8217;s Natakurinji delineation favoured the highlighting of the madhyama during the ascending phase, in keeping with the mood of the Swati Tirunal composition &#8216;Mamava Sada Varade&#8217;. Tara sthayi excursions did not balk at scaling hard-to-reach summits, with moments of whimsy balanced by definitive pidis. The extensive concluding swara round was crowned with a korvai that laid emphasis on aesthetic gilding of the kanakku.With an effective filler in Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Parathpara&#8217; (Vachaspathi), brisk appended kalpanaswaras ensured that the concert pace gained much needed momentum at this point.Much of the action in Todi, the main piece, centred around the tara sthayi shadja and gandhara. Prayogas wheeled and dipped to converge at swaroopa-affirming destinations. However, greater punch in articulation would have maximised overall impact of both alapana and the majestic Muthuswami Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Sri Krishnam Bhaja Manasa&#8217;. Neraval and swaram opted for the road oft travelled.Karaikal S. Venkatasubramanian (violin) and Arjun Narayanan (mridangam) offered unobtrusive support, plumping up the vocalist&#8217;s efforts during lean patches.
