VWhen played with sensitivity, there is in the music of the violin  accents that are closely akin to human voices. Many a moment in T.H. Subramaniam&#8217;s violin solo gave the illusion that a vocalist had taken his place in the concert.  Subramaniam imparted such delicacy and such dexterity of  technique that the sixth K. C. Kalyanasundaram Bhagavathar commemorative concert  at Thripunithura  was a veritable treat.Subramaniam began his  recital with a Ada tala varnam in Sankarabharanam, warming up with a neat exhibition of Shanmukhapriya, with the  Dikshitar kriti &#8216;Siddhi Vinayakam.&#8217;The highpoint of the concert was certainly the ragamaalika. He began with the Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Maajanaki&#8230;&#8217; in Khamboji. He got into an elaboration of the raga and moved on to other ragas such as  Sahana, Kapi, Behag, Sindhubhairavi and so on.  Whether in elongated phrases or in a staccato one, there was pinpoint precision.This was followed by a thaniavarthanam on the mridangam by Changanassery B. Harikumar. Although one thought it would not have the desired impact without the interactive role of the ghatam, Harikumar used all his experience to take the audience to a different rhythm sphere.Anandabhairavi (&#8216;Marivere&#8230;&#8217;), Gowrimanohari (&#8216;Gurulekha&#8230;&#8217;) and a chaste Poorvikalyani (&#8216;Njanamo sagarada&#8230;&#8217;) were rendered with a firm grip over &#8216;laya.&#8217; At the end of the two-hour concert the effect of Subramaniam&#8217;s violin,  was simply soothing.Before the concert, family and friends of Kalayanasundaram Bhagavathar, who organised the event, honoured mridangam maestro Mavelikkara Velukutty Nair.
