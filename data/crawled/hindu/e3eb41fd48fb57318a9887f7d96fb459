VLIZA GEORGEIt was a magical evening at  Museum Auditorium, Thiruvananthapuram, as three young prodigies  -   Julian Clef, Jan Sham Brouwer and Akita Ganapathy  -   took listeners on a musical journey.The 5th Bach Festival held to mark the death anniversary of the great composer Johann Sebastian Bach, was also a tribute to Hans Muller, a philanthropist, who passed away last year.The evening began with songs by Grace Verseen, accompanied by Julian Clef on the piano. A trained singer from the United States of America (U.S.), Grace's rendering of the devotional song, `Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring,' started the concert on a sweet note.The agony of a woman who is unsure about opening her heart to her lover was portrayed in the Italian song, `Gira Con Me,' sung by Grace.Faure's `Beceuse Op. 16' by Jan Sham and Julian charmed the audience. An accomplished violinist, 13-year-old Jan from Mysore handled the bow with ease and expertise as 16-year-old Julian, a student of Chetham's School of Music, United Kingdom, traversed the scales of the piano with deftness and skill. While the former had faint strains of a folk tune, the following piece, Bach's `Concerto in E Major BMV 1042,' in Adagio, was a mournful  aria as the violin  weaved in and around the notes of the piano.Pianist and singerMozart's `Sonato No. 15 in D Major,' in three movements  -   Allegro, Adante and Allegretto  -   by Ankita Ganapathy showcased her talent. A second-year student of engineering, she is also a talented Carnatic singer.A piece by Julian, `Grand Sonate No, 21 Op. 53' (Waldstein) by Beethoven, in three movements, was followed by Chopin's `Nocturne Op. 27 No. 2.' Manuel Nessan, as a tribute to Hans Muller, recited a poem written by him, entitled `The Melting Strings.'Grace took the stage again with `Sheep may graze safely,' and `You raise me up.' The latter, which requires the singer to sing in various pitches, had Grace sailing through, never hitting a false note.Foot-tapping musicThe audience tapped their feet to the lively renditions of Handel's `Sonata in F major Op. 1 No. 12,' and Shubert's `Sonata for violin and piano Op. 137 No. 1 (D584),' by Jan and Julian.Chopin's `Nocturne Op. 48 No. 1 in C minor' and Shubert's `Impromptu in D, third movement in B flat,' found Ankita at her best as she effortlessly navigated the keys. An evening piece, Ankita's rendition of Chopin, serenaded the listeners.The finale was by Julian who played Listz's `Hungarian Rhapsody.'The melancholic strain, in which it begins, gradually picked up pace and had the audience swaying to the tune, feet a-tapping. A truly grand finale.Bottom Template Starts
