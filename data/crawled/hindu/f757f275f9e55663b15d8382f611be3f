VIf one nursed a thought that  academicians (in music) cannot impress as performers as their theoretical approach comes in the way one should listen to  young Harish Narayanan. He is a promising performer with an equally earnest attitude to his doctoral degree in music as he proved in his concert for Hamsadhwani at the Youth Hostel.When a singer makes a fine selection of ragas and compositions, the concert automatically turns impressive. Harish Narayanan's array included the bright Vasantha varnam, brisk Nattai (the impeccable `Sarseeruha sanapriye') and vivacious Kedaragowla (lively `Venugana loluni'). The choice and the pliant and deep voice of Harish left one asking for more.Generally, the mantrasthayi sancharas elude vocalists but they come naturally and with clarity for Harish, who is comfortable in the upper registers also. The initial essay of Kedaragowla and the later Simhendramadyamam (`Ninne nammithinayya') almost shared equal importance and duration. The niraval and neatly linked groups of several rounds of sarva lagu swaras at `Vikasitha pankaja vadanalu' in `Venugana loluni' and `Pannakendra sayana' in `Ninne nammithi' portrayed the splendor of the ragas as well as Harish's musical acuity. With focus on emotion and repose in raga delineations, Harish can go far.Amrutha Murali on the violin matched perfectly with the vocalist's mood and method but the same time added her own improvisations in raga essays, niraval and kalpanaswaras. R Sankaranarayanan on the mridangam provided dynamic support.G. SWAMINATHANBottom Template Starts
