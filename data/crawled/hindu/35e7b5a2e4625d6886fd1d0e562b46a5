VA senior artist who is known for his musical acumen and quality of expression, Pt. Vinayak Torvi could be singled out for his outstanding performance at Narada Gana Sabha, under the auspices of Carnatica&#8217;s Bharat Utsav 2008, in association with Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha.A banker turned professional musician, Pt. Torvi projected a powerful, highly cultured voice in his morning melody &#8216;Ramkali Aaja Radhe Tori&#8217;  in Bhairav.Interlacing the song with the most beautiful badat in words and syllables, alaps in meend with appropriate khatkas and murkis and varying broad expansive taan patterns, Pt. Torvi sang in a deep resonant voice that bore the stamp of a maestro. He followed it with the alliterative dhrut piece, &#8216;Sagri Nain Ke&#8217;, replete with ras and bhav. The audience especially enjoyed the taans sung by Torvi, while the mukhra was sung by his disciples, Dattatreya Valenkar and Badsheshe.Lalit was taken up on popular request in both vilambit and dhrut. Two madhya laya pieces in Jaunpuri and Shudsarang were delineated with great aplomb. Three bhajans in Kannada, Hindi and Marathi of Saints Purandaradasa, Kabir and Tukaram were sung making it an interactive morning.Pt. Vinyak Torvi is a product of Gurukulavasa where he spent 12 years and learnt under Gururao Deshpande, the doyen of the Gwalior gharana. He has been exposed to both the Gwalior and Agra gayaki. But even traces of Kirana style are evident as his gayaki also emits that serenity which is a hallmark of the Kirana school. This influence is also endorsed by the fact that as a post graduate student in the Karnatak University at Dharwar, he came under the tutelage of all-time greats such as Gangubai Hangal, Pt. Basavaraj Rajaguru and Pt. Mallikarjun Mansoor. Dignified and humble, Pt. Torvi still takes guidance from stalwarts such as Pt. Bhimsen Joshi.Ravindra Katoti on the harmonium synchronised excellently and was close to vocal. The sawaal jawabs on the tabla were lively; the high point of the rendition on the tabla by Ravindra Yavagal showcased the taal pattern in which the taan was taken, eg. if the taan had the Dadra ang or the zhaptal ang, he matched it perfectly on the tabla.
