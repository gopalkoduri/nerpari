VThe first major vocal concert in connection with the Thripunithura Sree Poornathrayeesa temple festival was by Thoppur B. Sairam.A disciple of Trichy Ganesan, he began his concert in perfect alignment with the sruthi. A  varnam &#8216;Karunimpa&#8217; in Sahana and &#8216;Vathapi&#8217; were adorned by a cascade of swaras. &#8216;Manavinaala&#8217; in Nalinakanthi was followed by Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Saadhujana&#8217; in Lathangi. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;O Rangasayee&#8217; in Kambhoji was also rendered. He was accompanied by V.V. Ravi on the violin, Mavelikara Raju on the mridangam and Adichanallur Anilkumar on the ghatom.Kavalam Srikumar&#8217;s concert saw him rendering a melodious Amrithavarshani coupled with the Balamuralikrishna composition &#8216;Sidhivinayakena.&#8217;  &#8216;Sarasiruhaasana priye&#8217; in Natta  was preceded by a winding &#8216;Saantham&#8217; in Dwijavanthi. Neelakanta Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Aananda nata&#8217; and Swati Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Sathataham&#8217; in Kharaharapriya were the other compositions rendered.C. Rajendran (violin), Parassala Ravi (mridangam), and Gopinatha Prabhu (ghatom) were the accompanists.Padma S. Thampuran, Geetha Dinesh, Seetha Sunil, A.R. Anju and E.P. Subha Kumari bewitched the rasikas on the third day as they played their veenas  in unison. Aneesh K. Vasudev (mridangam) and Irinjalakkuda P. Nandakumar (edakka) provided excellent percussion.Prasanna Venkitaraman&#8217;s musical prowess charmed the  listeners.  He began with the Ata tala varnam in Bhairavi, &#8216;Gaanamoorthe.&#8217; The piece was laced with kalpana swaras that proved to be a treat for the rasikas. Initially trained by Thripunithura Balamani, Prasanna is now a student of Sanjay Subrahmanian.Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Santhanagopala&#8217; in Kamas and Pattanam Subrahmania Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;Aparadha mulanniyu&#8217; in Lathangi was followed by Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Nayaki&#8217; in Ranganayakam. Attukal Balasubramaniam, R. Vaidyanathan and P.L. Sudhir accompanied on the violin, mridangam and ghatam respectively.T.M. Krishna&#8217;s dash and erudition never fail to enchant his audiences. The torrent of swaras attached to &#8216;Naadathanu Manisham&#8217; in Chitharanjini, a Tyagaraja composition, and &#8216;Inthakanna Yaananda&#8217; in Bilahari by the same poet-composer had the listeners spell-bound. &#8216;Maamava Sadaa&#8217; in Kanada was followed by Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Chethasree&#8217; in Dwijavanthi and a classic rendering of Syama Sasthri&#8217;s &#8216;Kamakshi,&#8217; in Bhairavi, which won the applause of the listeners. R.K. Sriramkumar carefully followed the vocalist while  K.V. Prasad played some cholkettus on the mridangam. Udipi Sreedhar (ghatom) did not lag behind.Hyderabad Sisters, Lalitha and Haripriya, enthralled rasikas with their in-sync performance. They began their concert with &#8216;Endaro Mahanubhavulu,&#8217; followed by &#8216;Teliyaleru&#8217; in Dhenuka and &#8216;Mokshamu&#8217; in Saaramathi. &#8216;Maal marukaa shanmukhaa&#8217; in Vasantha, &#8216;Appa Ramabhakthi&#8217; in Panthuvarali and &#8216;Pakkala&#8217; in Kharaharapriya were the other compositions rendered. Tanjavur Subrahmaniam (mridangam) and Ravichandran (ghatom) showed excellent team work as they accompanied the vocalists.A violin duet by B. Sashikumar and Balabhaskar was well appreciated. Apart from familiar ragas such as Naattakurinji and Hamsadhwani, ragas such as Kanjabhavapriya,  Naatakapriya,  Sidhivinayakam,  Janaranjini  and Mandari  were also tackled.The speed and control with which the duo played &#8216;Parama purusha&#8217; in Vasantha was exhilarating. A composition in Kapi, enmeshed in Adi, Rupakam and Chappu (Muthalam) revealed the  understanding between uncle and  nephew. When Changanasseri Harikumar plays the mridangam, any concert will be enlivened by his clarity of fingering, alacrity and mastery.Vaikom Gopalakrishnan was superb on the ghatom.Carnatic music concerts are said to have been developed on the tradition of Harikatha, and those vocalists who are familiar with that art, show pithiness in &#8216;alapana,&#8217; clarity  in diction and a hard-earned discipline in the realm of swara- rendition.Malladi Brothers, (Sriram Prasad and Ravikumar, whose grandfather Sriramamoorthy was a noted Harikatha exponent) gave glimpses of Voletti Venkateswaralu and Nedunoori Krishnamoorthy, the two powerful streams of Andhra vocal music. It was Ravikumar who started the concert with &#8216;Praananatha,&#8217; a rare composition of Tyagaraja in Sankarabharanam.Sriram showcased his vocals with &#8216;Etla dorikitivo&#8217; in Vasantha as Ravikumar brought out the various shades of Dwijavanthi. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Yochana&#8217; in Darbar and &#8216;Paramaatmudu&#8217; in Vaagadheeswari were well etched out.Sriram Prasad came up with a ravishing Kalyani, and the brothers sang Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Ninnu vinaagathi&#8217; with &#233;lan. T.H. Subrahmaniam accompanied on the violin. Visakhapattana V.V. Ramanamoorthy on the mridangam enthralled the audience with his absorbing  left-right hand combination.Tripunithura Radhakrishnan was impressive on the ghatom. Tripunithura Sankarakrishnan with the flute and later Tripunithura K. Girija Varma (vocal), had set up  the mood for the Malladi Brothers&#8217; concert.
