VThe Erode Tamil Isai Sangam\u000ahad recently organised\u000athe veena recital of vocalist S.\u000aSowmya.The popular vocalist, S.\u000aSowmya, developed throat irritation\u000awhich made her resort\u000ato another unfolded\u000atalent of playing veena. We\u000aheard and enjoyed the best of\u000ait that day.Even at a very young age,\u000aSowmya had inherited a large\u000arepertoire (about 400 kirtanas\u000aof Tyagaraja ) from her\u000afather who had learnt them\u000afrom S.P. Natrajan, the senior\u000amost disciple of flute\u000aMali. It was from the day\u000ashe joined Dr. Ramanathan,\u000athat her musical foundation\u000aand progressive development\u000agained strength and\u000afirmness both in vocal and\u000aveena.Neat renditionWith the soft plucking of\u000athe veena, her recitals in\u000ageneral, struck immediate\u000arapport with the audience.Starting with `Gajavadana'\u000ain Sri Ranjani, `Maya Thirtha\u000aSwarupini' in Mayamalavagowla,\u000a`Singara Velavan\u000aVandan' in Ananda Bhairavi,\u000a`Kaliyuga Varadan' in Brindavana\u000aSaranga, were well\u000arendered.It is an unwritten law that\u000awhen a raga is rendered,\u000aswaras shall not peep in, and\u000awhen kalpanaswaras are\u000arendered, the raga should\u000aenvelop every swara with its\u000aproper gamaka. Sowmya's\u000aboth raga and swara renditions\u000abear testimony to this\u000arule. Thodi was taken up for\u000aelaboration. Clarity in diction,\u000aperfect presentation of\u000athe gamut of the raga with\u000adeep devotional fervour and\u000aher unhurried approach\u000awere enjoyable.High musical excellence\u000awith ingredients of chaste\u000amusic in the raga, swara and\u000akirtana renditions bore the\u000astamp of Dr. Ramanathan.S.R. Vinu's Thodi was excellent.\u000aK.V. Gopalakrishnan's\u000amridangam and T. Raj\u000aGanesh's ganjira sustained\u000athe tempo throughout the\u000aperformance and their thani\u000akept the audience spellbound.Anjaneya Park, the venue,\u000awas surcharged with chaste\u000aand melodious veena music\u000aof Sowmya.
