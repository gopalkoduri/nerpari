VGARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMIt was the turn of Delhi Sunderrajan (now based in Chennai), the reputed young violinist on Monday, to dispel the suggestion echoed whenever a multifaceted artiste tries his hand at something different &#151;  that there are neatly drawn boundaries between vocal and instrumental music.His maiden vocal recital for Nungambakkam Cultural Academy was a powerful reminder that compartmentalisation in those terms, is at best a matter of a convenient division of labour and not underpinned by some deeper virtue.Sunderrajan's voice bore little trace of a novice plodding his way through an unusual terrain. A slight touch of hesitation in the opening lines of `Vatapi Ganapatim Bhaje,' soon gave way to some full-throated singing. The Tyagaraja kriti `Nenarunchara Naapai,' in ragam Simhavahini, the Muthu Thandavar song in Kamas, `Theruvil Varano Ennai Satru Tirumbi Parano,' and Kabir's bhajan `Beetu Gaye Din Bhajan Binare,' added spark to the three-hour recital.A testBut Sunderrajan should put his remarkable vocal stamina to better and more intelligent use than tread the rather familiar path of many contemporary singers. `Appa Rama Bhakti' and `Kaddanuvaraki Kaddu,' the Tyagaraja kritis in ragas Pantuvarali and Hanumatodi respectively were made ornate with neraval and kalpanaswaram. Here, Sunderrajan was probably testing his own stamina, or trying to assess the response from his audience when he attempted those brigas in the above compositions. Additionally, he must be well aware that for some time to come, his singing will inevitably be judged against his formidable reputation as a distinguished violinist and hence should take particular care to enunciate the lyrics.`Varanasyam Varapradam,' and `Vatapi Ganapatim Bhaje,' are not, after all, so complex  that you have to disturb their structure while singing.Vittal Ramamurthy (violin), Thiruvaarur Bakthavatsalam (mridangam) and Vaikom Gopalakrishnan (ghatam) were the fortunate trio who shared the floor with Sunderrajan on what was a particularly memorable evening for the vocalist.Bottom Template Starts
