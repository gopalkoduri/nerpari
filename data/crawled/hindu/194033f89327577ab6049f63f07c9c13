VA jugalbandi was arranged by Sangeethapriya at Raga Sudha Hall, where a happy confluence of the Carnatic and Hindustani systems was sought to be realised. Narmadha (on the violin) and Injikkudi Subramaniam (on the nagaswaram) were able to achieve  th\u000ais substantially when they played Raag Purya Dhanasri and Pantuvarali in a parallel manner presenting characteristic expressions stamped with the  singular grace and beauty each tradition is known for.Subramaniam played the ragam as an intelligent mix of crowned waiting notes and zestful single-breath brigas, and even ventured to present the adhi mandhara sthayi, where the demanding governing principle is an extraordinarily sensitive ear and an exalted awareness of the swarasthanam. As with all violinists, solos mean freedom for the artists in terms of improvisations which leads to glowing creativity. Narmadha showed that she is a rich  spring of manodharma as she applied her mind to cultivate thoughts on the two Indian musical systems and presented them with equal facility.What was accessible to the modern consciousness through this concert was that these two streams of music have their own respectable ideals and core values. &#8220;One is not, therefore, more equal than the other.&#8221;It was still quite unexpected when the first three pieces &#8211; &#8216;Maha Ganapathim&#8217; (Naatai, Dikshithar), &#8216;Sudha Mayee(Amrithavarshini, Muthiah Bhagavatar) and Pakkala Nilabadi (Kharaharapriya, Tyagaraja) &#8212; were presented by the duo between them in the regular concert-like fashion, though the alapana of Kharaharapriya had  aesthetics and maturity in nuances quite typical of the vadhyams and vidhwans occupying the stage.Subramaniam  shrugged off underplay that he had cast upon himself till this moment and thereby unravelled the immense potential of Narmadha too. Ganapathyraman on the mridangam and Gopalakrishnan on the ganjira accompanied with a keen sense of layam that was both spirited and controlled in keeping with the mood.  They gave a fine but restricted thani that had many well-calculated and well-conceived phrases. This concert was held at Raga Sudha Hall.Sanjay Subramanian&#8217;s concerts have their own orbits and hence, their own dimensions. Three pulsating alapanas of near identical depth, and width, with their high level of skill and sophistication left one wondering  which among them was main.  Two of Goplakrishna Bharati&#8217;s compositions, &#8216;Innamum Sandhega&#8217; (Keeravani) and &#8216;Thiruvadi Charanam&#8217; (Khambodi) were rendered with a devout fidelity to the original. The progressive and orderly rendering of the sangatis of the pallavi for the Khambodi kriti evoked an atmosphere of divine feelings. The other kriti was &#8216;Brovabaarama&#8217; (Bahudari, Tyagaraja).Virutham singing rests upon two planks of significance and has a particular character of its own. The longs and shorts of the lyrics &#8212; Kuril and Nedil &#8212; have to be uttered with impeccable diction and should be aesthetically couched in well-rounded prayogas of the chosen ragas. The rendering of the virutham &#8216;Poothavale&#8217; in Durbari and Behag, was done with firm and complete adherence to these norms. Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s song, &#8216;Karpagambigai&#8217; (Behag) followed.M.R. Gopinath on the violin showed that  he was well and truly unified with that of the main artist and his alapanas and swara replies reflected his experience.Thanjavur Ramdas on the mridangam provided sollus and nadais that fitted ideally with the trend of the sangatis; his sruti alignment, which was a little awry in the beginning was set right later.Govindarajan on the ghatam maintained a nadham that had a stunning consistency and together with Ramdas provided a thani that was rich in its exposition of vidwat.This concert was part of a series of kutcheris being held at the Warren Road Balavinayakar temple. It was heartening to see an assembly of rasikas who did not move even as the concert extended beyond 11 p.m.
