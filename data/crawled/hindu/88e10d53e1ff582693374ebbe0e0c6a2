VIn this age of unrest and frenetic lifestyle, devotional music serves as a balm, reiterating its relevance. To keep pace with the times, many musicians and composers have tried to give these songs a contemporary touch by orchestrating them to suit changing audience tastes.In his latest devotional titled &#8216;Sri Rama Dootam&#8217; which extols the virtues of Lord Rama and his prime devotee Hanuman, composer-singer Ramesh Vinayakam has come up with tunes which reflect musical styles from across the globe. &#8220;I would like to compare this album to a rainbow,&#8221; he says during a chat. &#8220;Each of the seven pieces has a distinct musical flavour, though the goal is one&#8230; a heartfelt prayer to the Divine.&#8221;Besides composing the tunes, Ramesh has also penned the lyrics for two numbers &#8212; &#8216;Hey Gananatha&#8217; (he has sung it too) that has a raw, rustic feel to it, and the title track, a straightforward Sanskrit kriti in raga Manirangu and sung ably by Nithyasree Mahadevan.Ask him about the Sanskrit lyrics and he says, &#8220;Actually, I do not know a word of the language! I guess I imbibed a lot by just listening to Sanskrit verses. Of course, after writing the song, I got it verified by a Sanskrit scholar.&#8221;Another noteworthy aspect is that acclaimed Hindustani singer Sanjeev Abhyankar makes his &#8216;Tamil debut&#8217; by singing two numbers, the classical-based &#8216;Vanara Kula&#8217; and &#8216;Hare Rama,&#8217; which has a global feel. If the voices of 11-year-olds Manaswini, Ovia and Srinidhi burst with happiness and cheer in &#8216;Karunayile&#8217;, the sombre chanting of Prakash Kaushik in &#8216;Sheksha Valli&#8217; has a reverberating effect. The others who have lent their voices are Sharreth for the folksy &#8216;Hanuman Paadham&#8217;, and Saindhivi and four-year-old Pranav for the breezy &#8216;Jai Hanuman&#8217;.Talking about the genesis of the album, Ramesh says, &#8220;I believe it is a Divine call that results in all my devotional albums taking shape. As for &#8216;Sri Rama Dootam,&#8217; a series of happy coincidences led to it being made.&#8221;The composer has worked on six other devotionals including the highly successful &#8216;Moksha Mantras of Shiva&#8217; (&#8220;Lalgudi sir heard it recently and came to my studio to congratulate me.&#8221;) and &#8216;Krishna Janardhana.&#8217;On the style of compositions in the album, he says, &#8220;It was a conscious decision to set the numbers in different genres of music. I believe music is a manifestation of the divinity in man. By setting each of the songs to unusual tunes, I want to send the message that what matters more is the message. How it is packaged is only secondary.&#8221;Ramesh&#8217;s unusual choice of certain instruments such as the harp and saxophone for devotionals is a point to note. If only the names of the artists who played these instruments and lent their creative touches to the songs found a mention on the inlay cover!Also, there is hardly any information about the compositions or the style they are set in. These would definitely have added to the overall production value and would be useful to listeners.(Sri Rama Dootam is produced by Shivaswamy Subramaniam and marketed by Swathi Soft Solutions (ph: 24984050/ 42316060). It is priced Rs. 75.)Sanjeev's Tamil debutSanjeev Abhyankar\u000amakes his Tamil debut\u000awith `Sri Rama Dootam'.\u000a"In fact, this is the first\u000aSouth Indian language I\u000ahave sung in," he says. His\u000anear-perfect Tamil diction\u000awhile singing the two bhajans\u000ais a plus point to the\u000aalbum. "I had no clue that I\u000ahad to sing in Tamil, till I\u000awalked into the studio to\u000arecord," says Sanjeev. "But\u000ahaving said that, I was excited\u000aat the challenge\u000athrown at me at such short\u000anotice. I trusted Ramesh\u000acompletely, and am happy\u000awith the outcome." Sanjeev\u000awrote down the song\u000ain Devanagari script with\u000athe meaning of each line,\u000agrasped the essence and\u000athen sang. "What matters\u000aare the aesthetics and the\u000aemotions. In devotional\u000amusic, words are important\u000abut the bhava matters\u000amore. I hope I have managed\u000ato capture that."
