VCurt Sachs in his book, &#8216;The History of Musical Instruments,' says, the saxophone &#8220;being intermediate between the timbres of wood and brass instruments, passes from the softness of the flute over the broad, mellow tone of the cello to the metallic strength of the cornet.&#8221;Wielding this instrument charmingly, he plays it with acquired confidence. Eyes closed, he is lost in his own music&#8230;yet he engages the audience and expresses his thoughts responsibly between the numbers.The studio at KM Music Conservatory, Chennai, is packed to capacity with young minds enthralled by his hour-long-rendering. Neil is 19 and is studying Humanities at the Soka University (Southern California).The concert, sans accompaniments, began with a selection from Charlie Parker. It was followed by a number from Bach's 18th book.&#8216;The Girl from Ipanema' from Bosso Nova was the next choice that has a small briefing about Bosso Nova and its &#8220;minimalistic orientations.&#8221; Mouthpieces with their different caves, circular and square, were deployed depending on the genre rendered. Neil explains their usage in explicit terms for the benefit of the learners present. &#8216;Wave' comes up next and Neil highlights the unique phrasing of the melody and the proper selection from the many chords that were there &#8220;all the time&#8221;.In conversationAs one talks to him, Neil emerges as a music personality.Neil's effort at forming a one-man-band, a kind of really a work-in-progress, where he joins versions of other instrumentalists, some of them played by him, is was also mentioned here with its due relevance.He became part of the Class V band at school and chose sax, though his initial exposure was when he watched a street jazz player perform at New Orleans, at age two. &#8220;The initial sound when I played the instrument was a mere honk but that was motivation enough.&#8221;He has been learning sax formally from the age of 10 under Professor Jim Merod. &#8220;I was fortunate enough to be with my professor when he was conversing with jazz guitarist Peter Sprague &#8211; an encounter that changed my life, creating an even deeper appreciation of the art.&#8221; Neil's knowledge of the sax has a studied depth.&#8220;France was the birth place of the sax. The instrument may not be of wood, but still belongs to the woodwind family. In the brass family of instruments, the sound is produced from the buzzing of the lips. The woodwinds' sounds are generated from the vibrating reed in the mouthpiece. Each sax stands alone and differences in lacquer or engravings can alter the sound - slightly or even drastically.&#8221;He adds, &#8220;Most of the nuances are created by the embouchure (the forming of the lips around the mouthpiece). The quality of the sound ultimately depends on one's breath support, which has to be strong and steady. As each person's mouth is shaped differently, what works for one may not be compatible for the other. This gets reflected in the personal nature of saxophone playing.&#8221;He also talks of reed-care. &#8220;Since reeds are made of cuts of bamboo, they can mould rather easily when exposed to humidity. Shaping and filing them, or simply guarding them from moulding is a tedious yet essential process that sax players must be steadfast about.&#8221;The Carnatic saxophone, and Kadri Gopalnath draw his admiration. &#8220;The nuances of Carnatic saxophone demand that one mimics the same fluidity of the voice on an instrument which does not have the same fluidity especially between notes. Mastering that prowess and being able to have that much control over one's sound is truly remarkable. It needs a lifetime.&#8221;His dream? &#8220;If I am able to be a full time musician and still provide for myself and my family, it will be a dream come true. I also love reading and writing, for prose (and language) is art as well. Art is the most effective medicine for everything. I love to write about music, and I hope to be a music journalist.&#8221;
