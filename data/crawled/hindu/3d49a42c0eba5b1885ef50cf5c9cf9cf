VChitra Srikrishna, accompanied by M.S. Govindaswamy (violin) and C. Cheluvaraju (mridanga) presented a vocal concert as part of the 72 {+n} {+d} Sree Ramanavami Celebrations of the Sree Ramaseva Mandali, Bangalore, last week.&#8220;Jayajayajaya Janakikantha&#8221; in Natta raga and khanda chaputala and &#8220;Theliyalaru Rama&#8221; in Dhenuka raga and aditala preceded a methodical and well-articulated alapana of Harikamboji that maintained the conventional classical identity of the raga. A mellow &#8220;Rama Nannu Brovara&#8221; in rupaka tala, featuring a fine neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Meppulakai Kannathavu&#8221;, was followed by a polished rendering of the Deekshithar composition &#8220;Rame Bharathapalitha Rajyamarpayami&#8221; in Jyothi raga and khanda chapu thala.A short but mellifluous alapana of Hindolam, during the course of which the plain dhaivatha was highlighted to great effect, and the composition &#8220;Rama Nama&#8221; set to rupaka thala, led to the main raga of the recital, Simhendramadhyamam. The strength, clarity and flexibility of the artiste's voice were evident in the alapana which progressed in measured phrases and incorporated a plethora of sancharas around the thara sthayi shadja and rishabha. Swathi Thirunal's &#8220;Ramarama Gunaseema&#8221; in adi tala, sung in a sedate tempo commensurate with the weighty nature of the composition, was supplemented with a comprehensive neraval at &#8220;Munimanasadhama&#8221;, kalpana swaras that ended with a stint of diminishing thala cycles at the tara sthayi rishabha, and a brief tani avarthana.Meticulous planning and a sense of proportion in the construction of items, aided by able support from the accompanying artistes, contributed much to the success of the concert.The Sri Ramanavami Celebrations of the Sri Seshadripuram Ramaseva Samithi featured a concert by vocalist Saraswathi Vidyarthi, accompanied by Nalina Mohan (violin), N.Vasudev (mridanga) and A.S.N. Swami (kanjira), recently.The recital began with Thyagaraja's &#8220;Brovabharama&#8221; in Bahudhari raga and adi tala, suffixed with profuse kalpana swaras. A succinct alapana of Darbar preceded &#8220;Aparadhamula&#8221; in khanda chapu thala, which was also followed by several rounds of kalpana swaras. Keeravani was elaborated with a distinct focus on the tara sthayi, adhering strictly to the Carnatic idiom with several gamaka-laden phrases. &#8220;Kaligiyunte&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in aditala was presented with a compact neraval at &#8220;Baguga Sriraghuramuni&#8221; and plentiful kalpana swaras that encompassed some final rhythm oriented avartanas around the panchama.A lively &#8220;Vararagalaya&#8221; in Chenchukamboji raga and adi tala was precursor to the main item of the evening, a raga tana pallavi in Hamir Kalyani. The raga alapana was richly ornamented with a multitude of intricate phrases, sprinkled with bhrigas and punctuated with long rests on pivotal notes, ascending gradually up to and dwelling on the tara sthayi panchama, and revealing the full scope of the raga. The brisk tana was succeeded by the pallavi beginning &#8220;Sri Rama Raghurama&#8221;, set to khanda jathi thriputa thala and taking off from an ateeta graha, an exposition of abundant improvisational powers, spontaneity and technical prowess. The kalpana swaras, which included some ragamalika swaras, alternated between the first and second speeds and an occasional variation in gathi, saw the violinist and percussionists responding with alacrity.
