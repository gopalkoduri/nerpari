VThe 48 {+t} {+h} Sadguru Tyaga Brahma Aradhana Mahotsavam, held at Srirangam, Tiruchi, on February 10, began with a Vigneshwara puja. Sita Kalyanam was performed on Feb. 13.Srirangam was rife with divine music during the two weeks that followed.The inaugural concert was by Bangalore Pattabirama Pandit with T.V. Ramanujacharyalu (violin), Harikumar (mridangam) and Krishna (ghatam). Music exponents offered homage to the sacred bard on the successive days.The other artists who performed during the aradhana included Rithvik Raja (vocal), Sheik Subhani and Kalishabi Subhani (nagaswaram), Shankar Ganesh (vocal), Mudicondan Ramesh (veena), Embar Kasturi and Rengachari (vocal) and Swarna Rethas (vocal).Meenakshi Rajagopal captivated everybody with her classic rendering of popular pieces of the saint in her absorbing voice. Her &#8216;Ramakatha Sudha' (Madhyamavathi) and &#8216;Nee Daya Radha' (Vasanthabhairavi) were masterpieces, presented with much felicity and consummate skill.T.H. Vasantha (violin), Nellai Balaji (mridangam) and Ravikrishnan (ghatam) lent able support to her delectable renditions.Aishwarya Vidya Ragunath, an &#8216;A' grade artist of the AIR, drew the audience by her soulful singing. She rendered &#8216;O Ranga Sayee' (Khambodi) and &#8216;Entharo' (Harikhambodi), replete with multiple charanams and amazing swaras.Kolkata Vijayaraghavan, a disciple of Madurai Seshagopalan, captivated everybody with his &#8216;Bala Kanaka' (Atana). He was accompanied by T.H. Vasantha an AIR artist, on the violin, Umayalpuram Mali on the mridangam and Rajaganesh on the ganjira.It was a pleasure to listen to the renditions of Tiruchi Ramesh, T. V. Ramanujacharyalu, Madhwaprasadh and Aruna Renganathan on the following days.The flute recital by the legend, N. Ramani with Nagai Muralidharan (violin), Salem Srinivasan (mridangam) and Srirangam Kannan (morsing) scaled great peaks by providing the niceties of classical and chaste music. His &#8216;Nidhi Chala' (Kalyani) and &#8216;O Ranga Sayee' (Khambodi), with apt and fast swaras and sargams would be long cherished.The fingering prowess of Nagai Muralidharan, the percussion support of Salem Srinivasan and the morsing of Srirangam Kannan made the concert enjoyable.Sanjay Subramanian (vocal) with Nagai Muralidharan (violin), Neyveli Venakatesh (mridangam) and Rajaganesh (ganjira) established his expertise by fearlessly travelling into the unexplored paths of Carnatic music.He sang &#8216;Meru Samana' (Mayamalavagowla) followed by two kritis in Mohanam with assertive arrogance and treated Sankarabharanam (&#8216;Budhiradi') threadbare and capped in his tukkadas, &#8216;Rinamadanutha' (Hindustani Behag), &#8216;Chalamelara' (Marga Hindolam) and &#8216;Orumaiudan' (ragamalika).It was a star-studded performance by T. M. Krishna, whose power-packed delivery sent the audience into raptures. Starting with a pacy &#8216;O Ranga Sayee' (Khambodi), a touching Kannada Gowla and an expressive and extensive Sri (&#8216;Tyagaraja Mahadvajaaroh'), he touched the high and low of every kriti to the pleasure of the listeners. His lighter pieces which included &#8216;Sabapathiku' (Abhogi), &#8216;Bantu Reeti' (Hamsanadam), &#8216;Pagaivanukarulvai' (ragamalika) were a picture of poise and sukham. It was a grand accompaniment of R.K. Srikumar (violin), and the tala trio, Ganapathiraman (mridangam), Athreya (ganjira) and Krishna (ghatam) that spurred the spirit of the rasikas and made the concert memorable.Sangeetha Sivakumar's, was a heart-warming recital. She never deviated from the grammar of Carnatic music.Beginning with &#8216;Yathuna Pol' (Bhairavam), &#8216;Vachara Gocharame' (Hamsanadam), &#8216;Nee Vada Ne' (Saranga), with consummate ease, her extensive Bhairavi (&#8216;Upacharamu') was superb. Sure she could easily reach higher octaves of each raga. The accompaniments &#8211; R.K. Sriramkumar (violin) and Ganpathiraman (mridangam) added glory to the concert.The vocal concert of Sikkil Gurucharan accompanied by Ganesh Prasad on the violin, Ganapathiraman on the mridangam and Tiruchi Murali on the ghatam was different and enjoyable.His &#8216;Thathvamariya' (Ritigowla), &#8216;Shyamasundara' (Dhanyasi) and &#8216;Vinatha Sudha Vahana' (Jayanthasena) were pieces of sukham and his treatment of Kalyani for the kriti &#8216;Suthari Ki,' rendered with sweet swarams and sargams, sans frills, was a pleasure to listen to. Earlier Pancharatna kritis were sung by eminent musicans.The cultural fiesta drew to a close with Aruna Renganathan's vocal concert and Anjaneya Utsavam on February 27.
