VAmrita Varshini, a new cultural body in Vijayawada, organised a music and dance programme at Gokaraju Laila Gangaraju Kala Vedika. The chief guest of the function was veteran folk arts exponent Karnati Lakshmi Narasiah. The programme was inaugurated by violin vidushi V. Krishnaveni and it was presided over by vocal vidwan Modumudi Sudhakar. Actor V. Hazarattaiah Gupta was also an honoured guest.The first part of the programme was a pleasing vocal concert by 17-year-old J.S. Sriram, a worthy disciple of well-known violin vidwan Akella Mallikharjuna Sarma and son of J.S. Eeswara Prasad, a reputed bhajan singer and dancer. Singing for the first time in Vijayawada Sriram effectively began his concert with Viriboni varnam in Bhairavi rendering it in trikalas.Exhibiting musical depth and uncanny laya control he next sang Bhavanuta of Thyagaraja in Mohana adorning it with fine raga and crisp kalpana swaras.The main item of the concert Prakkala Nilanbadi in Kharaharapriya made a fine impact on the audience. Sriram's ability in rendering manodharmam aspects came to light in this item. Detailed raga elaboration, bhava laden niraval and intricate kalpana swaras made the keertan highly enjoyable.Sriram had excellent support from O. Rajasekhar on the violin and K. Rajagopalachari on the mridangam. Rajasekhar's versions of Mohana and Kharaharapriya were very impressive and the tani played by Rajagopalachari in Chapu talam was thrilling. The concert came to a close with Ramasakhe, a tarangam in Pahadi and a pleasing thillana in Rageswari.Sriram's vocal concert was followed by impressive group dances by disciples of Natyacharya Ajaykumar, a staff member of the Government College of Music and dances. Several Kuchipudi items were neatly performed by the 18 member strong group.
