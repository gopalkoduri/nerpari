VThe conference president  Palghat R. Raghu presented a lecture demonstration on the multi-faceted splendour of misram.  Palghat Raghu was assisted  by his grandsons &#8212; Abhishek Raghuram (vocal) and A. Anand (mridangam) &#8212; and Mysore Srikanth on the violin.The Khanta Ata Tala varnam Viribhoni is Bhairavi was taken up. The total of khanta ata thalam being 14 beats and this figure double of 7, Abhishek rendered it while Anand accompanied him weaving all the other nadais  into his playing. In the vocal rendition also Abhishek changed the nadais accurately and all of them fell into the thala round correctly. The varnam was also rendered in Adi Thalam which is 16 matras.Anand gave a brilliant exposition of a Thani, conceived by  Palghat Raghu in Misra Chapu Thalam. The thani composition was exceptional with all the combinations of the other nadais woven intricately into the pattern.As many as six ragas were discussed under raga Lakshana derivatives of the 22nd melakarta. Madhyamavathi was handled by Vainika Vidushi Vidya Shankar.Madhyamavathi is an audava ragam with five swarams in both Arohana and Avarohana. The swarasthanams are Shadjam, Chatusruti Rishabam, Suddha Madhyamam, Panchamam, and Kaisiki Nishadam. With the help of the veena, the veteran vainika  demonstrated the gamaka patterns of the swaras in the ragam.  The prayogams from major compositions were taken up as illustrations for the gamaka movement. Madhyamavati is an auspicious ragam used for mangalam also.Vidwan V. Subrahmaniam, S.A.K.Durga and T.R.Subramaniam dealt with other ragas.
