VThe &#8216;Sapthaprahara Pradakshinam&#8217; festival celebrated under the auspices of the &#8216;Aravamutha Iyengar and Pankajavalli Ammal Memorial Trust&#8217; in Srirangam proved its mettle in more than one aspect.The seven-day festival was primarily aimed at offering worship around the seven &#8216;prakarams&#8217; of Srirangam Sri Ranganathar Temple daily in the morning, In the evening, it provided a musical feast to the quality audience.&#8220;This festival falls once in seven years,&#8221; remarks  A. Raman, the trustee and Mythily Jaganathan, the organiser.The vocal concert by O. S. Thyagarajan on the fifth day of the festival formed one of the major highlights of the celebrations.  Thyagarajan chose both popular kritis  and  exclusive kritis on Srirangam,  delighting the audience to a great extent.The kriti  by Saint Tyagaraja  &#8216;Juthaamu Rare&#8217; appealing to Lord Ranganathar in &#8216;Arabi&#8217; ragam, was a more timely invocation,  as the audience had gathered after worshiping Lord Ranganathar during the course of the &#8216;Pagal Pathu&#8217; of the Vaikunta Ekadasi festival then in progress at Srirangam.The kriti &#8216;Pahima Hare&#8217; in Pannagajayi ragam was followed by &#8216;Ethuda&#8217; in his unique style. Through his precision in alapana and shrillness in rendition, the audience could well experience the bhavam and the essence of the kirtana.Laced with timely handling of complex components of the ragams and exhibiting his unique capability of possessing the audience through his melodious voice,  Thyagarajan&#8217;s mastery came to the fore in his handling the Varali ragam.The kirtana &#8216;Momujeeba Krishna&#8217; in Behag ragam and the tillana in Brindavana Saranga were other important highlights of the concert.He started with Tyagaraja kriti &#8216;Vinatha Sudavaha&#8217; in Jayantha Sena ragam. The main raga chosen for that day was Sankarabharanam (&#8216;Yathudaneelachithey&#8217;). He elaborately rendered the concert in the raga alapana and the keerthana and he did niraval for the charanam, &#8216;Tharana Dhorakani&#8217; where he sang kalpanaswaram in  two kalams.The thani avartanam of Mannargudi Eswaran was excellent for the same song which is in adi talam &#8216;Eretta kalai&#8217; chowkam. He also sang Khambodi raga alapana and sang a Tamil composition &#8216;Rangam Srirangam.&#8217;Ramanujacharyalu who accompanied on the violin was a very good support and he played the two ragas Khambodi and Shankarabharanam. Coimbatore Mohanram also did his best to accompany Eswaran. The tani avartanam was very interesting and short.
