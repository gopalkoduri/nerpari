VG. Ravi Kiran, accompanied by C.N. Chandrasekhar (violin), and K.U. Jayachandra Rao, presented a vocal concert under the auspices of the Music Circle, Bangalore, last weekend. The recital was set on a course of unambiguous and uncompromising classicism with a fine rendition of &#8220;Ninnu Juchi&#8221;, the Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer composition in Sourashtram raga and aditala, to which were appended a few avarthanas of kalpana swaras at &#8220;Vanajasanadi&#8221;. A mellow &#8220;Evarikai Avatharamethithivo&#8221;, Thyagaraja's krithi in Devamanohari raga and misra chapu thala followed, also featuring fluent kalpana swaras. Dhanyasi was then elaborated with quintessential gamaka-laden sancharas interspersed with a variety of patterns and brighas that highlighted, in particular, the nishada and the thara sthayi madhyama. Papanasam Sivan's &#8220;Balakrishnan Padamalar&#8221; in rupaka tala, along with a bhava-laden neraval and kalpana swaras constituted a finely crafted item that was notable for its strict adherence to tradition.&#8220;Tholinenu Jesina&#8221;, a Thyagaraja krithi in the rare raga Kokiladhwani, was the engaging interlude before an exhaustive expansion of Purvikalyani. Impressive voice control and range, individuality, and an abundance of manodharma were revealed in the plethora of phrases that traversed the three octaves effortlessly. Though the immense scope of the raga was explored in great detail, at times one felt that a subtle suggestion of a musical idea, rather than the explicit and detailed pursuit to its logical and obvious conclusion would have proved more effective and aesthetically appealing. Ramanad Srinivasa Iyengar's &#8220;Paramapavana Rama&#8221; in aditala, sung in an ideal kalapramana that illumined its imposing structure and lyrical beauty, was embellished with a remarkable neraval at &#8220;Kanakambaradhara&#8221;, with appropriate melodic and rhythmic support from the accompanying artistes. While the kalpana swaras in the first speed were extensive, those in the second speed were comparatively brief, and were followed by a thani avarthana.A vocal concert by Dr. B.R. Padmanabha Rao, accompanied by Dr.S. Nataraja Murthy (violin), and G.L. Ramesh (mridanga), was hosted by the Rajamahal Vilas Sangeetha Sabha recently.The performance commenced with &#8220;Ninnukori&#8221;, the adi thala varna in Vasantha raga. A brief outline of Saraswathi prefaced the GNB composition &#8220;Saraswathi Namosthuthe&#8221; in rupaka thala, supplemented with kalpana swaras, and was succeeded by a short sketch of Sama and Deekshithar's &#8220;Annapoorne Vishalakshi&#8221; set to aditala.A quick detour of Simhendramadhyama was followed by an unhurried and attractive presentation of Mysore Vasudevacharya's &#8220;Ninne Nammithi&#8221; set to misra chapu thala, augmented by a neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Pannagendra Shayana&#8221;. The succeeding composition, Thyagaraja's &#8220;Entha Muddo&#8221; in Bindumalini raga and aditala, was evocative and one of the best pieces of the concert.The alapana of the main raga of the evening, Madhyamavathi, was mellifluous and of moderate length, and suffixed with Shyama Shasthri's &#8220;Palinchu Kamakshi&#8221; in adi thala, embellished with a succinct and uncomplicated neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Kanthamaguperu&#8221;, underscored by unstinted cooperation from the accompanists. &#8220;Bhavayami Gopalabalam&#8221; in Yamunakalyani was among the concluding compositions. Though the performance included some exquisite selections, greater spontaneity in the improvisational aspects and more emphatic control over laya would have enhanced the overall impact.
