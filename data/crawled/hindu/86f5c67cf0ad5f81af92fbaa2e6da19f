VGifted with a bright voice that permits free flow of brigas, Bangalore Ramamani, a disciple of R.K. Srikantan and K.V. Narayanaswamy presented a concert where lesser known compositions were brought to fore and interspersed with popular ones. She was \u000afeatured this past last week end in the Monsoon Music Marvel series jointly organised by Balaganamrutham, Chennai and KCP, Bangalore, at Srinivasa Sastri Hall, Mylapore.&#8216;Saranambe Vani&#8217; (Gambiranattai-Adi-Purandara Dasar) was among the rare ones. Purvikalyani saw her sketch the raga with an unusual approach.The supple  voice made her reach the panchama of the tara sthayi with ease. Seasoned campaigner R. Hemalatha&#8217;s replies were equally competent.Mysore Sadashiva Rao&#8217;s &#8216;Gangadhara Tripuraharana&#8217; (Rupakam) was the kriti where she took up the niraval in Haribhushana with rakti phrases followed by swaras that were free flowing. Thanjavur Kumar (mridangam) and Pudukottai S Ramachandran (ghatam) gave their support very well in this phase embellishing the proceedings with great  anticipation.Surprisingly Ramamani took up niraval once again in &#8216;Sabapathikku Veru Deivam&#8217; (Abhogi-Rupakam-Gopalakrishna Bharati).Ramamani cleverly camouflaged the foreign notes that crept in during the pallavi phase of this song. Her Nayaki alapana at a sedate pace was a soul stirring effort.She took extra care to see that she did not encroach  into Durbar, the allied raga. Lengthy karvais in the nishadam, time and again were meditative. Considering the pace of the alapana, &#8216;Ranganayakam&#8217; (Muthuswamy Dikshitar-Adi) was the apt choice.&#8216;Vandeham Shive&#8217; (Kathanakuthoohalam-Chatusra Matya-Jayachamaraja Wodiyar) presented briskly, enlivened the atmosphere.This set the mood for the major raga of the evening Bhairavi. Replete with classic phrases the raga was showcased in varying speeds. Ramamani sounds a lot like MLV, particularly in the bhriga oriented phrases. Hemelatha&#8217;s delineation was interesting. &#8216;Raksha Bettaray&#8217; (Tyagaraja-Adi) was completed with niraval and swaras leading to a crisp and well planned thani by Thanjavur Kumar and Pudukottai Ramachandran.
