VPendyala Nageswara Rao's Sangeetha Vibhavari, organised in Kalabharati on Monday evening, was a show that brought back some sweet memories and haunting melodies of the legendary music director.The audience also went nostalgic while being treated to gems from legendary playback singer Ghantasala's repertoire.B.A. Narayana from Vizianagaram, a trained classical vocalist  who has built for himself a reputation for being one of the best imitators of Ghantasala's voice, drew repeated applause with his performance.His choices included difficult songs likeNandunicharithamufromJayabheri, duetKondagaali TirigindifromUyyala-Jampala, Malladi'sRasikaraajafromJayabheri, Pingali'sSivasankarifromJagadekaveeruni Kathaand the first fourslokasofDevistutifrom Kalidasa. The other song that attracted equally loud applause was Malladi'sRaagamayi RaavefromJayabherithat was rendered with facile charm by Chandrasekhar.Similar efforts by M. Sasi Rani and T. Estir Rani, who imitated the voices of Suseela and Jikki, singing songs likeNeevundedaakondapaiof Devulapalli fromBhagyarekhaandNeelimeghalalofromBavamaruduludid not go entirely futile.Kalasravanthi, an association of light music exponents, teachers and singers founded and headed by K.S. Chandrasekhar organised the event. The programme got off to an auspicious start with the rendering ofSuklambaradharam slokamfollowed byVatapiby Raghavulu that brought out the intense fervour with which Ghantasala sang them forVinayakachavithi.The man who managed and conducted the orchestra, Chandrasekhar, has enjoyed the privilege of being an assistant for renowned music directors Ramesh Naidu and Ghantasala for about a decade before he joined the Akashavani studios at Visakhapatnama as light music composer.He is also known for singingghazalsset to music by himself. He played on the harmonium as well along with Raji and Ch. Srinivas on the keyboard, K. Vijayasri on violin, Rambabu with the tabla, Siva on the pads and  Kurmanatham on the flute.Akashvani announcer Rambhatla Nrisimha Sarma went exuberantly poetic while compering. Guests of honour, AU Vice-Chancellor L. Venugopal Reddy and business magnate Khasim Mehdi felicitated the renowned singer of Ghantasala's songs, K.S. Veera Raghavulu (who was also the prime disciple of the legendary singer), on the occasion.A. RAMALINGA SASTRYBottom Template Starts
