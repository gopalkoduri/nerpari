VSharade Pahimam, a thematic concert by vocalist G. Ravikiran at the Seva Sadan on Saturday was part of the music festival conducted by Hamsadhwani Creations, Bangalore. He was accompanied by C.N. Chandrasekhar (violin), V. Krishna (mridanga), and G. Guruprasanna (khanjari).The concert got off to a lively start with &#8220;Saraseeruhasanapriye&#8221; in Nattai, followed by &#8220;Bharathi Maddhishana Jaadyaapahe&#8221;, the Dikshithar krithi in Devamanohari set to rupaka tala. A soulful alapana of Hindolam prefaced &#8220;Mamavathu Sreesaraswathi&#8221;, ornamented with short kalpana swaras confined to single avarthanas of the adi tala cycle. The delineation of Devagandhari was based on a systematic analysis of its scope, the phrases brimming with raga bhava. &#8220;Sharade Veenavadana Visharade&#8221;, an exquisite composition by Papanasam Sivan was a fine choice, rendered with due consideration to its lyrical and structural merits. On the whole, the vocalist&#8217;s clear enunciation of the text also underscored the beauty of the compositions.Bhairavi, the main raga of the evening, was elaborated in detail. The sancharas from the mandra panchama in gradual progression to the tara shadja revealed commendable maturity, but the effect was somewhat diminished by an avalanche of brigha-laden phrases in the tara sthayi. The Swathi Thirunal krithi &#8220;Janani Mamava&#8221; in misra chapu tala was supplemented with a splendid neraval at &#8220;Anupamitha Kamalaavaase&#8221;, and kalpana swaras notable for a lengthy, gamaka-oriented passage in the lower speed, which imparted a sense of consummate fulfilment to the concert as a whole. The talented young vocalist&#8217;s creativity, rooted in tradition, was supported by brilliant violin and percussion accompaniment.* * * * &#8195;Usha Ramamurthy, accompanied by V.S. Rajagopal (mridanga) and T.N. Ramesh (ghata), presented a gottuvadya recital on Sunday at the Ananya Sabhangana under the auspices of the Malleswaram Sangeetha Sabha.Beginning with &#8220;Chalamela&#8221;, the adi tala varna in Khamas, the artiste proceeded to &#8220;Neeve Palinchara&#8221; a beautiful krithi in Chakravaka composed by Mysore Karigiri Rao, suffixed with kalpana swaras remarkable for their purity and clarity. The Vijayasree composition &#8220;Varanarada&#8221; and &#8220;Akhilandeswari&#8221; in Dwijavanthi were preceded by brief alapanas of the respective ragas, highlighting the full range of the deep and rich gamakas characteristic of the ragas.The wistful melody of Dharmavathi was evoked in an alapana that included lucid phrases below the mandra panchama and above the tara panchama. Mysore Vasudevacharya&#8217;s kriti in rupaka tala, &#8220;Bhajanaseyarada&#8221;, was accentuated with neraval and kalpana swaras imbued with raga bhava. A change of pace and mood was effected with &#8220;Smarajanakashubhacharitha&#8221;, the Swathi Tirunal krithi in Behag set to misra chapu tala, and &#8220;Lalithambe&#8221;, a composition of Mysore Venkatagiriyappa in the uncommon raga Bhuvanagandhari.The uniqueness of the instrument conferred a special quality on the mellow portrayal of Shankarabharana, which was founded on the conventional image of the raga.Well-honed artistry was evident in the rendition of &#8220;Sarojadalanethri&#8221;, the Shyama Shastri composition set to adi tala. Unobtrusive rhythmic patterns were deftly woven into the systematic neraval and kalpana swaras, ending with an elaborate thani avarthana.The concert concluded with &#8220;Rama Rama&#8221; the Purandaradasa devarnama in Tilang, and a piece in Sindhubhairavi composed by Mysore Doreswami Iyengar.MADHAVI RAMKUMAR
