VN.Ch.Buchayyacharyulu and his son Kousik Kalyan belong to the reputed musical family of the legendary late N.Ch. Krishnamacharulu . Many descendents and close relatives of Nallan Chakravartula family are all musicians in one form or another, mostly in Carnatic classical. Buchyyacharyulu is currently working as a lecturer in Govt. College of music and dance and is a good theoretician too.The Muthuswami Deekshitar's 236th Jayanthi celebrated at Thyagarya Ganasabha's Kala Subba Rao's Kala Vedika organised by Saptaswara Samskruthika Samstha run by another known vocalist K.S.R. Balakrishna Sastry last week was marked by a brief discourse of Buchayyacharyulu on unique contribution of Deekshitar.This was followed by a concert by Kousik Kalyan, a National Awardee in All India Radio competitions and others. He was accompanied by N.C. Anantha Krishna on violin and N.C.S. Varada Raju on mridangam. Kalyan revealed good vocal culture that pointed at his gift and good learning.All the compositions were of Muthuswamy Deekshitar and Kalyan, in rendering them displayed care and precision in the expression of Sanskrit Sahitya with proper punctuation that never troubled him from the flow of the musical part. He opened with Vaatapi Ganapathim in Hamsadhwani with a compatible swarakalpana, maintaining melody throughout. Pavanaatmajaagacha in Naata in Khanda chaapu talam set a good standard for the concert.Govardhana Gireesam in Hindolam, Roopaka Taalam was the next number that opened with the raga essay by the young artiste, revealing his rich imagination. He rendered the raga with speed and clarity. The kirtana rendition was sweet with perfect import of sahitya. The swarakalpana was with a smooth flow.&#8216;Meenakshime Mudamdehi' in Poorvikalyani was the main number of the concert set in Adi Talam. The raga essay was brilliant and the kalpana swaras, with a liberal dose of purposeful swaras tagged to the kriti also reflected his Manodharma. Violinist who followed him like a shadow excelled equally. The mridangist adjusting himself to the main artist's style proved a deft hand.&#8216;Kamalamba' in Anandabhairavi, a Navarna kirtana in Misra chaapu taalam and &#8216;Marakata- valleem' in Kambhoji were the final numbers of Kalyan.He also rendered a composition &#8216;Sri Durga' that his father Buchayyacharylu wrote on goddess Kanakadurga of Vijayawada and set in Raag Durga that went well in the same vein of the festive mood.
