Another rare composition\u000abeautifully rendered by Raja Rao\u000awas Yuktamugadu in Sri ragam. His gentle\u000aapproach in establishing the raga\u000abhavas was evident in the major items\u000aRama nee yeda in Kharaharapriya and\u000aSambho Mahadeva in Pantuvarali. His\u000aalapanas was expansive but attractive.Rama nee yeda was performed well\u000awith efficient swara kalpana accompanied\u000aby tani on mridangam by K.Sadgucharan.\u000aB.V.Durga Bhavani, a\u000aseasoned violinist proved her mettle and\u000aplayed the versions of Pantuvarali and\u000aKharaharapriya melodiously.
