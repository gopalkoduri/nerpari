VGARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMCommemorative events do take on a routine and ritual-like character sooner or later and such criticism is heard even in relation to the annual Tyagaraja aradana, although every year a new city joins the long list of places that observe the remembrance. But the music that was put together to mark the third anniversary (on Tuesday) of the doyen Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer's passing away was a refreshingly different occasion, primarily due to the spirited singing from the groups led by the legend's disciples, the renowned P.S.Narayanaswami and Meera Kedaranathan.V.Subrahmanyam and Sita Rajan, the other two senior students, settled for a rather modest task of leading the singing of compositions that were favourites with Semmangudi  -   a selection from the repertoire of Syama Sastri and Muthuswami Dikshitar.There was a contemporary flavour in each of the kritis presented by Meera's team. Most of these have been penned by K.R.Kedaranathan while the others are better known melodies of Ambujam Krishna. Surely, the singing of "Enna Naan Pizhai Seiduvitten," in Todi and "Malaimeedulavum Malmaruga," in Khamas called for some imaginative division of labour among the artistes, rather than the entire choir singing them together. This would have better defined the role of each participant, allowed listeners to identify individual voices and enhanced the overall impact of the singing. The point was reinforced while listening to the charanam of "Janakivallabha Namaste," the Ambujam Krishna piece, which incidentally has been set to tune by Meera in ragam Dharmavati that sounded a little off-key.Formidable line-upThe distinguished P.S.Narayanaswami, who led the next team, showed great wisdom (perhaps pragmatism) having separate groups of men and women to sing some of the rare kritis of Tyagaraja. His formidable line-up which included among others, the young and illustrious Abhishek Raghuram, master Balamuralikrishna and M.R.Subramanyam delighted the audience with the piece in Kalyani "Vachchunuhari Ninujooda Mechchunuhari Ninujoochi," followed by "Neeku Tanaku," in Begada and "Yennado Rakshinchite," in Saurashtra.Charumathi Raghuraman, who featured in the earlier two groups as an accompanist, this time doubled as a vocalist along with Swati Krishna and others. Notable in their performance was the kriti in ragam Devagandhari and "Yevarumanakusamanamilalo," and "Raghunandana" in Suddhadesi.V.V.Ravi on the violin and the two percussionists on the mridangam, Tiruchur Narendran and Satishkumar provided splendid support.Bottom Template Starts
