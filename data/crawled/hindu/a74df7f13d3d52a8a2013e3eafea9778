VFlautist V. Nagaraju is an AIR staff artiste and has already given more than 2000 performances all over the state and in other parts of the country. His experience and scholarship was on display during a performance for Sujanaranjani at the venue in Hanuman Devasthanam complex, Sanathnagar.Nagaraju was brilliant in  manodharma as also in his playing skills.He could produce a soothing sound, running fingers on the holes, without breaks contributing to a continuous melody.His repertoire was tradition-bound, dominated by popular compositions of Thyagaraja.One advantage in playing these Thygaraja compositions was that the audience could easily follow the text of what he was playing.Nagaraju opened with aNavaragamalika varnamthat prepared him well with enough exercise for presentation of the rest of the numbers.Vatapi, an invocation, was a popular choice in Hamsadhwani with fineswaraprasthara.From then on, most of the compositions he presented were of Thyagaraja.Srirama Paadamain Amrutavauhini was a number that carried the sweetness of the raga.He played with a vocalist&#8217;s touch. There was a quickie, an instrumental delight,Manavi Alakincharadatein Nalinakanthi that proved a good break before he took up the first raga essay of the concert,Kapi. He dealt with the raga adding some nuances here and there.Neevalla Gunadoshamemiwas his choicekritiin this and theswarakalpanawas reasonably expansive. He later presentedNiravadhisukhadain Ravichandrika.The major showpiece of Nagaraju&#8217;s concert was Kalyani essay for Thyagaraja&#8217;sYetavunara Nilakada Neeku. The delineation of the raga was quite absorbing for the way he built it up into upper octaves.At every stage, he added his virtuoso skills and finally gave an imposing look to the popular melody and maintained the tempo inmandra sthayiparts.Thekritipresentation was again with a vocalist&#8217;s verve. He carried this melodic lilt in theswarakalpanatoo, which, by itself was quite interesting. Violinist R. Dinakar gave his own version of the essay, creating synergetic effect.At this stage, experienced mridangam maestro Kapa Srinivasa Rao put to view his percussionist skills inTani Avartanam.The latter part had Swati Tirunal&#8217;sViswswara Darsanain Sindhu Bhairavi and a crispTillanain Dhanasri. Both the accompanists are seasoned artistes.Together, they elevated Nagaraju&#8217;s flute show to the status of a fine orchestra presentation.
