VK. Vandana from Visakhapattanam has a rich and pliable voice from which gamakas unreel, thus making  compositions rendered by her linger in the minds of the listeners.This disciple of Manda Sudharani, who is also being trained by eminent violist I. Vijayeswara Rao of the Dwaram Venkata Swamy Naidu style, charmed rasikas during her vocal concert  at Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha,  Thripunithura.The concert started with  the padavarnam &#8216;Chalamela&#8217; in Naattakurinji, composed by  Moolai Veedu Rangaswami Nattuvanar.Mayamalavagowla was well rendered and &#8216;Deva deva&#8217; was embellished with niravel as well as swaras. Sudha Saveri had a plethora of sangathis in Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Daarini.&#8217;The piece  proved her calibre as the composition is said to have ancient alankaaras (musical decorations) cleverly grafted to it.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Nannu Vidachi&#8217; was preceded by a  short sketch of Reethi Gowla. It was  followed by Panthuvarali. &#8216;Raghuvara nannu,&#8217; in which Tyagaraja pledges his love for  Lord Rama, was a devotional piece.A lucid Bhairavi was tagged to thaanam, and the pallavi woven into Anandabhairavi and Vasanthabhairavi took the concert to its climax.K.V. Krishna brilliantly accompanied on the violin. Both K. Ramesh on the mridangam and Udipi Balakrishnan on the ghatam ably supported the vocalist.
