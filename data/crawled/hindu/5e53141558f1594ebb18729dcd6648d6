VThe Ayodhya Mandapam featured a veena recital by R. Parthasarathy, supported by Anantharaman. The opening strains of Nattai ushered in the ubiquitous &#8216;Maha Ganapathim&#8217; (Muthuswami Dikshitar) in which the significant stopover at &#8216;Mahaakaavya Naatakaadhipriyam&#8217; embellished by crisp mridangam sollus drew attention to the line. Melody-aligned kalpanaswaras were rounded off by apt poruttams.The mellow sketch of Malayamarudham and the refreshing lilt of &#8216;Manasaa Etulorthune&#8217; (Tyagaraja) infused joy into a rendition impeccably representative of vocalised lyric.A contemplative, non-virtuoso Amritavarshini espoused dynamic Carnatic cadences, yet drew upon the serenity of Hindustani sensibilities, particularly when skimming the pratimadhyama and panchama in the upper octave. Masterful touches in &#8216;Aanandaamruthakarshini&#8217; evoked the majesty inherent in Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s compositions, with an ebullient swirl of swarakalpana fanning across octaves. The high-energy &#8216;Sobillu&#8217; (Jaganmohini, Tyagaraja) with rousing chittaswaram touched the right chord, evoking spontaneous applause.Bahudari countenanced none of the characteristic &#8216;lightness&#8217; associated with its interpretation, but instead, was nourished by vadi-samvadi devices and sturdy, hard-won gamakas that stamped prayogas with dignity, the octave-spanning sancharas displaying both felicity and sobriety. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Brovabaarama&#8217; inspired a scintillating swara segment. &#8216;Ramabhadra Ra Ra&#8217; in Anandhabhairavi drizzled benevolent grace, in consonance with the evening&#8217;s weather. Silky glides lent grace to the main Hemavathi alapana punctuated by panchama and shadja-varja phrasing that swept across sthayis to touch the ati tarasthayi shadja with minimal ado. The tanam rippled with artistic intensity while Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Sri Kanthimathim&#8217; emphasised the value of traditional patanthara.Leisurely kizhkala swaras resonated with raga bhava and melkala swaras with kuraippu displayed verve. The artist&#8217;s approach to kriti rendition merits special mention, as each sangati bore the lucidity of crystal-clear articulation.In son-in-law Anantharaman, Parthasarathy the guru, has groomed a talented disciple reassuringly entrenched in the enduring values of classicism as was evidenced by his contribution to the swara exchange in Hemavathi. Kumbakonam Ramakrishnan (mridangam) and Nirgunam Shankar (kanjira) participated in a lively exchange in their tani avartanam, volleying nadai changes with consummate ease.
