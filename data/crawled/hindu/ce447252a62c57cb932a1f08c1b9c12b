VHyderabad Music Circle, a noted music sabha run by senior musicians, last week organised a pleasing vocal recital  by M. V. Kamala Ramani in the company of R. Dinkar on the violin, A. Srinivas on the mridangam and Janardhan on the ghatam at the Thyagaraya Gana Sabha.Kamala Ramani is an experienced and talented vocalist and a guru too, who has been spreading the cause of Carnatic music by teaching many children and providing them with concert opportunities.She displays a good grip over the grammar of serious music right in her Darbar Varnam and went forSwaminatha Paripaalayain Nata of Dikshitar. She gave a brief sketch of the raga, choosing some beautiful phrases and swaras that were well planned and extensively presented.Guruvaayurappanein Reetigoula of Ambujam Krishna was another impressive devotional before she took up as her major raga effort, Poorvi Kalyani. She developed it with leisurely grace, decorating it with some nuances here and there. Thyagaraja&#8217;sGjnanamosagaraadain Rupaka Talam was her choice number in this raga and rendered with Sahitya Bhava. Thenerevalwas vivid with pure intonation, while theswaraprstharawas quite elaborate and imaginative.Ranganathudein Sourashtra in Rupaka talam was Kamala Ramani&#8217;s next number, Ponnayya Pillai&#8217;s composition. And she rendered it as a well-chosen kriti.Sariyevvarammain Bhairavi of Syama Sastry was a good number with raga essay and scintillatingswarakalpna, preparing ground for the percussionists to present Tani Avartanam. The percussionists had done a good job.The later items includedGovindamihain Abheri of Narayana Theertha,Adi Devain Sindhu Bhairavi and a Thillana in Khamas.
