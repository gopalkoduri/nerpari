VRamakanth and Umakanth (Gundecha Brothers), Ravikumar and Sriramprasad (Malladi Brothers) were excited as they were to sing at Hotel Taj Coramandel, Chennai, shortly. It seemed like net-practice as one peeped into their joint concert-planning session at their place of stay. Their manifesto like pallavi said everything, quintessentially. &#8216;Bharathiya Sangeethame Madhuram Swararagalaya,' meaning to convey the concept that Indian music extends beyond the North and the South, is sweet to one's ears (Then Vandhu Payudhu Kadhinile) and has as its components the swara, the raga and the laya.Accompanying violinist Embar Kannan was there as the &#8220;utility man&#8221; suggesting some small strategies in its execution, together with mridangist Mahadevu Lakshmi Narayana Raju . The brothers (Gundecha and Malladi) were eager to talk. Excerpts:The Gundecha brothers are no strangers to Chennai and have performed here as early as 1985 at The Music Academy. Disciples of the incomparable Dagar brothers (Fariddudin and Mohiuddin), the Gundechas have held the dhrupad-flag aloft.Is dhrupad burdened with songs on Lord Shiva? &#8220;Our gurus were Jains. Muslims have sung dhrupads without hesitation. Religion, nationality or other beliefs were never an issue. What mattered most was the musical element in them. Can anyone hide reality?&#8221; they ask.The brothers were destined to be duet performers and their preparatory work from childhood was towards this end. Living and singing together was of prime importance, as the understanding and mindset had to be formed and maintained. They have a Dhrupad Institute in Bhopal, functioning in the formal gurukula format, where students live in a hostel. They are provided with a library facility that includes (apart from books) audio and video too. During their siksha period, the brothers had faced the difficulty of finding a place to stay and hence this idea. There are 25 students there. &#8220;We have targeted the lower-middle class, who cannot afford to take up this art and provide scholarships for the needy&#8221;.On form of dhrupadOf dhrupad they say that, &#8220;The very form of dhrupad makes it easier to blend (with Carnatic music) and will serve as a bridge between these two great vistas of music. We have known the Malladi Brothers for a long time and it is thrilling to be singing with them.Incidentally, Gundecha brothers have bagged the Rajat Kamal award for composing music for the non-feature film, &#8216;Raga of River Narmadha.' The brothers are not a twosome, but a trio. Akilesh Gundecha provides accompaniment on the pakhwaj. They have travelled to many countries, where they have won fans.Chennai rasikas know the Malladi Brothers too well. They learnt music from Sarvashree Sripada Pinakapani, Nedunuri, Voleti, their grandfather Srirama Murthy, their father (Suri Babu) and uncle (chithappa) Narayana Sharma. &#8220;A parampara that has endowed us with Gurubalam.&#8221;Duets became a part of their performance, as they constantly accompanied their father and uncle on stage. The Malladi Brothers have been singing from age six, &#8220;We are two years apart in age&#8221;, and have been delighting the audiences for the past 30 years. They became aware of renowned combinations such as Alathur Brothers or Raman and Lakshmanan, only after they started performing. Their kutheries are planned to cover all composers, Swathi Thirunal, The Trinity and Sivan. When in comes to alapana sharing, it &#8220;depends on the mood&#8221;. If they feel the other's manodharma is brimming and ready to flow, then the alapana's next phase will pass on, else the one who begins it will go ahead with its completion. &#8220;What wavelength you are tuned to, is the deciding factor.&#8221; Singing in India, our &#8220;Karmakshethram,&#8221; is a rewarding experience and they also feel that the European tours are of great significance.They had sung before a Dutch audience where a pure Saveri or a pure Sankarabaranam saw the &#8220;rasikas&#8221; equally mesmerised both with the raga designs, its embellishments and kriti elaborations.If you have not listened to the brothers' learning sessions with their guru Nedunuri (on SVBC channel every Tuesday), you have missed two things - education and enjoyment. The brothers share this as the interview winds up: &#8220;The Sangeetha Ratnakaram of Sharnga Deva was written in Kashmir, we, here in South India, are the ones using it most.&#8221;The Gundecha and Malladi Brothers are in perfect unison when they say, &#8220;Chennai welcomes experiments like this and we have come together for a great cause, as this is a fund-raising event for cancer. We feel we are contributing our mite here in helping in its eradication. This is the need of the hour. It is a beginning, and we hope that more sustained effort will be taken by Cancare Foundation in carrying this further with all the necessary commitment that it already possesses.&#8221;(This talk took place a day before their jugalbandhi in Chennai this past week.)(sivakumar2004@gmail.com)
