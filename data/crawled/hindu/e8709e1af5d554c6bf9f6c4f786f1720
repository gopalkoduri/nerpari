VCarnatic vocalist S. Venumadhav seems to be a hot name now in the realm of devotional music and also in Carnatic concert circles. His strength is his voice and his ability to render with perfect intonation and sahitya expression. He is proving to be a dedicated and highly talented young musician. The audience attend in huge numbers to listen to him.He was the natural choice for Sujanaranjani, who, for a change, held a programme at Thyagaraya Ganasabha. He was accompanied by Ramaraju Dinakar on the violin, T. P. Balasubrahmanyam on the mridangam, B. Janardan on the ghatam, Gunaranjan on the tabla and Challa Maruthi Kiran on the keyboard.Being a composer too, Venumadhav chose some fresh numbers of Annamacharya that were not sung so far by any musician, understanding the need of the audience to listen to more Annamacharya kirtanas. Out of the 12,000 available compositions of Annamacharya, hardly 1500 compositions came into circulation, including TTD&#8217;s efforts to enrol more and more singers to undertake the job and putting them in CDs. It is not only classical flavour that has to be rendered, but it also has to be meaningful with perfect expression ofsahitya. Venumadhav meets that demand, say many organisers.Venumadhav set in his repertoire into a folder and distributed these to the audience, enabling them to follow every word of the vocalist&#8217;s rendition and its raga and tala in which the composition is set.In addition, thetatparyam(gist) of each kirtana was also published underneath each of the kirtanas.They also provided a knowledgeable commentator, G. B. Sankara Rao, to go into the details of these kirtanas and narrate their philosophic import.He gave a traditional opening with a Nata raga kirtana,Paripoorna Garudadri Panchananam, that a senior musician, D. Pasupathi, set to music. This was in Sanskrit. From then on, Venumadhav rendered his own musical compositions that began withIha Para Sadhana Meethalapuin raga Bilahari that explains the traits of a true bhakta.The next composition wasAdi Naayaparadhamidi Nee Yaparadhamidiin a rare raga, Vitapi, that exhorts the humans that God is omnipotent and omnipresent.Maruni Nagari Danda Maa Illerugavain Kalyani,Sanke Lleka Talachina Jaanalakuin Bhairavi and&#8217;Singaarala Minchi Narasimha Devudu&#8217; in Nasika Bhushani were some of the well rendered pieces. The last two numbers, that of Annamayya&#8217;s son, Peda Tirumalayya (Yekkadi Mayamrugamela Temmantiin Madhuvanthi), and of Annamayya&#8217;s grandson China Tirumalacharya (Nooravaddu Thaagavaddu, Noru Chedu Gaavadduin Suddha Saveri) were also part of this repertoire.
