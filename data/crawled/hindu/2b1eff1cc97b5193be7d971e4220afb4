VCOMMEMORATING THE 178th `vardhanthi' of Syama Sastry, the Tyagaraja Aradhana Trust organised a concert in Kalabharathi recently. The absorbing recital of Sastry's select compositions by V. Mukunda Sarma, with excellent support by N.C. Madhav on violin and Dhanwada Dharma Rao on mridangam (both Akashvani staffers),  was a fitting tribute to the memory of the 18th century `vaggeyakara'.Starting on a soulful note with the `Begadavarnam Dayanidhe', Sarma, (programme executive of the local Akashvani studio) struck  a serene rhythm, rendering the Bhairavi Swarajathi Kamakshi delightfully with all the beautiful nuances of the raga and `laya bhavams' intricately embedded in the structure. This was followed by the popular `Kalyani Keerthana Himadrisuthe'. The vocalist continued his concert with the same tenor elaborating `Sankarisankuru Chandramukhi' (Saveri). Going with the flow, he then  tried out `Brovamamma' (Manzi, one of the `apoorva ragas'), `Ninuvinamarigalade' (Reethigoula), adorned with enthralling `alapana' and `swaram' and `Ninuvinamaridikkevaramma' (Poorvikalyani), more elaborately embellished with `neravu' as well. A very expressive rendition of the popular `Punnagavarali krithi Kanakasailaviharini', in the most appropriate tempo, marked the grand finale.The equally scholarly N.C. Madhav andDhanwada who executed a knowledgeable and tilting `thani',  lent excellent support in the show.A.R.S.Bottom Template Starts
