VWhile stating that he was paying his tribute to Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru and Ustad Bismillah Khan, sarod maestro Ustad Amjad Ali Khan began his concert with the universal tune "Hum Honge Qamyab...." and concluded with "Vaishnava Jana To" and "Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram". This was the place where he had come earlier with Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Saheb and played sarod here for the first time in 1963 with tabla wizard Pandit Kishan Maharaj. The tabla maestro too was witnessing this programme here in Varanasi.He touched the basic sentiments of raga Shivaranjani with grace and ended with tender vistar. Maru Vihag emerged in a different mood. Tabla accompaniment by Rashid Mustafa Khan (nephew of Ustad Ahmad Jan Thirakwa) and Shubh Maharaj (grandson of Pandit Kishan Maharaj) was nice.ProfoundAt about the same time, in a different concert organised by Sangit Parishad here at Nagri Natak Mandal, Kaushiki Chakraborty, daughter of Pandit Ajoy Chakraborty, presented raga Maru Vihag profoundly and enthralled the audience.The rare voice quality made it an unforgettable evening. Ujjwal Bharati, disciple of Kumar Bose accompanied her on the tabla well, but Parthasarthi Desicon, another disciple of Ajoy Chakraborty, did not leave much of an impression.Her selected bandishes for Maru Vihag were also rare.In vilambit, it was `Dekhe Bina Nahi Chian', and in drut, it was `Bairan Bhayi Hamari Ratiyan'. Finally she presented a thumri, `Batiyan Banake Ratiyan Kini Bhor.'GAUTAM CHATTERJEEBottom Template Starts
