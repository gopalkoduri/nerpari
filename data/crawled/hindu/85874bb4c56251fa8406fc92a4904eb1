VSur Sangeeth Pratishtana, Mysore, conducted three concerts in memory of the tabla maestro K.S. Hadpad. Invocatory song by two very young singers, Hamsini and Sukanya made deep impressions: keen sense of shruthi, progressions accurately set to rhythm, fine vocal inflections, and all these wrapped in an profound involvement. A short concert by Ramesh Kumar Kolakunda followed, revealing ardently built up style strengthened by an evolving scholarship. His voice is gentle, but stentorian in the higher octaves. A.L. Desai (harmonium) and Santhosh Kumar Nandaragi (tabala) accompanied him.Durga, which he selected for detailed exposition, comprised all the major ingredients: sargams and taans developed imaginatively; yet, the former section could have been desirably simple, and the latter more composed, for an outcome- pleasing and emotive. The concert included another number, &#8220;Ni Enage&#8221; (Puttaraja Gawai) in reverence to Panchakshari Gawai.In spite of the fact that the tabla duet (that followed) by Ravindra Yavagal and Kiran Yavagal (harmonium by Shravanakumar Potdar) was decked with resonating beats and imaginatively framed reverberating phrases, just a rhythm-accomplishment protracted for more than an hour and a quarter was not that comforting.***T.V. Shankaranarayana sang under the auspices of Nadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha. H.K. Venkataram (violin), C. Cheluvaraju (mridanga) and V.S. Ramesh (morsing) accompanied the singer. With Mahadevan Shankaranarayana lending vocal support, the concert gained substantial animation in matters of verve, virtuosity and versatility.The manner in which the veteran artiste framed the kalpanaswaras drew instant attention creating a sense of wonder: with astounding spontaneity swaras surged in cascades within the terse grip of the rhythm cycles wading through variety of interesting complexities.Nevertheless, for want of pleasing movements combined with superfluous swarakalpana, the concert left a perceptible lacuna in pleasant experience, which the competent artistes could have filled with tuneful airs, by aesthetically paring down aggressive and redundant articulations for better balance and beauty.With two exceptions (&#8220;Ee Pariya Sobagu&#8221; and &#8220;Venkatachala Nilayam&#8221;- Purandaradasa), the compositions lacked the expected clarity and serenity; the general tempo was not congenial for such fulfillment. Neraval at &#8220;Shiva Madhava Brahmadhula&#8221; (&#8220;Ethavunara&#8221;-Kalyani-Thyagaraja) was scholarly and emotive. Nevertheless, when the learned singer expanded the passage with frequent stress on &#8216;dula' of Brahmadula, his efforts failed to convey the intended import and significance. Same with Vasudevachar's &#8220;Brochevarevarura&#8221; in Khamach; it was marred by meaningless splits in lyrics like bro-cheva, nana-divandita and para-kelanayya. The melody accompanist with soft curves placed before the audience the essence of Todi (&#8220;Enduka Dayaradura&#8221; &#8211; Thyagaraja), drawing a contrast between himself and the lead singer. Yet, none of them successfully strived for an exhaustive exploration.The presentation enjoyed a neraval at the charana, Thyagaraja Vinutha, but went without any embellishment.&#8220;Mahaganapathim&#8221; (Naata-Dikshithar), &#8220;Palukavademira&#8221; (Devamanohari-Vasudevacharya- overdosed swarakalpana- considering such passages consuming the major share of the concert), &#8220;Varalakshmi Namosthute&#8221; (Gourimanohari-Vasudevacharya), &#8220;Saarasamukhi&#8221; (Goudamalhar &#8211; Muthayya Bhagavathar) were other inclusions.
