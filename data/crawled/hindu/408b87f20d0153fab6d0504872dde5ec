VPalai Ramachandran sang on the second day of J.S.S. Sangeetha Sammelana. Avanisham Vinu (violin), Arjun Kumar (mridanga) and V.S. Ramesh (morsing) accompanied.The accomplished singer was vigorous in his approach laying more emphasis on verve and rhythm than on the melodic aspects of music. This had a two-fold impact: whereas he could please an audience who favourably respond only when triggered by pounding accentuations, he disappointed a listener who likes to take refuge in the sentimental aspects of compositions and the ragas as well.Observe &#8220;Devadeva Kalayami&#8221; (Mayamalavagoula - Swathi Thirunal) in this context. Neither the diction (the lyrics in Sanskrit warranted utmost clarity) nor the speed (lyrics of this dimension expected a slow to moderate tempo) went in favour of the essence of the lyrics.Moreover, the learned artiste could have keenly considered the gravity of the meaning of the charana section, &#8220;Jaatarupa Nibhachela Janmaarjitam Mamaakhila Pathaka&#8221;, before attempting a neraval. A theme centred on absolute submission to the Lord, and reminding oneself of the afflictions accumulated over series of rebirths, verily warranted expressions: meditative and reflecting.In the above instance, the framing and execution of swaraprastara too could not complement the lyrics. On many occasions, particularly in the swaraprastara sections, the swara phrases were muddled up under the pressure of the gushing extempore &#8212; the pace and accentuations undesirable.Violinist's measured approach to the melodic aspects compensated the dearth of pleasant musical experience to an appreciable degree.Other numbers were &#8220;Gajavadhana Karunasadana&#8221; (Shriranjani-Papanasham Sivan), &#8220;Pattividuvaraadu&#8221; (Thyagaraja-Manjari), &#8220;Maanavajanma Doddadu&#8221; (Purvikalyani-Purandaradasaru), &#8220;Chetashri&#8221; (Rithigoula- Dikshitharu) and &#8220;Sharavanabhava&#8221; (Shanmukhapriya- Papanasham Sivan) constituted the rest of the concert.* * *On the inaugural day, young Rajkamal played flute, meeting all the requirements of a serious connoisseur; and his comprehensive approach to music raised him to successful heights. Charulatha Ramanujan (violin), B.C. Manjunath (mridanga) and S. Manjunath (ghata) accompanied him.The first fast number &#8220;Raghunayaka&#8221; (Hamsadhwani-Thyagaraja), with rhythmic fervour shot a momentary concern as to the nature of the general outcome: pyrotechnic. On the contrary, as he progressed, the number seemed quite relevant for an absorbing and scholarly beginning.The tenable reason for such a drastic shift in opinion is his composed approach to the compositions that followed, and which stood distinctly for grandeur and majesty.&#8220;Nannu Vidachi&#8221; (Rithigoula-Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Meenakshi Me&#8221; (Purvikalyani-Dikshitharu) displayed ample proof of his competence and taste, reinforced by refined technique.Alapana developed in progressive increments reaching melodic peaks, neraval at Madhurapuri enlivening the lyrics and swaraprastara woven with imaginative subtleties deserved genuine appreciations in Dikshitar's &#8220;Meenakshi Me&#8221;.&#8220;Innu Daya Baarade&#8221; (Kalyanavasantha-Purandaradasaru) was another inclusion: emotive and contemplative.On this valedictory function, the sabha honored K.P. Upadhyaya bestowing on him the title Sangeetha Vidhyanidhi. Sabha also recognised Chilakunda Brothers (flute), P.N. Subbaraman (Patron), Jaya Venkataram (vocalist), Lakshmikantha Kadaba (singer) and Nirajha Achyutha Rao (musician) for their yeomen contributions for the preservation of tradition for the posterity.
