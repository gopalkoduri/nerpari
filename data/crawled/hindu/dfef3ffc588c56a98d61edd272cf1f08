VMembers of the Pydah Educational Institutions and Wisezen recently organised a recital of Annamacharya compositions by Guru Kondaveeti Jyothirmayi at Kalabharathi. Jyothirmayi is the winner of a place in the Limca and Guiness Books of World Records for getting the transliterated versions of holy works like the Bible, the Quran, the Ramayana, and Mahabharatha published in Braille.She was also given an opportunity to work as a research scholar at TTD Annamacharya Project for a few years immediately after finishing postgraduate course in Carnatic music there. The passion she developed for the songs of the Sankeertanaacharya made her learn and sing them with soulful involvement. Not content, she established Annamacharya Kalapeetham at Hyderabad all by herself. She made it available especially for getting the blind, otherwise physically challenged and the destitute trained free of cost in singing the Sankeertans, also not aspiring for any financial help from outside. No wonder she was inducted as a member of the Red Cross, Animal Welfare Society and Forum for Street Children.At Kalabharathi, Jyothirmayi was excellently accompanied on the keyboard by Saikumar, tabla by Bandaru Ramanamurty, and other rhythms like pads etc. by Pavankumar and Satyendar, while Vidya, Anoohya, Suvarna and Phalakshi joined her in singing some compositions. Jyothirmayi regaled all alike in the auditorium with her singing for over two hours and made it more interesting with analytical commentaries in Telugu, not with out an occasional mix-up of English words before each one of them.Vinaro Bhagyamu Vishnukatha, Ramudeethadu &#8211; Lokaabhi Ramudeethadu, Vichcheyavamma Vennela Bomma and a few more of the like set to tune and rendered with classical touch attracted loud applause.One of the members on the teaching staff of the Pydah institutions, M.V. Rajasekhar, presented the welcome address and vote of thanks.
