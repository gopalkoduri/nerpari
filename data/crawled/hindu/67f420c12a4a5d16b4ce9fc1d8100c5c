VIt was indeed a great delight to attend the  sitar recital of young Prateek Choudhury, son and disciple of the sitar maestro Pandit Debobrat Choudhury. The well-known raga Miyan-ki-Malhar, an immortal creation of Miyan Tansen,  was handled brilliantl\u000ay  by Prateek. The recital was held in memory of the late tabla maestro Pandit Hiralal and presented by the Delhi Tabla Vikas Parishad.With this recital, Prateek proved he is  becoming a  mature musician,  not exhibiting any  signs of  haste, restlessness and showmanship, evident in his earlier days. Prateek&#8217;s  alap-jod-jhala, taken at length, was a delight to listen to since he was playing with intense reposefulness and a calm mental attitude. A slight touch of the note Shuddha Madhyam, while traversing from Komal Gandhar to Shuddha Rishab, would have added further charm to his recital.There were several traces of the mannerism and the technique of hisdada-guru, the late Ustad Mushtaq Ali Khan, a scion of  Jaipur&#8217;s Maseetkhani gharana. One understands that Prateek also  received some talim from the legendar\u000ay ustad.One very much appreciated Prateek&#8217;s handling of  Miyan-ki-Malhar, which is the most popular melody among more than a dozen varieties of Malhars. His note-by-note elaboration was done in a very leisurely manner. Yet it kept  listeners fully responsive to his recital. The raga&#8217;s sthayee-antara was executed with a good understanding of the raga&#8217;s unique format.Equally delightful were his execution of the slow 16-beat Maseetkhani gat-todas with spontaneously improvised variations. He displayed a good command over the rhythm provided by the young tabla player Rafiuddin Sabri. There were a  number of occasions when the duo drew accolades from the audience. The sitar recital was performed in the good old Maseetkhani tradition.The fast Teen tala gat-todas (there were two of these) were done with much aplomb. There were plenty of  sequences as posers and retorts between the two which were at times  breathtaking. Prateek&#8217;s  powerful gamaks and sweeping sapaat-taans were executed in a neat and confident manner, thereby indicating his maturity in playing.
