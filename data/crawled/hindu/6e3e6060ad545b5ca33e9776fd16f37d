VIt is  pleasing to note that Swarna Rethas is improving  with every concert and qualifying himself as an accomplished artist. His vocal recital in memory of Mythili Krishnaswami, founder of Raga Tarangini, at Dakshinamurthy Auditorium, testified this point.Starting with the dainty varnam &#8216;Saranagatha Vatsale&#8217; in Kathanakuthoohalam (Calcutta Krishnamurthy), Rethas directly went to the vivacious &#8216;Dinamani Vamsa&#8217; unleashing swaras like a thundershower.The sangatis rolled dazzlingly in the anupallavi and the swaras surged forth energetically. This energy was maintained throughout the concert.The raga interpretations of Dharmavati and Thodi were illustrative of Swarna Rethas&#8217; inclination to build the raga imagery with an ingenious, involved and invigorating approach. The two important aspects of Carnatic music, raga alapana and swara proyaga, were presented with focus and forethought. The open mouthed, well modulated articulation is a great advantage to him.&#8216;Arulvai Angayarkanni&#8217; of Dandapani Desikar in Dharmavati was poignant, and niraval was on the phrase &#8216;Unmai Uyargunangal Ellam&#8217; with  swarakalpana alternating with three notes, converging neatly into the finale.Touching the vital raga phrases in Thodi through a cluster of pauses  punctuated with brigas, Rethas drew a stately image for the raga.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Kaddhanu Variki&#8217; with its cascading sangatis moved on with a beguiling gait. The paucity of time did not allow Rethas the luxury of niraval and therefore, he pitched on swaras at &#8216;Niddhura Nirakaranichi&#8217;. Once again, his skill to wax eloquently on swaras with varying rhythm and wane them to the finality, surfaced effectively.There were not too many items in the two-hour concert; a sedate &#8216;Cheta Sribalakrishnam&#8217; in Dwijawanti (Dikshitar) in the first part, &#8216;Neethan Thunai Neelamabari&#8217;, a colourful ragamalika (N.S. Chidambaram) and a thillana as the tail piece, were creditable inclusions.The rest of the team was an accomplished one; V. Sanjeev on the violin is known for his pristine pure raga expositions and purveying swara responses that match with the main artist.Sanjeev&#8217;s raga explorations of Dharmavati and Thodi stood out in its subtlety to the dynamism of Swarna Retha&#8217;s vocals.Ganapathy Raman and Guruprasad on mridangam and ghatam respectively, made a lively duo from the start to the end, and their crispy tani was enjoyable for its brevity.
