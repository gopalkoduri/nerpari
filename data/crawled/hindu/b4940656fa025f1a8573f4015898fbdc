VThe changing profile of Indian Music&#8217; was the focus at the annual ITC Sangeet Research Academy (SRA) seminar, organised by the Music Forum and the National Centre of Performing Arts in Mumbai recently.  Scholars from across the world and musicians discussed the issue in depth. The seminar papers, the discussions and panel sessions, covered experiments with tradition, the cross-over culture and music education in the globalised world.The theme papers were presented by Dr. Ashok Ranade and Professor Wim van der Meer, associate professor, University of Amsterdam, in the inaugural session.  Ranade said that the river of Indian Music comprises many tributaries. Indian musicians are performing for non-Indian audiences and are collaborating with musicians abroad. The fusion, he said is &#8216;Sangam-Sangeet&#8217; and the legitimacy of the effort should be taken seriously. He also talked about preparing true listeners, because there is an more emphasis on the visualthan the aural perception. He emphasised that music is all about evolution . Evaluating evolution,  Wim van der Meer, a dedicated disciple of the late Pandit Dilip Chandra Bedi, quoted his guru who said, &#8220;there is a lot of noise today.&#8221; It is truer in the present day scenario.The crossover experiments were discussed from both Indian and Western perspectives. Panellists for the Indian perspective were Trilok Gurtu, Shankar Mahadevan, Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, Trichy Shankaran, professor of music at York University, Canada, and Ken Zukerman, sarod player and director of Ali Akbar Khan College of Music, Switzerland. The moderators were Pandit Arvind Parikh and  Ranade. All the panellists felt  that crossovers were not a threat to tradition but enrich it. Trilok was brilliant in his exposition. He shared how being an Indian musician came handy whenever he was challenged with the intricacies of rhythm while experimenting with musicians of different origins and nationalities. &#8220;Do it with understanding, and enjoy the crossover,&#8221; he said. They all agreed that the fundamentals of &#8216;sur&#8217; and &#8216;laya&#8217; should be perfect before one tries fusion.Professor Joep Bor from Rotterdam moderated the Western perspective of the crossover experiments, and the panellists  included Rokus de Groot from Amsterdam and  Frans de Ruiter from Leiden University among others . They felt that crossover was a huge area with different approaches and shared their various experiments with Indian and foreign musicians.Experiments within the tradition also had Western and Indian performers sharing their views.  Adrien McNeil from Sydney, Ken Zukerman from Switzerland and cellist Saskia Rao from Delhi  spoke on the Western music tradition, while  Arvind Parikh (sitar), Vijay Kichlu (associated with Agra gayaki),  Dhrupad vocalists Ramakant and Umakant Gundecha,  Sudhamahi Raghunathan, Carnatic vocalist, and chitra veena player Ravi Kiran represented the Indian music tradition. There were also segments on  folk, pop and film music. The popularity of music education on the Web and distance guidance and training were also discussed during a session on &#8216;music education in the globalised world.&#8217;The changing profile of Indian music has not only brought more awareness about  other cultures but also made performers and composers open to ideas, observed David Trassof from California.
