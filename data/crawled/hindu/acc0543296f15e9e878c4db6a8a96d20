VAs I approach the Open Air Theatre at Kalakshetra, where  Svanubhava was inaugurated, I find a group of students from the Music Academy Music College, discussing the morning session. S. Lalitha says that she found the question&#8211;answer session ve\u000ary useful. &#8220;Vijay Siva explained that a raga should not be a swara based construction, but that we should understand the swarupam, the bhava of the raga. He said Semmangudi mama had emphasised this. We have not had the opportunity to interact with mama. Thanks to Svanubhava, at least we got to talk to someone who has. We think Svanaubhava is in that sense a bridge that links the past and the future.&#8221; S.G.Priya, Manimozhi, Gnanambigai and Shyamala, all students from the Government Music College, agree.Santhoshkumar and J.Kannan are studying music in Chennai, but are from Cuddalore. They wish YACM would organise similar programmes in places such as Cuddalore.  Another group is in a hurry to catch  Neyveli Santhanagopalan delivering a lecture on &#8220;Major Ragas handled by legends.&#8221;The veteran does not disappoint them. He demonstrates the Ariyakkudi, GNB and Madurai Mani Iyer styles of singing Thodi, Khambodi and Sankarabharanam. Audio snatches  are played.  &#8220;Ariyakkudi&#8217;s Thodi was special. He was never given to excess. He always gave the essence of a raga crisply. Please listen to this recording. Notice how he always sang with akhara suddham,&#8221; points out Santhanagopalan. &#8220;Whenever Ariyakkudi sang &#8216;Sri Subramanyaya&#8217; (Khambodi), his niraval at &#8216;Vaasavaadi&#8217; would be  eagerly awaited. Once despite a sore throat, Ariyakkudi touched mel panchamam, when singing &#8216;Vaasavaadi,&#8221; he adds.Santhanagopalan clarifies that he has included only three legends, because he hasn&#8217;t yet learnt to demo the styles of the others!He explains why we refer to Ariyakkudi, TNR, Musiri and many others as legends. &#8220;There was, in their music, consistency, depth of truth, originality, uncompromising presentation, elegance,  entertainment  and grace. And of course they were all trendsetters.&#8221;Through his lecture that was witty as well as instructive, Santhanagopalan captivated the audience.As T.M.Krishna summed up, &#8220;What we heard are not mere imitations. They are proof that Santhanagopalan has internalised the music of the veterans.&#8221;Aymeric, from France, is a third year student of music in Kalakshetra. He says he liked the lecture, because it was in tune with the needs of students.Sriram, a class eight student from Bharatiya Vidyalaya, is learning the violin. He says, &#8220;I had never heard of Ariyakkudi before.  Now after listening to this lecture, and to the recordings of Ariyakkudi that were played, I want to listen to more of his music.&#8221;And that shouldn&#8217;t be difficult, because as Santhanagopalan said,  music is just a click away.
