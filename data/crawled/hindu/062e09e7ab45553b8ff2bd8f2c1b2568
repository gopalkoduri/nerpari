VThe recently released compact disc of the Maharajapuram lineage by Srishti&#8217;s Carnatica contains a part of a live concert of Maharajapuram Srinivasan and his son Maharajapuram Ganesh Viswanathan. The names of the accompanying artistes do not find a mention in the inlay card.The disc opens with Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s samashti charanam krithi &#8216;Sri Rama Saraswathi&#8217; in Nasamani a vivadhi raga. Nasamani is known as Nasikabhooshani in the sampoorna paddhati. This composition in praise of Goddess Lalithambika is sung with a clear understanding of the vivadhi swaras. The vocalists have presented an alapana of Thodi, which initially is a healthy dissertation anchored by phrases which are meaningful. This later on  becomes a sawal jawab exercise between the singers. The phrases sung by Srinivasan are duplicated by Ganesh, leaving no room for the violinist to follow the main singer.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Dasukovalena&#8217; in Misra Jampa is sung adhering to a good patanthara. The violinist responds to these exercises confidently. The mridangist plays an appropriate and crisp thani avarthanam for the tala cycle of 10 beats.Mannargudi Sambasiva Bhagavathar&#8217;s Maand creation, &#8216;Neerajadalanayana,&#8217; which was a favourite with Maharajapuram Santhanam is sung joyously. It is praiseworthy that Srinivasan concludes the pallavi, anupallavi and charanam of this song as &#8216;Neeraja&#8217; instead of just &#8216;Ni&#8217; as sung by many, conveying the meaning &#8212; lotus.Maharajapuram SrinivasanSrishti&#8217;s Carnatica, Chennai.MRP Rs. 125
