VMany still think of the United States as being &#8216;Second Rate&#8217; when it comes to the arts in general and to music in particular. While in the 19th  century this was perhaps  true, that&#8217;s not been the case for a long time. And it is especially untrue when considering the major original musical contribution the United States has made to the world, Jazz.An expression of vitality, longing, exultation and every other emotion music expresses, born from a mixture of African songs of work, love, faith and protest, early American Protestant hymnody, European folk songs as they were transplanted in American soil, and from the stuff of every day experience of the common person, especially the common African American transplanted at first unwillingly to a new land.This past Wednesday evening at Mowbray&#8217;s Hall in the Sheraton Park Hotel, Jazz Pianist Madhav Chari gave invited guests a solo recital he had originally wanted to call &#8216;The Great American Songbook.&#8217; He had intended to play popular &#8220;Standards&#8221; in his own style, but due to a last-minute legal issue concerning copyright, he was forbidden to play any melodies not his own that are still in copyright. So, instead he chose swiftly and effortlessly to interpret the concert&#8217;s title as his personal take on &#8216;Great American Song&#8217; generally, in seven compositions of his own.After brief warm and enthusiastic opening remarks from Raja M. Kausalya Devi, the Honorary French Consul in Chennai, and Andrew Simsen, the United States Consul General, the concert opened with a Blues number entitled &#8216;Blues for Crescent City,&#8217; in homage to New Orleans, where Jazz began, but with a twist that proved to be a link between all of the pieces in the programme &#8212; a very tricky-to-hear and difficult-to-execute left hand rhythmic style that one almost thought of as impossible for a person physically to execute, but instead only possible for a mechanical &#8220;player piano&#8221; not unlike the astonishing effect created in the American composer Conlon Nancarrow&#8217;s music in the mid 20th century. Throughout the concert, Madhav&#8217;s technique at times approached the complexity of Nancarrow&#8217;s mechanically produced rhythms and rapid melodies, leaving  the attentive listener breathless.It&#8217;s a famous form, but the Tango is known as a South American musical style rather than a North American one. But as Madhav pointed out, its most common rhythms are used widely in Jazz. To demonstrate this he played us his &#8216;Tango Sentimentale.&#8217; The piece was dedicated to W.C. Handy, the first American Jazz musician, and to Astor Piazzollathe famous Argentine Tango composer.The trouble with copyright was an understandable thread throughout the evening. As a wry comment on what &#8220;original copyrighted music&#8221; means in terms of Jazz, Madhav played a piece he called &#8216;Standard-ology.&#8217; In Jazz and popular music parlance, a &#8220;Standard&#8221; is any well-known tune a competent commercial musician will know and have ready to perform at the drop of a hat. But, as Madhav pointed out, the harmony of many Standards is almost identical, and only the melody changes from piece to piece. So, without playing a particular &#8220;Standard&#8221; (which would have been technically illegal that night), his &#8216;Standard-ology&#8217; was exactly that: a study in the harmony common to many famous (copyrighted) pieces, yet totally legal in the context of the evening&#8217;s performance because no specific Standard was named.Madhav has recorded a new CD on the EMI label, &#8216;Parisian Thoroughfares,&#8217; which consists mostly of his own copyrighted compositions and is currently available at Landmark. &#8216;Rejoice&#8217; was an item from this CD taking as its point of departure and return the American Black Gospel tradition. It was thoroughly engaging and brought to my mind the African American Church&#8217;s musical tradition in a wholly fresh way. But perhaps the most interesting item of the evening was a piece he called &#8216;A Search.&#8217; This is a new piece, and hints for Madhav, and for us, at several new found freedoms of technique and style which we should look forward to hearing more of in the further development of Madhav&#8217;s music. The last piece on the programme was &#8216;Swinging the Blues,&#8217; a rousing number that brought us, in an often extroverted and flamboyant manner, to where the concert began.There was happily an encore, a further original piece by Madhav called &#8216;Evening Serenade.&#8217; This was the item on the programme which most nearly, in this listener&#8217;s mind, reflected the original title of the concert, &#8216;The Great American Songbook.&#8217; It was the simplest and most memorable piece on the programme in terms of its melody, and a talented lyricist could ensure a bright career from setting words to such a comfortable, memorable tune and relaxed piano style.Madhav Chari&#8217;s passion lies in exploring and refining his own understanding of Jazz.  He is thus not interested in creating &#8220;fusion&#8221; music as so many popular Indian musicians are doing these days. For Jazz to take root in Indian soil and become imbued with what India has to offer, as one day it will, we first need examples created here of &#8220;the real thing&#8221;. I&#8217;m here to tell you: Madhav&#8217;s playing is the Real Thing. Some think it too closely follows its American models. I&#8217;m not bothered by that. Other Jazz musicians here in India who will come after him will make contributions some of which will lend an Indian edge and ethos to the form, but they&#8217;ll have in large part Madhav Chari to thank for whatever they may accomplish.Madhav&#8217;s new CD will provide those not lucky enough to get an invitation to Wednesday&#8217;s event to experience this prodigious talent, who is working here in our own back yard.  I for one look forward to an occasion when Madhav Chari makes an appearance on a more proletarian stage in Chennai,  where a wider public are able to and should go to hear this remarkable talent.
