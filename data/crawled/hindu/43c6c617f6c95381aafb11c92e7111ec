VSri Saraswathi Gana Kala Shaale presented Layanada-Taranga-Antaranga, pre-eminently a rhythm-extravaganza, in memory of asthana mridanga vidwan M.R. Rajappa, an illustrious name in the art of percussion, who had won accolades from musicians of high rank and repute.The evening started with devotional songs, as a prelude to the main event, by the members of Snehabharati Sthri Samaja. They presented the songs with involvement. &#8220;Gananathaya Namaste&#8221; (Gowla), &#8220;Manimaya Bhushini&#8221; (Hamsadhwani), &#8220;Parvathisha Papanasha&#8221; (Udayaravichandrike), &#8220;Iko Nodu Ranganathana&#8221; (Brindavani-Purandaradasa) and such other compositions gave an impetus to the show.A short programme, yet worth mentioning, was the tani avarthana by very young artistes - Lakshmisha, Lochana and Anup. In them, artistry now in its inception has revealed every sign of evolvement on the verge of maturity in commensurate with their age and exposure.On the occasion, the school honoured veteran percussionist, Nagabhushanachar (mridanga) in recognition of his significant role in contributing to the field.The main event: M.R. Hanumantharaju, a much sought after percussionist, and R.S. Nandakumar, one of the young vocalists in the frontline, have jointly directed the musical compositions. There was a melodic flavour as well as a rhythm fervour in them; the overall planning taking its shape on a traditional platform, any conventional concert ideally expected to take.As a collective result, the rhythm show, by virtue of inclusion of lyrics (sung by Nandakumar), provided sufficient weight to concrete sentiments, as opposed to abstract perception, if it were merely an event of mere instrumental assemblage. A few passages of Western music crowned the show.In Patnam's varna, &#8220;Evaribodha&#8221; (Abhogi), Nandakumar's rich voice and energetic progressions, thoroughly blended with the vivacity of the orchestration; and the virile raga chosen for the purpose suited the sophistication. Some of the artistes seasoned in the Police Band heightened the impact of the special effects expected of such orchestration. The number of participants amounted to 15 and their age ranged from 12 to sixty.&#8220;Vathapi Ganapathim&#8221; (Hamsadhwani-Dikshithar), &#8220;Endaro Mahanubhavulu&#8221; (Shri - Thyagaraja) entertained the audience, finally leading them to enjoy and appreciate the focus, Thyagaraja's &#8220;Saamajavaragamana&#8221; (Hindola). The singer liberally shaded the alapana with fine touches of Hindustani style impressing the audience instantly.Maybe, inclusion of a few strains of thana-s would have enhanced the general effect, considering the resonance and virility of the singer's voice and the availability of numerous rhythm instruments in the readiness to join and complement such special vocal inflections. An elaborate swaraprastara, led by the singer, was a mixture of merits (in the form of fluent and inspiring manodharma), and shortcomings (in the form of frequent vacillations with respect to shruthi).Melody accompaniments: violin (Shanthakumar), flute (Padmanabh), veena ( Mohankumar), clarinet (Jayaram), mandolin (Karthik), rhythm guitar (Vincent), main guitar (Mason), western violin (Manu) and keyboard (Manu and Vijaykumar).Rhythm accompaniments: mridanga (M.R. Hanumantharaju), tabla (Jayaram and Manjunath), ghata (M.R. Chandrashekhar), morsing (Dasappa), khanjira (Shrikanth) and rhythm pad (Lakshmisha and Shivakumar).
