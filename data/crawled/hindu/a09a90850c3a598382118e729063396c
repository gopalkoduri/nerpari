VPushpa Kashinath presented\u000aveena recital at\u000aGanabharathi, Mysore,\u000aaccompanied by\u000aG.S. Ramanujam (mridanga)\u000aand M.R. Manjunath\u000a(ghata).Throughout the concert,\u000ashe maintained uniform\u000amelodic tempo and set a\u000apicture, bright and lively.\u000aSomehow, it was also felt\u000athat most of the passages\u000adenoted premeditated measures,\u000amarginally overshadowing\u000aspontaneity.Her control over the instrument\u000aleft no doubt\u000aabout her dedicated practice,\u000awhich would not allow\u000aany wrong notes to infiltrate\u000ainto the passages, irrespective\u000aof the pace she\u000aselected for her expressions.\u000aAttractively knit\u000aphrases complemented by\u000afine graces, made her concert\u000apleasing. In addition,\u000aher control over plucking\u000arendered it inspiring.Such merits favourably\u000ainfluenced compositions\u000alike "Lambodaram Avalambe"\u000a(Kamboji - Mysore\u000aVasudevacharya), "Shri\u000aSwaminathaya" (Khamach\u000a- Muddusvami Dikshithar)\u000aand "Etijanmamidi" (Varali\u000a- Thyagaraja - an elaborate\u000aalapana preceding the lyrics\u000anot appended with passages\u000aof neraval or swarakalpana,\u000aleft a mark of imbalance).Short to moderately lengthy\u000aalapana-s introduced\u000athese lyrics, and the method\u000aof developing them comprised\u000aattractive passages\u000aappeared to have pre-designed\u000aonly to be connected\u000ain different combinations\u000afor glittering impact. Judiciously\u000aemployed tribhinna\u000agamaka-s in\u000acombination with liberal\u000ausage of mandra sancharas\u000aaggrandised the special effects.Dramatic climaxes featured\u000araga-tana-pallavi in\u000aBhairavi ("Kanchi Kamakshi"),\u000awhich culminated\u000ain vigorous tani\u000aavarthana by the percussionists.\u000a***On the second day, Trichur\u000aRamachandran sang, accompanied\u000aby Mysore\u000aNagaraj (violin), B. Ravishankar\u000a(mridanga) and S.\u000aManjunath (ghata).The veteran, with astounding\u000averve and the\u000aswiftness kept the audience\u000aspellbound. Nevertheless,\u000ascholarship\u000aovertook melodic experiences.\u000aThis was particularly\u000aso when compositions\u000alike "Marivere Dikkevaru\u000aRamayya" (Latangi-Patnam\u000aSubrahmanya Iyer)\u000aand "Brochevarevarura"\u000a(Khamach-Vasudevacharya)\u000awere considered.Lyrical import, especially\u000ain Patnam's kriti demands\u000aa tone that is\u000asupplicating; and the raga\u000aLathangi that embodies\u000apensive mood warrants a\u000adelicate approach. In the\u000apresent instance, the\u000alearned artiste took recourse\u000ain technically establishing\u000athe presentation\u000athan transforming into an\u000aabsorbing musical piece.The pattern of swarakalpana\u000aafter an elaborate neraval\u000aat the pallavi did not\u000aconform to the plaintive\u000amood, and to the contrary,\u000atrod a very different path\u000aof complexity and pyrotechnic.\u000aThough the lyrical\u000asections of "Brochevarevarura"\u000astood for the clarity\u000aand expected\u000asentiments, the swaraprastara\u000asections followed the\u000asame pattern as the previous\u000amentioned one. Ragatana\u000aand pallavi mainly in\u000aTodi featured many strains\u000atruly absorbing, particularly\u000awhile he was expanding\u000athe raga appending it with\u000ainspiring thana-s, developed\u000ain different stages,\u000aevery step closely and meticulously\u000acomplemented\u000aby the melody accompanist.Strangely, the pallavi\u000asection, "Thathadhimitha\u000adhidhiyani sadhashivudadenu",\u000aalmost passed without\u000aleaving significant trail,\u000aa pallavi expatiation expected.\u000aCompetence\u000adawned in the swarakalpana\u000asections which\u000apassed through Shahana,\u000aBhowli and Behag, later to\u000afeature an interesting tani\u000aavarthana."Teliyaleru Rama" (Dhenuka\u000a- Thyagaraja), "Ranjani\u000aNiranjani" (Ranjani -\u000aGNB), "Radhasametha\u000aKrishna" (Yaman - Anai\u000aVaidyanatha Iyer) and\u000a"Dharma Shravanavidetake"\u000a(Durga - Purandaradasa)\u000aconstituted other\u000anumbers.
