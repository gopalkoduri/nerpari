VMandolin artiste U. Rajesh presented a recital during the re-release function of his CD titled &#8216;Into the Light.&#8217; The artiste explained that the album had been released by &#8216;Music Today&#8217; a few years ago, but intervening circumst\u000aances had called for a re-release. His co-artistes for the evening included his collaborator on the album, pianist Anil Srinivasan (keyboard), Thanjavur Murugabhoopathy (mridangam), T.H.Vinayak ram (ghatam) and Murali (drums). The event was organised by &#8216;Music Today&#8217; and sponsored by the fuel brand &#8216;Power.&#8217; The brief presentation focused on highlighting elements of melody and rhythm, representative of the Carnatic idiom, within a framework that allowed for the blending of western instrumental music without intruding on either sensibility. As a result, the programme had its bright spots in the projection of kriti structure, sangatis and sahitya bhava thankfully intact, unmarred by any pseudo-innovative touches. The exposition of Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Annapoorne&#8217; was a case in point, the soothing strains of Sama flowing along familiar lines. The piece introduced as &#8216;Three Changes&#8217; involved a foray into three ragas beginning with and reverting to the main motif in Simhendramadhyamam. The lead-up, not strictly classifiable as a traditional alapana, employed jazz-friendly vocabulary with whizzing three-octave trajectories, undulating wave pattern effects and flamboyant flourishes that focused on exploiting range and instrumental technique.On the return curve, there were a few reflective moments in phrasing before the inevitable build-up towards the beat-driven crescendo took over. This segment (Adi, 1kalai) evolved in the sawal-jawab format with the mandolin leading and ghatam and mridangam responding. The experienced hand of seasoned artistes at the helm drew the line at the venture going overboard.Anil Srinivasan&#8217;s contribution included a soft melodious prelude in the introductory piece. &#8216;Vikku&#8217; Vinayakram&#8217;s presence ensured that audience participation was a given at the tail end of the tani avartanam, with the ghatam maestro urging rasikas to join in with claps during his trademark tattoo in the single, half and quarter-avartana interludes. Mridangam artiste Thanjavur Murugabhoopathy garnered his share of the applause by deftly juggling nadais as did Murali who drummed up a storm during the exchanges.
