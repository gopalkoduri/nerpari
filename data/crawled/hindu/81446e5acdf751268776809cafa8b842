VB. RAMADEVIA totally relaxed Ganesha comfortably reclining on a pillow, enjoying the performance of four other Ganeshas on the veena, flute, mridangam and the cymbal, was presiding over Rajalakshmi Fine Arts' September Season 2006. This was the backdrop at Nani Kalaiarangam, Coimbatore.Divyatha Arun, a  doctor and disciple of K.J. Sarasa, made an auspicious beginning with her Bharatanatyam recital. Under the competent guidance of her guru, who wielded the cymbals that day, Divyatha displayed her devotion towards dance despite having chosen an equally exacting field of studies.After Sokkeswarar Kauthuvam, she presented the Anandabhairavi varnam on Rajagopala with perfect abhinaya and footwork.In `Theruvil Vaaraano, Ennaiththirumbi Paaraano' and `Podhu Pogudhillaiye Enakkoru Thoodhu Selvaar Illaiye' she was the love-lorn nayika, yearning for  her lord.By the time she began `Enneramum Undhan Sannithiyile Naan Irukkavendum Aiyaa,' her love for the lord matured into devotion and total surrender.The tillana in Poornachandrika was brisk and pleasing. Girija Ramaswamy's vocal support was a great asset. Muruganandam on the violin and Viswanathan on the mridangam made the orchestra wholesome.Rare kritisStaunch adherence to tradition marked the first music programme of the season by R. Vedavalli.  She presented some of the rarely heard kritis on the deities in and around Thanjavur  as her theme was `Thanjai'. `Viriboni,' the varnam in Bhairavi, and `Sri Rajagopala' in Saveri were on the Lord of Mannargudi.Beginning with `Vatapi Ganapathim Bhaje' in Hamsadwani (Thiruvarur),   she sang many kritis by various composers, though the lion's share was given to Muthuswami Dikshitar.The accompanying artistes R.K.Sriram Kumar (violin), N. Manoj Siva (mridangam), and S. Karthick (ghatam), exercised great control as a mark of reverence to the vocalist.The vocal recital of Ranjani and Gayatri the following day was a study in contrast. The young and talented sisters cast a spell over the audience with their overwhelming energy and tempo.They made sure that the audience sat through the `thani' by completing the main item in half the time and had plenty of time for the RTP in Gowri Manohari with the `dwinadai' pallavi (two different nadais for its two parts) `Velane Siva Balane Kaththarula Tharunamithu', set to chatusra jathi triputa talam.Chakravakam and Surutti were presented elaborately for the songs `Sugunamule' by Tyagaraja and `Sri Venkata Gireesham' by Dikshitar respectively. Violinist Sriram Kumar excelled in raga delineations.The ragamalika viruttam, `Ninrum Irunthum Kidanthum' followed by `Karunai Deivame' in Sindhubhairavi was exquisite.The bhajan in raag Lalit, the abhang in Maru Behag by Sant Gnaneswar and `Muddugare Yasodha' by Annamacharya were in place, gratifying the expectation of the audience.Gayatri's voice soared   as the percussionists' fingers (Arun Prakash-mridangam and Guruprasad-ghatam) danced on their chosen instruments.Bottom Template Starts
