VIs there a better way of presenting  Muthuswamy Dikshitar&#8217;s Abhayamba Vibhakti kritis in vocal with the strong support of the veena? After all, the illustrious composer himself was an exponent of the veena and all his compositions were replete \u000awith &#8216;gamakam,&#8217; a speciality  of Carnatic music and the veena.Those who attended the intellectually rich and modestly presented programme by veena vidushi Kalpagam Swaminathan and her disciples would have definitely carried home the satisfaction of listening to  blissful music with inspiring explanations.Dikshitar&#8217;s compositions  are characterised by their exacting but elegant structure and intense connotation with high literary, aesthetic and musical values. Abhayamba Navavaranam is a series  of ten kritis in praise of the deity of Mayuram (Mayiladuthurai).  Every composition was prefaced by a brief but informative commentary by Sivasri Gopalakrishnan.After the invocation numbers on Ganesha (&#8216;Maha ganapathim&#8217; in Thodi) and Subrahmanya (&#8216;Subrahmanyena&#8217; in Suddha Dhanyasi), the &#8216;Dyanam&#8217; kriti &#8216;Sadasraye Abhayambike&#8217; in Samaram  launched the Navavaranam. Absolute submission to the divine has been highlighted in this composition with repeated references to  &#8216;Asraye.&#8217; The charanam of the song refers to Devi as &#8216;Chidambara Chandrike&#8217; meaning the &#8216;moon in the sky of consciousness,&#8217; a beautiful expression  with profound meaning, Sivasri observed.The second avaranam in the raga Kalyani &#8216;Abhayamba Jagadamba&#8217; described the qualities of the goddess and the importance of devotion. &#8216;Aryam Abhayambam&#8217; (Bhairavi) imparted the need for a mind focused in bhakti and her guidance as a guru. The extended charanam starting with &#8216;Nandana vana&#8217; almost resembled a garden of assorted flowers of colour and fragrance represented by the beauty of words, music and sense.The fourth in the raga Sankarabharanam &#8216;Girijaya ajaya&#8217; signified &#8216;Atma tatvam&#8217; and the  theory of equanimity.  The four lines in the charanam summarised the concept of navavarana puja effectively.The fifth one &#8216;Abhayambikayai aswaroodhayayai&#8217; (Yadukulakhambodi) formed the archana praising the goddess, with the names figuring in  Lalitha Sashasranamam. The names are not a random choice  but selected with purpose and special meaning. The Kedaragowla kriti &#8216;Abhayambikaya&#8217; emphasised on meditation with concentration of mind. The term &#8216;prakasam&#8217; used here was indicative of the supreme light that clears the darkness in mind. &#8216;Ambikaya abhayambikaya&#8217; (Kedaram) in &#8216;dasya bakthi&#8217; brought out in the charanam the esoteric secrets of &#8216;kundalini yoga.&#8217;The reposeful  Sahana kriti &#8216;Abhyambayam bhaktim&#8217; explained the greatness of self-realisation. The ninth number &#8216;Dakshayanim&#8217; in Thodi projected the abject surrender and gratitude to the godly mother. The Palasruti &#8216;Sri Abhyamba&#8217; in Sriragam was a manipravala kriti including expressions from different languages.The  kritis set in heavy weight ragas to different rhythmic patterns (Adi, Jampa, Rupakam and Triputa) were deliberated by the group comprising Kalpagam Swaminathan and L. Ramakrishnan on the veena, Sivasri Gopalakrishnan, Vasumathi Desikan and Srividya Sridhar on the vocal and Thanjavur Kumar on the mridangam.One cannot but marvel at the musical agility of Kalpagam Swaminathan, the octogenarian who played these kritis on the veena singing along with the instrument  (without looking into any reference material) and leading the group. Apparently for some artists, Kalpagam Swaminathan being one of them, ageing only adds strength and stamina to their well-nurtured talent.Poise and tranquillity prevailed  with succinct alapanas of some of the ragas.  For the limited audience, none of whom moved till the curtain came down,  it was, indeed, a wonderful prayer offered at the  sanctum sanctorum of Abhayamaba of Mayuram.
