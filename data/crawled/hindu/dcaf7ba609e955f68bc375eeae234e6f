VB. RamadeviBhavani Kishore Kumar enthralled the audience with Bharathiar's songs at Nani Palkhiwala Hall, Coimbatore, on the 12th  anniversary of Vasantha Memorial Trust, an organisation that strives to bring hope and joy to cancer patients.He began with ``Thediyunnai Sharanadainthen'' (set as varnam by Kishore Kumar himself) in Kadanakuthuhalam. ``Karpaga Vinayaga Kadavule Potri,'' the Vinayagar Agaval followed suit in Nattakkurinji, with appropriate chittaswaras. After ``Vellai Thamarai Poovil Iruppaal'' in Bhimpalas, and ``Manathil Urudhi Vendum'' in Tilang, poured in the torrential ``Vedipadum Andaththidi Pala Thalam Poda'' (``Oozhikkoothu'') in Mohanam, bringing to mind the recent devastating dance of rain in Tamil Nadu.He sang an elaborate alapana of Dharmavathi and presented ``Saagaa Varam Arulvaay Raamaa'' as if voicing the prayer of the cancer victims. The neraval and swaraprastharas were impressive. ``Kaatru Veliyidai Kannamma,'' ``Ethanai Kodi Inbam," ``Kaakkai Chiraginile," ``Yaadhumaagi Ninraay Kaalee," ``Nirpathuve Nadappathuve'' and ``Chinnanjiru Kiliye'' were some of the endearing songs he sang. The fulfilling concert was concluded with ``Vaazhiya Senthamizh." The able support of N. C. Madhav on the violin, R. Radhakrishnan on the mridangam and Kovil S. Kumar on the ghatam  added to the appeal of the concert.``Nadham," an organisation that runs with the noble intention of encouraging up and coming artistes had organised L. Ranjani's vocal concert at Hotel Rathna Regant, Coimbatore. Ranjani sang with interest and involvement.She commenced with ``Sarasooda Nine Kori," a varnam in Saveri by Kotthavasal Venkataramaiyer. ``Jaya Jaya Swamin'' in Nattai by Narayana Tirtha,  ``Diwakaratanujam'' in Yadhukulakambodi by Muthuswamy Dikshitar, ``Azhaga, Azhaga'' by Ambujam Krishna and ``Everani'' in Naga Chinthamani by Tyagaraja were well rendered. ``Ethavunara,'' the composition of Tyagaraja in Kalyani was the central piece to which she did full justice by decorating it with a good alapana, and swaraprastharas. The second half was lively with the popular songs, ``Kurai Onrum Illai," ``Deena Sharanyane," "Brahamamokate'' and ``Hari Tum Haro." She concluded her programme with a tillana in Desh.C. S. Ganesan on the violin and K. Mani on the mridangam provided  excellent support.Bottom Template Starts
