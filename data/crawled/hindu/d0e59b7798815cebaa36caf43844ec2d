VThe story is about the stunningly austere Hyderabad Brothers as much as it is about three young musicians who, in a manner most accomplished, pitched themselves on the rich, traditional canvas. Mysore Srikant on the violin, B.C. Manjunath on the mridanga and Giridhar Udupa on the ghata accompanying Seshachari and Raghavachari at the recent Fort High School concert, Bangalore, as part of the Ramanavami series, elevated it rather remarkably.With profound scholarship and a firm foot in tradition, the Brothers have a style and language that is reminiscent of the legendary Alathur Brothers. Their voices complementing each others' with ease and perfection; Seshachari is exuberant, while Raghavachari is poised. Their musical virtuosity is lucid and highly imaginative.They opened the concert with Karoor Devudu Iyer's lovely varna in Shri raga &#8220;Saami Ninne&#8221; and quickly moved to the commanding Athana. Tyagaraja's popular &#8220;Ela Nee Dayaraadu&#8221; that sets off from the tara shadja was racy and made an immediate connection with the audience. Seshachari's narration of raga Lalitha was deeply moving and intense. His stunningly beautiful alapane was insightful and when the duo moved to the kriti, it was arresting. Their treatment of the prati madhyama was particularly poignant. Raghavachari's delineation of raga Karaharapriya was stately. With his fertile imagination, the flights that he achieved from one note to the other provided an erudite framework to &#8220;Soumitri Bhagyame&#8221;.The main piece of the evening was Mohana and Seshachari built up a well-structured, magnificent raga. Their rendition of the &#8220;Mohana Rama&#8221; kriti was nuanced and well-modulated. The neraval and swara prasthara was stimulating with the Brothers outdoing each other. Mysore Srikant excelled in his interpretations and the tani was a complex and challenging exchange between Manjunath and Giridhar.And as time rolled on, the excitement of the audience only heightened. There was an outpour of requests and the extremely gentle and graceful Hyderabad brothers complied with every wish.D.G.The Sikkil school of melody is known for its innate sense of sruti and laya and expansive manodharma. Sikkil Gurucharan's concert at the Fort High school reflected just this &#8212; his tutelage is perfect and his own talent comes with remarkable proficiency. Just when you feel Gurucharan is amongst the new generation of young performers who draws you into his music, he also makes you reflect on the genre's profound potential. The way he envisages a raga, his swara kalpane and rendering of kirthane is dynamic and is yet completely immersed in tradition. All the punch in Tyagaraja's lyrics in &#8220;Najeevadhara' in Bilahari, a robust kirthane popular among yesteryear stalwarts, was brought to life by Gurucharan, with his raga mapping touching some enjoyable contours of the scale. His handling of Ranjani was graceful and he presented an enjoyable &#8220;Kaadiruvenu Naanu&#8221;, a Kannada composition by Ambujam Krishna set to tune by Madurai Seshagopalan. With Varadarajan on violin, Arjun Kumar on mridanga and Giridhar Udupa on ghata, the evening included one more of Tyagaraja's all time greats &#8220;Lavanya Rama&#8221; in Poorna Shadjam.
