VRANEE KUMARPravin Godkhindi is a name to reckon with among the present generation flautists going by the success of his recent concert in the city. He proved to be a versatile player with a mind-boggling range. He opened the Icfai Karnataka Nite withraag Yamanand it was a royal journey into music. Theraagspread across the entire gamut of stylistic embellishments. The conventionalalaapsoftly set the tone tovilambitand scaled the\u000a octaves indruthwith theJhala jhodclose behind. In the sequence at every level enriched itself in his excellent handling of the flute. The tone and tenor was amazing. The speed cycle reaching a crescendo and the \u000acascading effect thereon melting into soft notes reverberated through the auditorium in full-throated clarity. Pravin&#8217;s dexterity found its match in Sreenivasachar&#8217;s sharp and skillful strumming of the guitar which compelled attention even as it stood out in the entire band.The unisyllable play recreated the nightingale cooing in full form. Once the Yaman had its sway leaving the listeners mesmerised, Pravin gave room for Archana Udupa, a singer from Karnataka who presentedbhava geete(light music) in\u000a Kannada.  The songs, despite being composed by well-known musicians like Vyas Rao and Lakshminarayana Bhattar did not make the desired impact.The actual sweetness of Archana&#8217;s lucid voice was visible when both the artistes switched over to fusion music. This was music at its best. Pravin took up Hindustani raag -Bhup (Bhupali).For the Hyderabadi non-Kannadiga audi\u000aence, suffice to say thatRaa vela gopemmala muvva gopaludefromSagara Sangamamwas based onBhup. To enlighten the listeners, Archana lent her beautiful voice which was well-modulated unlike her \u000asolo rendition. It was a pleasant surprise when Pravin also took to singing a verse or two in dulcet tones.The Krishna Fusion band deserves a mention for enhancing the overall effect of the wonderful concert, which  was hosted by Alpha Foundation and Kannada Natya Ranga at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan auditorium.Bottom Template Starts
