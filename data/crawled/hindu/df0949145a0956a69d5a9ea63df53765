VOld-timers recall B.V.K. Shastry as an art critic and musicologist known for his objectivity and in-depth knowledge, and felicity in writing. For three decades he contributed articles on music and dance to various publications and even authored several books. Respected by artistes and the reading-public alike, he also received several awards/titles from central and state art-academies as well as private sabhas.Every year, the BVK Shastry Memorial Committee conducts an academic session in his memory to educate music-lovers on different aspects of classical music. The recent programme at Bangalore Gayana Samaja brought together art-lovers who paid rich tributes to him. It was followed by a seminar on &#8220;A Few Composers of Karnataka of the 20th Century&#8221;.  R.K. Srikantan delivering his keynote address spoke of the inexhaustible rich musical heritage that the Carnatic-music composers have left behind for all of us. He dwelt on the relationship between sahithya and sangeetha likening it to the ardhanareeshwaram concept. The audience would have liked his presentation to go on, but Srikantan, always a stickler for time, wound up quickly.With his technical mastery, and sonorous baritone voice, R.K. Padmanabha has earned deserving status as top vocalist. Padmanabha, who had mridangam support from C. Cheluvaraj and vocal accompaniment by K.V. Krishnaprasad, spoke on Mysore Vasudevachar. He began by with an overview of Vasudevachar&#8217;s life and work and then went on to a delectable, though brief, rendering of &#8220;Sharade Pahimam&#8221; in Yadukulakambhoji as an illustration of Vasudevachar&#8217;s skill in bringing out the essence and bhaava of the raga in each composition. &#8220;Bhaavayachyutham&#8221; in Purvikalyani was followed by &#8220;Dasharatha Nandana&#8221; in Mayamalavagowla etc. Padmanabha demonstrated how Vasudevachar&#8217;s krithis have beautiful sancharas and great potential for holding a note.For the Mutthaiah Bhagavathar presentation, Dr. T.S. Sathyavathy, was accompanied by accomplished mridangam artiste, V. Krishna. The erudite and articulate Sathyavathy began by providing statistics on Bhagavathar&#8217;s output. She then went on to explain with brief demonstrations, the outstanding characteristics of his work, especially his remarkable creativity in chittaiswaras, his flair for composing krithis in thrisra nadai, his skilful daru varnams, and his ease with rare ragas, etc. Sathyavathy demonstrated Bhagavathar&#8217;s felicity in embellishing chittaswarams with swaraaksharams and rhetorical beauties. She sang snatches of several Bhagavathar lyrics including Jayamahishasura mardhini in Hamsadhwani.The Rudrapatna Brothers were accompanied by mridangam artiste H.S. Sudheendra in their presentation on Veena Seshanna. They commenced by providing an overview of the range of Seshanna&#8217;s work &#8211;&#8211; varnams, krithis, thillanas, swarajathis, etc., pointing out how he was one of rare composers to create swarajathis fit for sabhagaanam (concert platform). Ragas like Kambhoji, Shankarabharanam, Saveri, Kalyani, Ganamurthi, Hindustani Kapi, Begada, etc., flowed effortlessly as the brothers provided samplings of Seshanna&#8217;s virtuosity, especially in the creation of ragamalikas and the handling of rare ragas. The perfect blend of voices and chaste classical style which characterise Rudrapatnam Brothers&#8217; performances, were in evidence even in this brief presentation.It is impossible to condense the work of any master-composers in a brief presentation. But within the time-constraints, the stalwarts did their best and provided glimpses of the greatness of these past lyricists and their immortal legacy.
