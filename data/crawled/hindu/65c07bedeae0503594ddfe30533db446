VWhen music is in the blood, it ceases to be a passion as such and tends to be proactive. Violin and vocal Carnatic maestro Komanduri Seshadri who will be receiving the &#8216;Kalaratna' (Hamsa) award this Ugadi is adept at cracking the tough idiom of Dikshitar as much as tracing the emotionality of Thyagaraja and Syama Sastri's ragas.A guru-par-excellence in enlightening his disciples on every aspect of music, Seshadri stresses the importance of bhava (emotion) as the pivot on which the entire rendition should rest. &#8220;Contrary to common thinking, Thyagaraja chose the raga that could emphasise the impact of an emotion in a particular metre when he penned his kritis. There is an ebb and flow, a stress at the right swara (syllable), a gradation, a landing and so on to the raga structure. Bearing this in mind, the singer should be able to render the lines of the kriti. Only then will he explore the frame on which that song rests. Creative improvisation pours once the heart and mind are set on the emotive element of the kriti.&#8221; This perceptiveness is the hallmark of his teaching.His musical lineage can be traced to veena vidwan Krishnamacharya, a contemporary of Thyagaraja. &#8220;Our ancestors hailed from Sriperumbudur and the family migrated in course of time to Addanki in Andhra Pradesh. Music and literature came naturally to me though the latter took a backseat in my pursuance of the former. I had done 1,000 sathakams in literature. Though I can play the veena, violin, viola as well as sing, I feel it is some superior power that has bestowed me with these abilities,&#8221; he looks up to the divine in everything he does and says.His research on Thyagaraja and his concept of music is phenomenal. He believes that prosody and verse of a kriti ought to be expressed in the classicality of music. &#8220;The lyrical value of a kriti is of sublime importance. Though Thyagaraja's was self-representative music. But then he followed the treatises of music. The metre is set and within the tune is the bhava. By comparison, Dikshitar lyrics had well-structured ragas. The potentiality of the raga is due to its samvaada notes. He is called a laksha lakshana vidwan. Shyama Sastri's lyrics have a rhythmic structure underlying them,&#8221; the intricate nuances are lucidly explained. This linguist is also a historian who has unearthed 108 composers (notations et al) of post-Thyagaraja period. Known for spontaneous composition, he is famous for his &#8216;avadhana prakriya'.
