VSVKThe distinctive style of Veena Gayatri is the felicitous fluency maintaining the accuracy of gamaka, characteristic of every raga and kirtana. The intensity and richness of her manodharma in raga alapanas are very well preserved and therein lies the secret of her music's appeal, a fact yet again confirmed at the Asthika Samajam's Rama Navami series.In her alapanas of Pantuvarali, Abheri and Sankarabharanam, Gayatri gave free rein to her fingering supremacy over the frets. Delightful development of the raga sancharas gave new dimensions to delicacy of expression. Particularly, in the delineation of Sankarabharanam her fecund articulation with subtle gamakas was both reflective and gentle.Gayatri was quite at ease with the graciousness of the songs "Tulasi Dalamulache" (Mayamalavagowla) and "Rama Bhakti" (Suddha Bangala). After conveying the glowing elegance of Abheri, the Kirtana "Bhajare Re Manasa" of Vasudevachar was well rendered with its resplendent sahitya beauty. "Manasu Swaadinamai" (Sankarabharanam) emerged with aesthetic flows. There was organised discipline in framing the recital.Madirimangalam Swaminathan (mridangam) and Madippakkam Murali (ghatam) cast aside the temptations of frenetic beats and tuned themselves to harmonise with the veena's soft sound.Bottom Template Starts
