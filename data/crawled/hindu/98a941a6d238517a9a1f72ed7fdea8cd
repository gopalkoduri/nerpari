VSukanya Prabhakar's concert at Shriramaseva Mandali, Mysore, created congenial ambience to experience and appreciate the kernel of classical music &#8212; Bhakthi, couched in a stable and scholarly idiom.Fine taste and refinement characterised her style, and succulent expressive voice fortified by emotive vocal modulations fully realised that music's lofty objective, as set and expected by the wise Vaggeyakara-s.Intuitive planning incorporating all the necessary musical ingredients played vital role for complete success, in addition to an apt tempo facilitating expressions. She created remarkable homogeneity between different stages of progressions: balance, restraint and proportion working invariably as controlling and guiding factors.Take for example either &#8220;Paramapurusha&#8221; (Vasantha- Swathi Thirunal) or &#8220;Shri Ramya Chittalankara Swarupa&#8221; (Jayamanohari- Thyagaraja): in addition to clear diction and accentuations, these numbers received her close attention in matters of embellishments too.Observe how the mature singer pivoted the passages of swarakalpana around rishabha while she imaginatively, delicately and fluently wreathed the phrases, meticulously taking care to preserve the import of Shri Ramya Chittalankara (indeed a paradigm of intonation pattern) portraying the resplendent beauty of the Lord. &#8220;Shri Rama Rama Jagadathmarama&#8221; (Purnachandrika-Thyagaraja) was another of the same order.Sukanya methodically delineated the charming personality of Mohana (focus of the concert, &#8220;Mohana Rama&#8221; - Thyagaraja) prefacing the composition. Whereas a neraval at the anupallavi, &#8220;Mohana Rama Modati Daivamu&#8221;, tunefully accomplished the verbal meaning, the swarakalpana completed the musical experience.All along, the accompanists, H.K. Narasimhamurthy (violin), Cheluvaraju (mridanga) and G.S. Ramanujam (ghata), committed themselves to this memorable music commanding respects and adorations.Some more compositions conforming to the above standards were &#8220;Rama Ramenniro&#8221; (Malahari - Purandaradasa- emotively sung), &#8220;Sakethanagaranatha&#8221; (Harikambhoji &#8211; Mysore Sadashiva Rao &#8211; with a pleasing neraval at &#8220;Raajita Amarapaala&#8221; raised to the standards of a pallavi), &#8220;Veene Hididudeno&#8221; (Hamir- Kolara Padmabai) and &#8220;Rama Naama Sab&#8221; (Hindi Bhajan &#8212; Yamuna Kalyani &#8212; R.N. Doreswamy).Bharath Sundar sang in the same venue, accompanied by Charulatha Ramanujam (violin), H. S. Sudhindra (mridanga) and S. Manjunath (ghata).Almost half of the concert did not gain any significant momentum, other than convincing the audience of the artiste's fluent and melodious voice. &#8220;Nee Dayaraada&#8221; (Vasantha Bhairavi - Thyagaraja), &#8220;Evarani&#8221; (Devamrithavarshini -Thyagaraja), &#8220;Idi Samayamu&#8221; (Naatakapriya &#8211; Vasudevacharya), &#8220;Ksheenamai Thiruga&#8221; (Mukhari-Thyagaraja) affirmed the above observations, except that the alapana in Mukhari was pleasing though not remarkable.&#8220;Nidhichala Sukhama&#8221; (Kalyani - Thyagaraja) gave an astounding turn. The young singer's scholarship and competence unravelled to reach great heights from every point &#8212; melody, proportion, intricacies, expressions and method. Nevertheless, the process of shrutibedha (Mohana and Shuddha Dhanyasi) could have been clear and precise.Neatly drawn alapana, impressively presented lyrics, meaning-oriented neraval (&#8220;Mamatha Bandhanayutha&#8221;) and inspiring swarakalpana bore testimony to the artiste's penchant and panache, liberally compensating more than what the listeners were deprived of in the previous numbers.In a way, the above number inspired the learned accompanists to display their learning and expertise without any reserve; and as such, those that followed, &#8220;Jagadhodharana&#8221; (Kaapi-Purandaradasa) and thillana (Maand-Lalgudi Jayaraman) carried forward the same delectable experience delighting the audience.
