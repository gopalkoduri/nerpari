VIn an attempt to bring focus on to the Telugu language, noted cine lyricist and parody writer, Jonnavittula Ramalingeswara Rao came up with a musical with a rare blend of poetry and orchestration &#8212; more precisely the percussion instrument of mridangam. Naturally, he selected the mridangam maestero Yella Venkateswara Rao for his experiment. The result was &#8216;Padya-Vadya Kacheri' on the evening of Mahasivaratri at Shilpakala Vedika in Hyderabad.The whole programme was replete with the echo of Lord Siva, the writer of the &#8216;Ramalingeswara Satakam', the basis for the recital being the boon of Siva for his parents Subba Rao and Lakshminarasamma, the Vedic chanting done by Kuppa Siva Subrahmanya Avadhani and party and the invocative discourse of blessings by the veteran advocate of mythological lore, Malladi Chandrasekhara Sastry. Apart from mellifluous vocals by Dhanumjay, the instrumentalists &#8212; Peri Tyagaraju on violin, Umapati Pramod on flute, Lakshmi Padmavathi on veena, Ganesh and Nageswara Rao on keyboard, Sreedhar on tabla, Master Somasekhar on ghatam, Master Abhishek and Prem on pads, Brahmam for stage craft, Tarun Kumar on guitar and Baby Swathi for taalam provided a wholesome orchestration. Yella Venkateswara Rao stood out distinguished with a rare symphony, transporting the connoisseurs into trance with his percussion effects in a very creative and innovative manner.A restrain note of the poem set in a particular raga and taala was recreated on a particular instrument. For instance raag Kadanakutuhala went very well on mridangam in the hands of Yella and &#8216;sankha (conch) naad' on morsing in &#8216;maani vrittam'. Bell was used for a repetitive tandava effect of &#8216;Dhrita sardoolam' and on veena 3-4 notes dovetailed into seven swaras. In a way from &#8216;Akshara naada' instrumental effect was brought in and the sound of water drops were set as &#8216;guru ganas' in &#8216;Bindu Sardulam'. The prosody of the poetry chosen for the experiment was matchless.
