VThis year&#8217;s Shivaratri festival at the Vadakkunnathan temple  got off to a fine start with a sterling performance by renowned violinist,  M.S. Gopalakrishnan (MSG). He was accompanied by his daughter,  G. Narmada, and son, Suresh Gopalakrishnan.The &#8216;violin trio&#8217; as they are called, started off  with an Ada Tala varnam in raga Kamboji, a Swati Tirunal composition. There was an impressive delineation of Mayamalavagowla and the well-known composition &#8216;Deva Deva Kalayami&#8230;,&#8217; followed. &#8216;Shiva, Shiva, Shiva,&#8217; a Tyagaraja kriti, was aptly chosen and brilliantly executed and &#8216;Manasayadulu&#8217; in raga Malayamarutham was also excellent.M.S.G&#8217;s  technique recreates a vocal style in which each swara is  precise and clearly enunciated. R. Vaidyanathan on the mridangam and Perikavu P.L. Sudhir on the ghatom provided able support.Kavalam Sreekumar began with  an  invocation, &#8216;Vatapi Ganapathim&#8217; in Hamsadhwani. Sreekumar had innovative passages, but his style was jerky, at times. The alapanam in Kanada lacked depth. But &#8216;Akhilandeswari,&#8217; the Dikshitar composition in raga Dwijavanthi, flowed mellifluously.Edapally Ajithkumar&#8217;s violin introduction to this item was especially excellent. Mohanam was the main raga chosen for the evening. Taniavaratnam by K. Jayakrishnan (mridangam) and V. Sreejith was competitive and at times a little aggressive.Mandolin U. Rajesh lived up to the family name and his recital was clear proof of his expertise.  He began with a breezy varnam in raga Vasantham and moved on to &#8216;Maha ganapathim&#8217; in  Nata. The reverberation of the bass notes and his incredible speed made the manodharma power-packed.The undulating progress of raga Andolika (&#8216;Ragasudha Rasa&#8217;) and the oblique swaras of raga Gowda Malhar in the kriti, &#8216;Sarasamukhi&#8217; were portrayed well. Ragas Pantuvarali and Shyama also made brief appearances before he  settled down to the main raga, Shanmugapriya. Rajesh exploited the full range of his instrument and the movement from the low to the high registers was effortless. At places one could hear  the influence of both Western classical music and Jazz.The violin accompaniment by T.H. Subramaniam deserves special mention for its brilliance. Veterans Udupi Sreedhar on the ghatom and Thanjavur Murukabhupati on the mridangam,  were  at ease and equally matched in the taniavaratanam.As a diversion from the theme of Shiva,  the Kathakali performance was based on Lord Krishna and his  classmate, Sudama.  &#8216;Kuchelavritham&#8217; play had Sadanam Naripatta Narayanan Namboodiri as Kuchela and Sadanam Bhasi as Krishna. The libretto &#8216;Kalayami Sumathe&#8217; was expounded in detail.  It was thrilling to see the way in which the famous lines like &#8216;Ajitha Harey&#8217; and &#8216;Sarasa Nethra&#8217; were interpreted by these seasoned actors.  Sadanam Bhasi had invested his character with a lot of depth. Haripriya Namboodiri, graceful and gentle, played the role of Rugmini.
