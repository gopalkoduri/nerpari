VYouth! Put away your books and get immersed in music. It is that time of the year when academics takes the back seat and art dominates. &#8216;Svanubhava,' the six-day festival, conducted by Matrka and YACM, begins on August 2. Trichur Ramachandran sets the ball rolling at Kalakshetra, where the festival will be inaugurated at 9 a.m., by jawahar Sircar, Secretary, Ministry of Culture, Government of India.Upbeat on the eve of the event, T.M. Krishna and Bombay Jayashri quickly go over the highlights of &#8216;Svanubhava 2010.' The festival has been a hit in the past two years and the third edition is bigger in scale with new elements. To begin with, more schools are participating this year. &#8220;Schools always sent bus loads of children, learning music and interested in the art. But this year they have offered to be hosts,&#8221; says Krishna. Thus we find Chettinad Harishree Vidyalayam, Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan and Vidya Mandir, Mylapore, among the venues. Kalakshetra and the Music Academy are the other places.The Government Music College is out of the picture since the premises is under renovation. The overwhelming response from the student community in the past two years has warmed the hearts of the organisers, who have included several new programmes.Classicism in filmsCinema makes its entry in the form of a discussion on the humour element (August 3) with Y.G. Mahendra, ARS and Crazy Mohan on the panel. Rajiv Menon and S.P. Balasubramaniam will talk about classicism in film songs (August 4).&#8220;SPB is a veteran, who has sung for all the composers. Menon is an avid follower of Carnatic music with good knowledge. The dialogue is sure to be absorbing and will kindle interest among the youth,&#8221; say the vocalists.Stars of the future will present a concert supported by leading accompanists (August 5) at PSBB. Vidushi Vedavalli has given shape to the concept and the artists are Kunnakudy Balamuralikrishna, Prasanna Venkatraman, Amrita Murali and Nisha Rajagopal, H.N. Bhaskar and Poongulam Subramaniam. Another new player is Koothupattarai, which will present a play, post-lunch at the venue.The audience will have a taste of a rare art on August 4 at Harishree Vidyashram. A 15-member Panchavadyam team led by Chottanikkara Subash Narayan Marar will present a concert.Three generations combine to thrill the listeners on August 6, at the Music Academy. N. Rajam, daughter Sangeetha Shankar and grand daughters Ragini and Nandini will present a grand violin concert.Heritage takes centrestage on August 7, the curtain coming down with the Varkari Sampradaya Bhajans sung by Tukaram Ganapathy Maharaj.There is much more in the form of debates, dance presentations by eminent personalities such as Malavika Sarukkai and Alarmael Valli, quiz sessions and regular concerts.It is going to be a sumptuous feast for the young audience. &#8220;We expect a turn out of 1,500-2,000 each day,&#8221; say the organisers.&#8220;The base is broadening and we are happy that students from various backgrounds will be participating. After all, that is the aim of Svanubhava &#8211; reaching art to the youth, across strata and status,&#8221; they sum up.Registrations are open at www.svanubhava.comWhere and whenVenues (9 a.m.-3.30 p.m.)August 2 and 3 KalakshetraAugust 4 Chettinad Hari Shree VidyalayamAugust 5 Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan, K.K.
