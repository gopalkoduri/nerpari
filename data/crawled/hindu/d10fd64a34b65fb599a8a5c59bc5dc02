VVisakha Music Academy, which organises a music concert every month, has also been encouraging young artistes by way of a mini festival conducted in June annually.The fete that was held last week in Kalabharathi featured two vocal, a veena and a mandolin recital on the first two days. Young vocalist Chaganti Kalyana Vasantha rendering theBhairavi Atatalavarnam, the suffix ofswaramtoVaataapi Ganapathimbhaje, prefix ofaalapanatoTulasidalamulache(Maayamaalavagoula) and the elaboration ofNeeducharanapankajamulu (Kalyaniwithneravuas well) perfectly, showcased her knowledgeable mettle. H. Ramcharan and P.V. Mehar Sagar of the same age group lent commensurable support on violin and mridangam.The scintillating recital on mandolin next by U. Srinivasu of Nakkapalli, though rather exuberantly went in fast tempo, surfaced another artiste of high potential in the making. Elaboration ofParandhamavathi (Dharmavathi), Paramapaavana Rama (Poorvikalyani)andNagumomu (Abheri)besides the rendering ofEndaromahanubhavulustood out. Young P. Gyandev on violin and A. Ananda Srihari on mridangam in particular lent excellent support.The second day witnessed engaging veena and vocal recitals by Kasturi Kamala Deepthi and SMGSN Lavanya. Expansive elaboration ofManasu swaadheenamaina (Sankarabharanam)on veena by Deepthi and Mohana Rama (Mohana) by Lavanya were the highlights. While P. Jayadev on mridangam lent commensurable support to Deepthi, Parthiva on violin and especially M.V. Mehar Kalyani lent excellent support on mridangam.A. RAMALINGA SASTRYBottom Template Starts
