VKalavardhanisREC 314DevotionalSongs of Sadasiva BrahmendraDr. Prameela GurumurthyRs. 50Sadasiva Brahmendra (circa 1741 A.D.) may not be classified as a music composer in the strict sense of the term, but his two compositions in Sanskrit are matchless in lyrical beauty, and form an integral part of the canon of bhajana in South India.Although, Subbarama Dikshitar in his Sangita Sampradaya Pradarshani credits Brahmendra with the music for the songs, in course of time many musicians have set tuneful melodies for the sahitya.Prameela Gurumurthy, the Head of the Department in  Madras University, has recorded 13 songs of Sadasiva Brahmendra for Kalavardhanis.The ragas Atana, Darbari, Misramand, Poorvi Kalyani, Sama Senchurutti, Hindolam, Peelu, Gamuna Kalyani, Kunthalavarali, Sindhubhairavi and Surati are employed sensitively and mellifluously, many of which speak volumes for Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer&#8217;s intuitive, instinctive, ingenious imagination. The artiste with her dulcet voice renders the songs nurturing and nourishing the all pervasive spirit of devotion. The programme with no intrusive orchestral back drop, is ablely supported by Neela Jayakumar on the violin and V. Jayakumar on the mridangam.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
