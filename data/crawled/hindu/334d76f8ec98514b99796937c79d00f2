VThe vocal concert by Kalpana Sumanth at Sri Ramaseva Samithi Charitable Trust, V.V. Mohalla, Mysore, was exceptional and unique. Adherence to shruthi and laya crispness in the svarakalpana were hallmarks of the concert. Well-trained in Gwalior gharana by Pandit Maruthi Rao Inamdar and Veena Sahasrabuddhe, the artiste kept to the tradition of Hindustani Classical in choosing the right ragas for the occasion. The meaning of the compositions were well explained by the artiste's father Uma Shankar, who also accompanied her on the svaramandal. On the lighter side, Kalpana continued her concert with a few compositions, specially designed for Sri Ramanavami Music Festival, "Rama Rama He Ram" in Mishra Kedar, "Jaya Hanuman Gnana Sukha Sagar" in rag Durbari and "Jaya Jaya Aarathi Rama Tumhare" in concluding rag Mishra Bhairav. Vyasaramurthy Katti on harmonium and Ravindra Yavgal on tabla gave inspiring support.Stress on techniqueCarnatic vocal concert by Tiruchi Ramesh at the same venue was full of textual content in music. Beginning from the rare ubhaya vakra shadava raga derived from the melakarta Natabhairavi, Hindola Vasantham ("Santhana Ramaswaminam" of Dikshitar), the artiste threw more light towards technique and body language than soul touching contentment of chaste music.  Nevertheless, the clarity in sahitya was appreciable. Delineation of raga Kamach ("Seethapathe" of Sri Tyagaraja) and Mohana ("Nanu Palimpa") were fully explored.  Jyotsna Srikanth on the violin gave the required melody to ragabhava and Vidwan Cheluvaraj's mridangam was supportive.B.S.S. RAOBottom Template Starts
