VThe accompanists for the concert that evening were Patri Satish Kumar on the mridangam, Bangalore Rajasekhar on the morsing and Durga Prasad on the pakhvaj.After the traditonal honouring of the artistes by Swami Gomothi Dos of the Peetam, the concert began with Hamsadhwani but not before the artiste took some time for the sound check.Kadri started the alapana at a leisurely pace and with Ronu joining him now and then, meandering around the lower Nishadam, one thought it would be an evening of soulful music. But it turned out to be otherwise.&#8216;Vatapi&#8217; (Adi-Dikshathar) was the piece that was taken was taken up. As the pallavi was on with the sangathis, the mridangam and the pakhwaj player wanted an increase in the volume with the result it became a blast.  It all turned out to be a swara circus like a snake and ladder game.Amidst all this,  it was indeed ironical to find Rajasekhar almost forgetting to pick up his instrument and when he did  his mike was not working. Ronu tried his best to present Chandrakauns with all its inherent beauty. Once Kadri joined him the meditative phrases were brushed aside.The alapana lacked any depth and imagination. This was followed by a pallavi set to Adi talam in rettai kalai which was sung for the audience by Kadri initially.Half way through, for reasons best known to the artistes it was converted into a single-kalai  and the fusillade continued. Even the tail pieces  Venkatachala Nilayam (Sindhubhairavi-Adi-Purandaradasar) and Raghupathi Raghava Raja Ram were not spared.  Coming out of the hall, it seemed the din of George Town was lesser.
