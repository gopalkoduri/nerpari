VAll India Radio&#8217;s FM channel Rainbow in its Monday programme &#8220;Classical Highlights&#8221; recently provided information regarding the centenary of Bulgaria&#8217;s freedom. It was, however, not mentioned as to who the &#8216;captors&#8217;\u000a; were. Though one would make a guess about the Turkman Empire being the rulers.  Surprisingly, the programme also didn&#8217;t mention the period of the Empire&#8217;s rule over the Bulgarians. To the programme&#8217;s producers, one would like to say that listeners would have liked to learn about the socio-cultural impact of the captors and the captives besides listening to some of the Bulgarian composers&#8217; classical works and its rich heritage of folk music. The recordings could have been easily obtained from the friendly Bulgarian Embassy at New Delhi&#8217;s Chanakyapuri or from the Indo-Bulgarian Cultural Society at Jorbagh.What one heard at the programme were a couple of Beethovan&#8217;s piano works. It was not clear if these were played by Bulgarian musicians. The only Bulgarian music played in the programme was the country&#8217;s lively and colourful national anthem.In the week that followed, &#8220;Classical Highlights&#8221; relayed soulful Indian classical music. For instance, Vidushi Sulochana Brahaspati&#8217;s khayals in the morning raga Ramkali was a delight for her pleasing rendition of the raga&#8217;s contours and her tunefulness in developing with well-deployed nuances. Quite a few of her superfast &#8216;sapaat-taans&#8217; were sung with utmost clarity and tunefulness.Also, Braj Madhuri was delightful for the musical dialogue between mother Yashoda and the little Krishna denying the former&#8217;s charges of stealing butter. This was followed by colourful folk songs of Himachal Pradesh by groups of men and women. Vishnu Dutt Sharma&#8217;s flute recital in the pentatonic melody of the raga Bhupali impressed for his able understanding of the raga and his tuneful handling of the flute with sonorously released phrasings.The weekly &#8220;Chayan&#8221; programme on the channel featured recordings of the late D.V. Paluskar, son of the late Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, who passed away while DVP was just a little child. He was trained by the late Pandit Vinayak Rao Patwardhan who was Vishnu Paluskar&#8217;s senior-most disciple. DVP&#8217;s renderings of a slow khayal (&#8220;Sughar Ban&#8221;) in the serene raga Puriya followed by a Teen tala piece (&#8220;Sapane Mein Aaye&#8221;) in the same raga impressed for his handling of the raga&#8217;s complex format with scholarly approach and a highly developed musicianship. His next rendering was in the raga Nand (&#8220;Ajhun Naa Aaye&#8221;) and finally concluding with a tarana. The next day, the listeners of the programme could tune in to Pandit Bhajan Sopori&#8217;s  neat and tuneful santoor recital. Sopori impressed with his superb handling of the instrument and the understanding of the format of the morning raga Gurjari Todi. Two days later, the programme featured sarod player Sunil Mukherji. He delighted listeners with his recital in raga Sindhu Bhairavi with charmingly etched nuances which indicated the influence of the style of the greatest sarod maestro Ustad Ali Akbar Khan. Sunil&#8217;s plucking of the strings with his jaba (plectrum) was with utmost care. The mid-tempo Teen tala composition was handled in a leisurely manner and with scores of charmingly executed variations culminating with a pleasingly provided accompaniment on the tabla by Vinod Pathak.
