VThe first concert by veteran veena vidwan E. Gayathri saw a brilliant expression of the contrast between the melody of the raga and the percussive force of the thanam in ragam thanam pallavi, proving how eminently the veena is suited for this popular concert piece.Chittaiswarams and kalpanaswaras came to life when O.S.Tyagarajan sang Syama Sastry&#8217;s &#8216;Viranavara&#8217; in Kalyani.The highlight of the concert was a masterly alapana in Thodi.S. Sowmya put the audience at ease with familiar numbers. She paid homage to S. Ramanathan, her guru, when she sang his composition, &#8216;Adidum Arase&#8217; in Surutti.Mandolin U. Shrinivas&#8217;s  concert was a veritable treat and a showcase of  his consummate skill.Each time he picked up the mike to announce the song that he was about to render, the audience sat up with expectations, waiting for his innovative interpretation.The alapana in Hindolam,  with short delicate brigas, picked up pace and evolved into a masterpiece.It was a well-attended concert by the duo Shanmugapriya and Haripriya, wherein they synchronised admirably.Manodharma dominated as Bombay Jayashree journeyed inward to explore the gentle nuances of music. She created the mood of the raga exquisitely in the ragam thanam pallavi. However, melody permeated the thanam too, and rhythm took a side step in most of the phrases.Vijay Siva entertained his rasikas with a fine feel for proportion. His empathy with the audience was evident in the selection of songs. The artist&#8217;s alapanas were full-throated and rhythmic in the established tradition, expressing a wide range of emotions at the same time.&#8216;Kamakshi,&#8217; a swarajathi in Bhairavi by Syama Sastri, was selected by Sikkil Gurucharan as the main piece and his alapana for the same was extempore and excellent. The pallavi which is sung in lower octaves was finely set off by the kalpanaswaram scanning the three octaves.A noticeable variety in the selection of songs, and pace of rendering were other praiseworthy attributes.A youthful crowd assembled to witness Anita Ratnam&#8217;s dance performance. Popular media person, Revathi Sankaran, clad in a brilliant blue nine yards sari, introduced the theme as &#8216;Neelam,&#8217; symbolising the dark complexioned Perumal.This programme was a stylistic exploration of the Lord&#8217;s relationship with Thirumagal, Kodhai, Radhai and Seethai. Though Anita&#8217;s use of simple props to dramatise scenes from the puranas may have been inspired by the theatre, mime and ballet of the west, the programme was classical in spirit.Sentimental, poignant and philosophical, the daughter of the land delighted devotees.Flautist S. Shashank and accompanist Akkarai Subbulakshmi on the violin, were supported by two mridangists, Jayachandra Rao  and Neyveli Venkatesh.  The interaction among these performers was stimulating and provided an audio visual variation.The &#8216;multi-flute transposed fingering technique&#8217; ensuring the covering of the three octaves was put to good effect. Shashank&#8217;s interaction with the audience made the programme an unforgettable experience.Maharajapuram S. Srinivasan sang numerous familiar ragas like Hamsadhwani, Asaveri, Khamas and Ritigowlai, enthralling the audience with his style and vigorous swaraprastharas. Ganesh Viswanathan, his son, provided vocal accompaniment. Their voices synchronised  well.Sriram Parasuram and Anuradha Sriram&#8217;s jugalbandhi was a good attempt to draw parallels between Carnatic and Hindustani music.Four sets of identical or closely related ragas were presented to the audience.Sudha Raghunathan  sang &#8216;Varana mugane,&#8217; &#8216;Akilandeshwari&#8217; and &#8216;Ma Ramana&#8217; in a lively manner. Her selection of songs was a bit hackneyed to those who have listened to her for quite some years.Nithyashree displayed an excellent range and power in her voice, which is entirely in control when she sings her sahityas and alapanas, bringing out the feel of the raga. The singer&#8217;s alapana in Bhairavi, particularly in the mantara stayi was effective.The concerts proved that in a world of instant connectivity and abundant availability of electronic music, the kutcheri experience is gratifying like no other.
