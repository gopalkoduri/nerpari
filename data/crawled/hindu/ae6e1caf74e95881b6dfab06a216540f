VShertalai Ranganathan Sharma, accompanied by B. Raghuram (harmonium), Arjun Kumar (mridanga), Giridhar Udupa (ghata) and Pramath Kiran (morsing), presented a vocal recital as part of the 18 {+t} {+h} Aradhana Sapthaha conducted by the BTM Cultural Academy, Bangalore, recently.The concert, comprising compositions of Maharaja Swathi Tirunal, began with &#8220;Chalamela&#8221;, the splendid ata thala varna in Shankarabharanam, and &#8220;Pahi Sreepathe&#8221; in Hamsadhwani raga. &#8220;Paripalaya Saraseeruhalochana&#8221; in Panthuvarali, rendered at a brisk pace, featured a neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Sree Padmanabha&#8221;. While &#8220;Kalaye Devadavam&#8221;, in Ranjini was prefaced with a mellow raga alapana and suffixed with kalpana swaras. &#8220;Jalajanabha&#8221; in Kedaragoula was underscored by a sedate tempo that illumined its structural and lyrical beauty.The main raga of the evening, Saveri, was elaborated in leisurely fashion with deep gamakas and subtle shades, long reposeful pauses at the panchama and thara sthayi shadja, a notable stress on the thara sthayi gandhara and madhyama, and a sprinkling of briga-oriented phrases, supported by superb harmonium accompaniment. &#8220;Anjaneya Raghuramadutha&#8221; in adi thala, presented in an ideal kalapramana, was adorned with a fine neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Kunjara Varenyaayutha Sathva&#8221;, and a scintillating tani avarthana.The vocalist's aesthetic sensibility and rich manodharma, buttressed by an unrelenting grip over the grammar of the idiom, were explicit throughout the performance, which concluded with a couple of Hindustani bhajans, and &#8220;Bhaja Bhaja Manasa&#8221; in Sindhubhairavi. One of the several exquisite padams, or a selection from the &#8220;Utsavaprabandham&#8221;, would, however, have made the presentation more representative of the royal composer's versatility and genius.***The Rajamahal Vilas Sangeetha Sabha hosted a vocal concert by Dr. Nagavalli Nagaraj, accompanied by Ranjini Nagaraj (vocal support), A.R. Krishnamurthy (violin) and Harinarayana K. (mridanga), last week.The varnam &#8220;Amma Anandadayini&#8221; in Gambhira Natta raga and adi thala, was followed by the lilting Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Girirajasutha Thanaya&#8221; in Bangala, embellished with a few kalpana swaras. A compact alapana of Nasikabhushani, and the composition &#8220;Maravairi Ramani&#8221; in rupaka thala, were followed by a brief exposition of Hindolam and the beautiful composition &#8220;Chinthayami Jagadambam&#8221;, set to jhampa thala.The elaboration of Abheri, the main raga of the evening, began with a meditative exploration of the mandra sthayi descending to the panchama and gandhara, and progressing gradually to the higher octaves, emphasising the melodious facets and fine nuances of the scale. The exercise culminated in a crescendo of briga-oriented sancharas in the tara sthayi, dwelling effortlessly on the madhyama and panchama, and making brief forays to the swaras beyond. Thyagaraja's &#8220;Nagumomu&#8221; in adi tala was reinforced with a detailed neraval at the charanam, beginning &#8220;Jagamele Paramathma&#8221;, befitting the magnificence of the krithi itself and its position as the focal point of the concert. Several rounds of kalpana swaras, featuring effortlessly interwoven and symmetrical rhythmic patterns, ended with a segment of diminishing cycles around the tara sthayi shadja, augmented by diligent and apt support from the violinist and mridangist, and followed by a well-structured tani avarthana.The concluding pieces included &#8220;Enu Madalo Ranga&#8221; in Mohanam and &#8220;Tamburi Meetidava&#8221; in Sindhubhairavi.
