VShripada Heggade sang under the auspices of Swarasankula Sangeetha Sabha. The programme was in memory of two great luminaries, Ganayogi Panchakshari Gawai and his disciple and successor, Padmabhushana Puttaraja Gawai.He sings with great vivacity. The senior artiste's voice is noticeably soft, gentle and consistent particularly in the middle and the lower octaves. It tended to be stentorian in the higher ones, losing its timbre and balance in faster paces. Moreover, this latter shortcoming rendered part of the antara sections not very pleasing, and this was more pronounced when he tried to infuse elements of dramatic bravura into passages under consideration, which seemed to create a sense of wonder rather than to render them melodic and appealing.&#8220;Banara Mora Aye&#8221; in Yaman was impressive in many respects. It was a systematic, unhurried and analytical badhat (evolvement) incorporating all the necessary embellishments: broadly, scholarly sargams and vigorous taans. The general fluency was astounding and the manner in which he was arriving at precise cadences was amazing.With adequate stresses on the lyrics, the cheez shone brilliantly with sentiments one expected from a singer of his stature. For example, observe how meaningfully he interpreted the line, &#8220;Mothiyan Singarva&#8221; with adequate emphasis on the import it carried.&#8220;Jane Nahi Deta&#8221; created a sense of awe particularly when followed by brisk tarana &#8211; in the latter part of which, series of rhythm climaxes reined the hall. So far so good.In total contrast to the above, it was hard to make out what the singer was about to realise in Purandaradasa's &#8220;Guruvina Gulamanaguvathanaka&#8221;. Was he introducing different ragas (deprived of their expected moods), by singing their respective scales? Was such swara-singing intended to serve as prefatory embellishments? Did such crammed passages exemplify any specific genre of singing? These points were beyond any average listener's comprehension. The entire proceeding appeared muddled up with expressions not in any way well defined. Besides, the skein that was thus created was not melodic either: laalithya was something that was missing all along.***On this occasion, the Sabha honored the veteran, Siddaramaswamy Koravara by bestowing on him the title Swaragandharva. The veteran gave an impressive concert rightly acknowledging the title. The frail chords did not in any way jeopardise or mar the spirit of music and the drive; at every level, his renditions revealed riyaz and sadhana.For the vilambit section, he sang &#8220;Gave Guni Gandharv&#8221; in Puryakalyan , and for the drut, the cheez was &#8220;Pagva Brij Ko Dekhne&#8221; . Imaginative taans and sargams beautified the lyrics, as they did another of his selections, &#8220;Ek Pal Na Lage&#8221; in Chappakali (similar to Vachaspati of Carnatic Music). He concluded with &#8220;Baaju Bandh&#8221; in Bhairavi.Shriram Bhat (harmonium &#8211; appropriately followed the lead artistes in every movement), Vishwanath Nakod (tabala &#8211; cynosure of the stage brightened the concerts), accompanied both above singers.
