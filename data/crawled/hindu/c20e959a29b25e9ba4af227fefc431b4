VCD's AM 5054 AM 5055 Amutham Music-Marati-Guruji Haridas Giri  -Devotional, Rs.150 each."KALAU SANKEERTHYA Kesaram" says the Vishnupuranam.Meditation in Krutha Yuga, Penance in Tretha Yuga, Archana in Dwapara Yuga and the chanting of the divine names of Gods in the Kali Yuga are the royal paths that lead to salvation and a state of beatitude.The quality of the devotional hymns of sants of Maharashtra such as Tukaram, Gnaneshwar, Namdev, Samartha Ramdas, Eknath and others is timeless.Swami Haridas Giri was the disciple of Swami Gnanananda who was the sixth in the line of descendants of the Sankara Jyotir Math.He propagated the importance of Nama Sankeertanam through his chosen `sishya,' Haridas Giri.One remembers vividly how devotees used to flock to his devotional programmes at the Sri Gnanananda Hall and remained in an exalted state of devotion, rapture and ecstasy for hours together.The songs of the above mentioned saints in these two volumes, sung with a remarkable, rich resonance by Swami Haridas Giri, lead to supreme bliss where the jeevatma merges smoothly with the paramatma.These albums are nonpareil in musical and devotional excellence and are a must for the bhakta's collection.
