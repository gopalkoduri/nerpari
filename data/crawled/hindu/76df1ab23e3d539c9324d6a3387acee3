VPRERANAParassala PonnammalSwathi Soft SolutionsMRP Rs. 250.Recognition comes rather late to some musicians.  Parassala Ponnammal, vidushi who is well into her eighties, is a senior vocalist from Kerala who has been recently creating waves in the Tamil Nadu concert circle. She has been a disciple of stalwarts such as Harikesanallur Muthaiah Bagavathar and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. Ponnammal&#8217;s twin compact disc album released under the banner of Swathi soft Solutions has the vocalist in the company of Lalgudi Vijayalaksmi (violin) and Nanjil Arul (mridangam).The selection includes songs which were popular a few decades back as well as a couple of rare compositions. &#8216;Dayapayonidhe&#8217; in Jaganmohini (Meesu Krishna Iyer) is the chosen number for a bright opening.The singer ensures that she reaches her destination perfectly every time the kakali nishadam is approached from the panchama note. The is reflective of her commitment towards swarasthana suddham.The kriti has a chittaswara attachment which along with the kalpana swaras for the pallavi register well.A brief alapana of Begada is satisfying. &#8216;Vande Deva,&#8217; one of the navavidha bhakti kritis of the royal composer Swati Tirunal, representing &#8216;Vandanam&#8217; is sung at a brisk pace followed by a few avarthas of solfa passages sung at the beginning of the charanam &#8216;Pavanasana.&#8217;&#8216;Bhavaye&#8217; in Sriranjani (Swati Tirunal) is a creation which is not frequently heard and is refreshing. A kriti in Mohanam (Paripahi, Swathi tirunal) follows suit. The major number in the first disc is the monumental &#8216;Maanasa Guruguha&#8217;of Muthuswamy Dikshitar in Anandabhairavi.Ponnammal&#8217;s vinyasa of the melody is a meaningful essay with the vocalist realising the extent to which her voice would cooperate in the upper register. She does not overdo the alapana. Lalgudi Vijayalaksmi&#8217;s version of Anandabhairavi is highly satisfying. The jaarus and brigas are invested with a lot of raga bhava and the result is very rewarding. The violinist outshines the vocalist in her exposition of Anandabhairavi.The second disc opens with a rarely heard krithi of Muthaiah Bagavathar, &#8216;Manthrineem&#8217; in Hemavathi. The alapana, kriti, chittaswaram and the kalpanaswara passages are fair efforts. Vijayalaksmi does well to play the chittaswara after having memorised the same instead of merely following the vocalist. This adds more effect to the kriti listening.A painstaking alapana of Saveri (Anjaneya, Swati Tirunal) is the main raga offered.The slight strain in the vocal chords in the upper octave does not rob the quality of the alapana. The niraval at &#8216;Janakasudha&#8217; the kalpanaswaras, kuraippu and a simple korvai are sung with zeal.Nanjil Arul&#8217;s mridangam accompaniment is very balanced throughout this recording. He matches the pace of the vocalist and his playing blends with the music of the singer. Arul plays a short thani avarthanam in adi tala which is a mature display.&#8216;Neeke Daya&#8217; ( Neelambari, Tyagaraja )is a soulful rendering towards the close of this recording. A rather flat rendering of a Sindubhairavi song (Athatha Dani) and a Saurashtram number (&#8216;Sarasijanaba&#8217;) are the other Swati Tirunal compositions vocalised. The vishranti, poise and calm which can be experienced while listening to D.K. Pattammal can also be savoured in the music of Ponnammal. This recording provides the listener with the perennial freshness of Carnatic music.
