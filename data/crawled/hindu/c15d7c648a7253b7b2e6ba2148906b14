VTo help North Indian audiences connect with Bharatanatyam,I took something of their own and gave it back to them with a South Indian packaging.A Bharatanatyam dancer, painter, author and photographer&#8230; as Komala Varadan listed her skills, it became evident  that she certainly holds a place in the pantheon of great talents.  As the Delhi-based Komala  spoke about her artistic experience\u000as, her enthusiasm came through clearly. Her commitment to the arts is the hallmark of Kalaikoodam, the institute founded by her in Delhi, which is celebrating its silver jubilee this year.Beginning the conversation with anecdotes of her experiences as a photographer, the Delhi-based artist flipped through pages of her  photographs, each that tells a different yet endearing story. She recalled with great relish the painstaking efforts she put into capturing  the sunset over Rashtrapati Bhavan. Her creative outputs have also manifested in the written form. Komala is an author in both Tamil and English, as well as on the canvas, where she paints in many abstract hues.Of all her assorted forays into the arts, Komala is best known as a Bharatanatyam dancer. Right from the first glance, it was unmistakeable that Komala is a natural dancer  as her face came  alive with such varied expressions (mostly happiness she felt at her own achievements) that could only have been etched by years of practising abhinaya.&#8220;I have travelled to Singapore and Malaysia for concerts even as a teenager,&#8221; beamed Komala as she recalled the beginning of her career and her many years in the field. Among the numerous performances  she has staged, one that she is most well-known for is  the unprecedented adaptation of Tulsidas&#8217;s &#8216;Sri Ram Charit Manas&#8217; into traditional Bharatanatyam Margam. Her motivation for this venture came from a deep seated concern over the lack of integration and collaboration between South Indian and North Indian classical forms.&#8220;The  inclusion of a Meera bhajan in a Bharatanatyam recital performed in Delhi is a minor effort to bridge the gap,&#8221; she feels. &#8220;To help the North Indian audience connect with Bharatanatyam, I took something of their own and gave it back to them packaged differently (South Indian style), and they loved it!&#8221;It is this willingness to innovate that is the trademark of Kalaikoodam. Following the inauguration of the year-long silver jubilee festivities last year, Kalaikoodam has been staging many unique performances  that span the length and breadth of the cultural landscape of the various Indian States.A different thematic performance has been staged every month, from traditional Carnatic music performances by the likes of Chitravina Ravikiran and Sikkil Gurucharan to the lesser known traditional Assamese dances, Punjabi theatre and Maharashtrian art forms.Komala&#8217;s adaptation of &#8216;Sri Ram Charit Manas&#8217; was a highlight at the finale of the year long celebrations recently.Besides, a national seminar on &#8216;Towards a Cultural Policy&#8217; was held on the opening day of the three-day event at India International Centre in New Delhi.The concept behind these festivities &#8212; to showcase  Indian art forms from different parts of India &#8212; is congruous with the larger aims with which Kalaikoodam was established.Espousing her  motivation for Kalaikoodam, Komala said, &#8220;This is not merely an institution for dance; rather, it is an institution that aims to promote all Indian art forms without any regional or linguistic bias.&#8221;  Komala hopes to  ultimately transform this organisation into a research institute, which will be concerned with the study of the underlying cultural current that unites all Indian art forms.With her proficiency in Bharatanatyam and her base in Delhi, Komala has built a cultural bridge and contributed substantially to the country&#8217;s cultural landscape.
