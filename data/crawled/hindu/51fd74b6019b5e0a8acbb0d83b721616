VB. RAMADEVIHaving honed her skills under the tutelage of Vaigal. S. Gnanaskandan, T.N.Seshagopalan and T.Rukmini, Gayathri Girish has grown into a refined musician who believes in exercising control and presenting soothing music. This quality was prominent throughout her recent concert at Nani Kaliarangam, Coimbatore, under the aegis of Rajalakshmi Fine Arts.Following `Intha Chalamu Jesithe,' the varnam in Begada (Veenai Kuppaiyer), she presented `Saraseeruhasana Priye (Nattai - Puliyoor Duraiswamy Iyer) and `Seethaapathe' (Khamas -Tyagaraja).Melodious SaveriThe melodious delineation of Saveri preceded the kriti, `Dharidhapulekavedithe' (Tyagaraja). The other songs  were rendered in simple grandeur, giving importance to the beautifully woven lyrics. Kharaharapriya was dealt with elaborately bringing out the nuances of the raga and the not-so-often heard kriti, `Moovasai Konda Tirumal' by Harikesanallur Muthaiah Bhagavatar was presented with due ornamentation. The lighter session was lengthy lasting almost an hour.The songs she presented were delightful of course, but it was like being served high tea with a lot of delicacies, while one went expecting a wholesome meal. `Chinnanjiru Kiliye' and `Chandiran Oliyil Avalaikkanden' (both by Subramanya Bharatiar) stood out due to her emotion-filled rendering. Rasikas, seriously inclined to Carnatic music, however, would have been happier with a few more weighty songs with alapana and swaraprasthara.Mysore Srikant on the violin worked wonders with the nonchalant sweep of his bow.  J.Vaidyanathan on the mridangam and Adambakkam Shankar on the ghatam were at their best, especially during the tani.Bottom Template Starts
