VG. SWAMINATHANIt is heartening to listen to unassuming vocalists such as  the Sattur Sisters who nurture music sans pomposity.  Bhuvana and Lalitha emphasised  more on their patanthara learnt from their father Sattur Subramaniam eschewing  frills and ostentation a\u000at their concert for Nadopasana at Raga Sudha Hall. Such sober concerts should provide satisfaction to those who expect tranquillity.The sisters&#8217; voice and articulation are simple and straight forward. The concert featured  all Tyagaraja kritis.  It should be admitted that  Sattur Sisters got energised a bit late notwithstanding a few quick bits of kalpanaswaras for &#8216;Oraju Puju&#8217; (Kannada Gowla) after the sober &#8216;Melukovaiyya&#8217; (Bowli).Chakravaham was picked up for alapana by Lalitha after &#8216;Gattiganu Nanu&#8217; (Begada) and &#8216;Nee Bakthi Bhagyasudha&#8217; (Jaya Manohari), the latter with an impressive round of swaras.  Violinist Hemamalini  gave able support.&#8216;Vaachama Gocharame&#8217; in the rare raga Kaikavasi and &#8216;Vida Jaaladura&#8217; in Janaranjani bridged the gap well before Bhuvana ventured into Kalyani.Bhuvana&#8217;s interpretation of Kalyani was sensitive and steeped in tradition.The cascading phrases impressively proceeded to project Kalyani in all its  elegance. But Bhuvana could have integrated a few more passages of repose for softness and spirited brigas for radiance.Anyway, the choice of &#8216;Enduku Nee Manasu&#8217; substantiating these aspects came as a pleasant selection since the composition carried  breathtaking, razor-edged, challenging sangatis in Kalyani and none was  left out.The vocalists embellished it with a well structured niraval at &#8216;Tyagaraja Hrudaya Sada Nudani.&#8217;Hemamalini should be lauded for her assertive accompaniment with strong bowing and deft fingering.A.S.Ranganathan on the mridangam was deliberately subdued during singing but upstaged a delightfully layered tani avartanam in the company of Sethuraman on the kanjira.The closing segment was supple and soporific &#8212; &#8216;Tava Da Soham&#8217; in Punnagavarali and &#8216;Laali Yugave&#8217; in Nilambari.Bottom Template Starts
