VIt was a mesmerising and unforgettable experience for the lovers of music in Vijayawada. The person who gave them this treat was none other than internationally known tabla maestro Ustad Zakir Hussain, the prodigal son of another famous percussionist of yesteryears, Ustad Alla Rakha.Zakir Hussain was in the city to receive Dr. Pinnamaneni and Smt. Sitadevi Foundation award for this year at Tummalapallivari Kshetrayya Kalakshetram. The huge auditorium was packed to capacity and as the Ustad began his hour-long superb rhythmic magic on his instrument, the enthralled audience responded repeatedly with spontaneous ovation. One was reminded of the words spoken by late Rukmini Devi Arundale, founder of Kalakshetra in Chennai when Zakir Hussain played there at the age of nineteen. She is said to have told him after listening to him, "Zakir, you seem to have ten fingers on your right hand."Zakir Hussain played some khaidas (brief bits) which, he explained with his witty remarks, would resemble the running train, the galloping of horses, the looming dark clouds, the damaru and conch sounds, torrential rain and thunder. He even showed on the tabla the dialogue between Krishna and Radha. He finished each bit with a crescendo thrilling the audience every minute.Zakir was accompanied on the harmonium by ace harmonist Ajay Jogle. Another facet of Zakir that endeared him to the audience were his simplicity, humility and subtle humour.
