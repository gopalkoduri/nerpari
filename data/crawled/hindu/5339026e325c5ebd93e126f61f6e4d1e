VFazal exhibited the beauty of his baaj (the style of his particular  gharana)  as he played the 16-beat Teen tala.  The style of tabla playing in the Punjab gharana is termed &#8216;open-mouthed&#8217; (khula muh) following the melodious path of a simple rhythm. Cyclical and repetitive time patterns help to create an impact.Fazal does a little more by adding an electrifying speed and a rhythmic balance with the bayan.  He embroiders the basic structure with intelligent patterning.The Punjab gharana also stresses on the element of force in playing the tabla.  To  build and maintain the tempo of his concert, he introduces qayada (a technical term of tabla playing ) as a phrase and improvises it in various ways. Fazal presented more than one qayada in a new light. He also played a traditional bol of Shakir Khan in the style of his gharana.&#8220;We must preserve the traditional bols and qayadas  in order to preserve our great tradition,&#8221; he remarked during his concert.Dharmanath Mishra assisted him, playing the lehra &#8212; background melody set to the rhythmic pattern &#8212; on the harmonium.After this presentation, Fazal accompanied sitar players Shivnath Mishra and his son Deobrat Mishra of Benaras, who played  raga Jog, a well-known night-raga. They performed the raga without the gravity associated with this  serious raga, perhaps in an effort to attract new listeners. This approach was apparent right from the alap of the concert.
