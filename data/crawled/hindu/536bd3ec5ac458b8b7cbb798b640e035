VKrishna learnt the basics of the sitar from Professor Ram Chakravarty, the last sitar player  from Ustad Ashiq Ali Khan&#8217;s gharana in Varanasi.Sitarist Krishna Chakravarty, a senior disciple of Pandit Ravi Shankar, finds melody is the heart of global music. She recently returned to India after performing in Argentina. &#8220;Melody is the hallmark of Indian classical music. Artistes from India are not identified by their gharanas abroad but by the harmonious melody. Gharana confuses and melody mesmerises,&#8221; she asserts. Krishna learnt the basics of the sitar from Professor Ram Chakravarty, the last sitar player  from Ustad Ashiq Ali Khan&#8217;s gharana in Varanasi. Ashiq Ali Khan Saheb was from the Senia gharana. He shifted to Varanasi and taught numerous disciples like Mushtaq Ali Khan, Amiya Gopal Bhattacharya and others. Ram Chakravarty learnt from Amiya Gopal Babu, and that learning was passed on to Krishna.She also mastered the  playing style of Pandit Ravi Shankar and learnt the finer nuances of the Maihar gharana.Krishna completed her second M.A. in World Music from Wesleyan University, Connecticut, U.S.A.&#8220;Sitar playing can be simple but playing a classical raga like Bhairavi or Sampurna Malkauns in a simpler way is not simple. This simplicity in aesthetics I learnt from Ravi Shankar ji. He simply points out one or two things like the use of meend or andolan, but that creates wonders,&#8221; she says with relish. She has been performing with her sitar for the last four decades as a national artiste. The beauty of her style is that she can establish a raga with the fewest notes. She condemns the present domination of gharanas.&#8220;We find a messy conglomeration of thoughts over the gharanas of instrumental music like Senia, Maihar or Gwalior.Ustad Wazeer Khan of the Senia gharana taught the basics of his or Tansen&#8217;s gharana to Allauddin Khan Saheb and Hafiz Ali Khan Saheb in the same manner on their sarods.Allauddin Saheb shifted to Maihar and Hafiz Ali shifted to Gwalior, and then these places became popular with them respectively as Maihar and Gwalior gharanas, but they are  of the same origins.So we must not forget our aboriginal concerns, otherwise the present-day gharana system will lead us towards confusion,&#8221; she states.This recipient of the Honorary Fellowship of the Alexander Humboldt Foundation (1989) is now teaching in Banaras Hindu University as a professor. Tabla maestros like Pandit Kishan Maharaj, Pandit Samta Prasad Mishra, Ustad Zakir Husain and Shankar Ghosh have accompanied her several times.&#8220;All experiences were great, with tabla accompanists like them. They can beautify a concert with their own creative and humble presence. Kishan Maharaj ji or Samta ji never superimposed their presence on my sitar but accompanied me in a real musical sense,&#8221; she says with appreciation.
