VThe Vyloppilly Samskriti Bhavan, Thiruvananthapuram, was the venue for an  interesting Carnatic music concert led by Aswathy Rama Varma. He was accompanied by seven students of  the Department of Music, University of Kerala &#8211; Aswathy Vinu, Rakhi S. Kumar, Devki Nandakumar, Divyasree G. P., Bijitha M. R., Suja R. Suresh and Sangeetha Manoj.The concert gave a rare opportunity for the seven students to sing with a seasoned vocalist.S.R Vinu on the violin, G. Babu on the mridangam, Adichanalloor Anilkumar on the ghatam and Ananthapadmanabhan on the tanpura complemented the singers.The team had the audience spellbound with their rendering of compositions by Tygaraja, Annamacharya, Swati Tirunal, Muthiah Bhagavathar, Bhadrachalam Ramadas, Prayagarangadas and M. Balamuralikrishna. The concert began with the Aannamacharya composition in Dharmavathi raga, &#8216;Govindashritha gokula brinda.&#8217;&#8216;Nandasutha Thava Jananam,&#8217;  a composition of  Swati Tirunal describing the birth of Lord Krishna, set to Roopaka tala, was sung in Rohini, a ragam created by Dr. Balamuralikrishna.&#8216;Hariye Gathi,&#8217; a ragamalika composition by the maestro, featured Revagupthi, Kamboji, Shudhadhanyasi and Hamsanandi.&#8216;Omkaraharini Madahankara Harini&#8217; in Lavangi was the highlight of the evening. This composition by Dr. Balamuralikrishna is special because &#8216;Lavangi&#8217; is a creation of his genius, as it contains only four swaras.The thaniyavarthanam by G. Babu (mridangam) and Adichanaloor (ghatam) was unique with both the artistes performing &#8216;Konnakol,&#8217;an art of verbalising the tala that is fast vanishing from Carnatic music recitals.The programme consisted of one more composition by Dr. Balamuralikrishna, a thillana in Garudadhwani.The three Tyagaraja pieces were noteworthy as they had a Western classical note to it. &#8216;Varaleelaganalola&#8217; in Sankarabharanam had the audience tapping their feet to the rhythm.The second was the &#8216;Noukacharitram&#8217; composition in Punnagavarali, &#8216;Kandhamu Buyyaruga.&#8217; &#8216;Sarasanethrapara Guna&#8217; in Adi thala displayed the versatility of the vageeyakara.&#8216;Sri Rama Namam&#8217; eulogising the virtues of Lord Rama, a bhajan by  Bhadrachala Ramadas, was sung with devotion.A devotional  composed by Prayaga Rangadasa in scintillating Sindhubhairavi, &#8216;Rama Rama ena Radha,&#8217; added a sublime note to the concert.The next was the &#8216;English Note,&#8217; composed by Harikeshanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar and made famous by Madurai Mani Iyer.The musical feast came to a close with the singing of the mangalam in Yadukulakambodhi- &#8216;Bhujagashayino Nama Mangalam.&#8217;The programme was organised by Thapovan Resort.
