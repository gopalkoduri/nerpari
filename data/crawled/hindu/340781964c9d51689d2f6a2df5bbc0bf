VOn the occasion of Bhagwan Satya Sai Baba's eightieth birthday, many musicians have recorded songs deifying the spiritual leader, paying homage to one whose service to society in multifaceted spheres defies description.Dr. Hiramalini Seshadri, a physician who heals physical ailments, also provides mental solace through her compositions steeped in devotion, and oral rendition that keeps auditory attention riveted. She is ably assisted by Gayatri Venkatesan, whose pleasant voice finds favour with the rasika.The songs in Panthuvarali, Kalyani, Khamas, Kambhoji, Shanmukhapriya Desh, Madhyamavati in Sanskrit, Tamizh, Telugu, Malayalam and Hindi are sincere upsurges of bhakti towards the saint who has touched the lives of millions round the world.In Baba's praisePriya Sisters, Shanmukhapriya and Haripriya, command an impressive devotional repertoire, and their recordings in this genre have received well-merited appreciation.Their audio album for Amutham titled Pavitra Sai in praise of the immortal Shirdi Sai Baba, houses the chant of the Sri Sai Sahasranama stotram, Sadasatswaroopam, Sai Mahima Stotram, an Abang in mahnatti, Namaskarashtakam, Dattatreya stotram, Jaya Jaya deva and an Arathi that powerfully target one's musical and spiritual consciousness.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
