VG. SWAMINATHANSarvani Sangeetha Sabha, an all women-organisation has been conducting  Annamacharya Jayanthi  for the past 18 years.  The sabha presented at the Music Academy mini hall on Sunday last  Vishnubhatla Sisters Saraswathy and Krishnaveni from Vijayawada. The sisters impressed the audience with their good quality and devotion-soaked singing of  Annamacharya kritis.Generally, in the case of duos,  one always has an edge over the other in some aspects. The Vishnubhatla Sisters were no exception, but their voices revealed the same clarity, intensity and tenor. Annamacharya&#8217;s compositions got that special sheen as the  Telugu speaking singers rendered them.Saraswathi and Krishnaveni structured their concert with some popular and many less heard numbers. &#8216;Purushothamaude neevu&#8217; in Bowli gave a solemn start energised by &#8216;Namo namo raghukula nayaka&#8217; in Nattai. The swara sallies  at &#8216;Vihita dharma palaka,&#8217; some of them on the lines of &#8216;Jagada nandakaraka,&#8217; were interesting. The final focus on combinations of jandai and thattu swaras drew encouraging applause from the audience.After &#8216;Chakkani talliki&#8217; in Gowla, came the Hamsanadam number &#8216;Telisithe mokshamu,&#8217; an emotional one. Lalitha made a majestic appearance and assumed an attractive shape in Krishnaveni&#8217;s exposition covering well set phrases of repose and brigas in the right proportion. The famous &#8216;Nata nala brahmayaku&#8217; was their suitable selection.The alapana of the main raga of the evening, Poorvikalyani, was shared by both Saraswathi and Krishnaveni. Although the two voices blended seamlessly, it was Krishnaveni who led the execution with confidence, competence and creativity.B. Ananthakrishnan&#8217;s violin support to a great extent suited the sisters&#8217; style but for his slightly strident deviations in Lalitha. The three percussionists &#8212; BVS Prasad on mridangam, H. Prasanna on the ghatam and A.S.Krishnan on the morsing &#8212; played their parts with understanding and a finely assembled &#8217;thani avartanam&#8217;. It was a good show but one could not help feeling that the inclusion of a few of the Annamacharya numbers popularised by MS would have added merit to the concert.Bottom Template Starts
