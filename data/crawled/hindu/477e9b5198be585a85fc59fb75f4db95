VJ. R. SHRIDHARANThe banner at Alambana'sDil Dhoondtha Hai,a musical journey to the past, brought to fore the popularity of O.P. Nayyar and his contemporaries. Hyderabad-based Prasanna Kumar, a noted singer-cum-music director, enthralled a select audience at Hanumantharaya Grandhalayam with evergreen songs of yesteryear, ranging from ghazals, qawwalis, haunting melodies and peppy numbers. The programme began on a poignant note, with Sailaja rendering O.P. Nayyar's famous compositionAaiye Meharban...from the filmHowrah Bridge.Several up and coming singers like Anwar, Vijay and Vamsi belted out super-hit numbersKya Hua Tera Vada...(Hum Kisise Kam Nahin),Musafir Hu Yaron...(Parichay) andZindagi ke Safar Main...(Aap Ki Kasam). Mayur Orchestra's Mohammad Khaja sprung a surprise by rendering Rafi'sSau Bar Jaan lenge...(Ustadon Ka Ustad).Prasanna Kumar, who was the star attraction, gave the audience an all-new experience by rendering songs of 1950s and the 60s.Playing harmonium with ease, Prasanna obliged several requests from the gathering. He rendered Kundan Lal Saigal'sJab Dil Hi Tootujgaya...much to the delight of the audience. Every song he rendered received overwhelming response, for very rarely such a musical journey to the past takes place in the city.Ghulam Ali's runaway success ghazals such asChupke Chupke...,Hangama hai Kyon...added a dash of variety and so was the racy Holi number fromSilsila&#151;Rang Barse...Prasanna Kumar took the audience by surprise by effortlessly singing Mohammad Rafi'sMadhuban Mein Radhika...fromKohinoor, which is still considered as one of the difficult numbers to render.Playing the role of an interpreter to perfection, Prasanna Kumar, while singing ghazals like Pankaj Udhas'Chitti Ayihai...(Naam) narrated the significance of the words penned by the lyricist by translating them into Telugu.Keyboard player Rakesh from Hyderabad, Mohan (on guitar), Chary (tabla) and Bobby (pads) jelled well with Prasanna by dishing out a perfect orchestration.Bottom Template Starts
