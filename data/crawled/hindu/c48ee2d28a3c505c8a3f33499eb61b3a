VG. SWAMINATHANFor her age Vidya Kalyanaraman holds impressive credentials. Winner of several prizes and scholarships, Vidya has worked diligently to reach this stage and her music spells class. Two popular ragas &#151;  Bhairavi and Kalyani &#151;  were highlighted in her concert at the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam. The selection of songs was off the beaten track: "Alamelu Manga Nee,'' an Annamacharya kriti in Bhairavi and "Nambi Kettavarillavo,'' a Purandaradasa number in Kalyani. Vidya's raga sessions were done with the accent on kaarvai, an admirable trait. Her choice of matured phrases were illuminative of the best parts of Bhairavi.  One, however thought, Kalyani did not get what it deserved &#151;  emphasis on inventive flights, akaras and smooth glides. Thus, a rather plain alapana of Kalyani by Kalyanaraman was taken care of in these aspects on the violin by Srilakshmi Venkataramani.Young practitioners tend to impress with  rapid-fire kalpanaswaras ranging from prosaic to exciting permutations. Vidya was no exception.After long winding notes, Vidya was smart enough  integrate the best combinations reserved for the penultimate or ultimate korvai.  She also made significant forays in Kalyanavasantham ("Nadaloludai'') and Abogi ("Sri Lakshmi Varaham'').Some snagsVidya's concert had certain snags. Her sruti, for instance, dithered in certain places. She recovered quickly and paid greater care to the aspect. Nevertheless, her pitch was a trifle on the higher side and therefore she was tempted to croon rather than sing open-mouthed. Vidya's concert showcased several special compositions like "Tera Deeyaka Rada'' (Gowlibandu) of Tyagaraja, "Damodara Mahe'' (Keeravani) of Narayana Tirtha,  "Venkatasaila Vihara'' (Hameerkalyani) of Subbaraya Sastri and "Parama Purusham'' (Lalithapanjamam) by Swati Tirunal. Srilakshmi Venkataramani played her part on the violin with balanced perception. Nellai Balaji and Nanganallur Swaminathan on the mridangam and ghatam played with gusto throughout the concert.Bottom Template Starts
