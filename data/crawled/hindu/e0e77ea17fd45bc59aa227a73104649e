VIt is a bone of contention among discerning lovers of Carnatic music whether a violin &#8216;solo&#8217; should be presented with an individual stamp of the maestro or played with the traces of vocal styles imbibed through accompanying master vocalists of yesteryear.When T.N. Krishnan plays the violin during a solo, there is the predominant echo of the titans of the past and the melody is enhanced by  his immaculate  bowing technique.Although TNK looked a bit tired, his concert,  organised by Rasikapriya in Kochi,  transported  listeners to a world of pristine music, devoid of any gimmicks.A glistening Chakravaakam found its ultimate expression in Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8216;Gajaananayutham.&#8217;&#8216;Poorvikalyani,&#8217; ornate with wide sweeps and meticulous finger control, got a long applause. &#8216;Jnaanamu,&#8217; composed by Tyagaraja was adorned with  kalpana swaras  in vivid patterns. The delineation of Mukhari was typical of TNK in his halcyon days with the &#8216;jeevan&#8217; of the raga throbbing in each and every draw of the bow.The Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Ksheenamai&#8217; also won the accolades of the audience. A brief but lilting sketch of Sahana with &#8216;Vandanamu,&#8217; again a Tyagaraja kriti, was followed by an opulent Thodi, paving the way for a pallavi woven into Behaag, Kapi and Maanji.Although he wound up the concert quite early,  the brevity was compensated by quality. Trichur K.M.S.Mani accompanied on the mridanagam and Tripunithura Radhakrishnan on the ghatom.
