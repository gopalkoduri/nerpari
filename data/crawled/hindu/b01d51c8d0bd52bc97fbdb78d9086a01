VIt was a befitting finale to the Spic-Macay's Music in the Park series &#8211; with performance by the renowned vocalist duo Rajan-Sajan Mishra this past week in New Delhi's Nehru Park. The brothers belong to a well-known musician family of Banaras and have learnt from their father Hanuman Prasad Mishra and uncle Gopal Mishra, both of whom were sarangi players. Of them, Gopal Mishra had become a legend in his lifetime and was considered to be a great master of the instrument. As is well known, sarangi comes closest to the human voice and can reproduce almost everything related to vocal music. Rajan Mishra and his younger brother Sajan Mishra were fortunate enough to learn from the doyen of Banaras gharana Bade Ramdas Mishra too, thus imbibing the core values of their gharana and acquiring its priceless traditional compositions.Eschewing gharana orthodoxy, the Mishra brothers have fashioned their style of singing by successfully blending varied influences into it. No wonder that today they rank among the most popular and successful vocalists of Hindustani classical music. Another reason behind their success is the perfect understanding between the two brothers. One is truly amazed at the ease with which they seamlessly merge their separate identities into an organic whole, thus making the listener feel as if it is a single-singer performance and not a jugalbandi.Haunting BihagRajan Mishra and Sajan Mishra made an appropriate choice by opening their concert with a haunting Bihag and sang a Sadarang composition set to vilambit (slow) Ek tala &#8220;Jag Jeevan Thora, Samajh Boojh Ab Dekhle.&#8221; They methodically elaborated the raga and accorded due importance to gandhar and nishad. Their vocal activity in the lower register was particularly absorbing as were their meends. They offered an unhurried account of this enchanting melody and sang a madhyalaya Teen tala composition &#8220;Jasumati Jhulave Lalna Palna&#8221;, followed by a drut Teen tala bandish &#8220;Ab Lalan Maika&#8221;. Their recital was replete with well-formed gamak taans and chhoot taans and had both grace and lilt. Their tremendous taiyaari was there for all to see. However, one could notice the creeping in of certain repetitive phrases too.In view of the still-lingering spring season, the Mishra brothers sang with great aplomb two shringar-laden compositions in Teen tala &#8211; &#8220;Ae Ri Aaee Ri Ritu Naveli Khelo Basant&#8221; and &#8220;Kahe Ab Tum Aaye Ho&#8221;. They rounded off their recital with a khayal-ang tarana in the same raga, drawing rapturous applause from the audience. Akram Khan of Ajrada-Meerut gharana impressed on tabla and so did Sumit Mishra on harmonium.Earlier, the evening opened with a scintillating mandolin recital in the Carnatic style by U. Srinivas, a child prodigy who has now matured into a seasoned musician.
