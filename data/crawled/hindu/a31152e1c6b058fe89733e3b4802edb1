VPraise and worship songs are a big hit with everyone these days and more so with youngsters. The genre immediately evokes sounds of pulsating rhythm, guitar grooves and rock-based tunes. &#8216;Adonai, wasikiren Umakkaga' is a praise and worship album in Tamil where the tunes and lyric are by young Arpana Sharon, who has also rendered all the nine songs.&#8216;Ekkala Satham' is a medley which exudes power. Joel, Rohit, Ramya and Lawrence Satriani provide subtle backing vocals. The singer recalls how she was healed by God in &#8216;Naan Nirkiren.'Folksy number&#8216;Pudhu Ennaiyaal' finds Sharon addressing the listener every now. &#8216;Yesu Ennai' is a happy folksy number, while the title song is done imaginatively. Kudos to the young Theology student for her major work! The range of the songs is a little limited and the key to the songs is set low and hence doesn't easily allow the listener to sing along. It may be a good idea if the young composer would consider this factor in her next venture and opt to sing in a higher pitch.K. Sam has taken care of the music, and the orchestration is trendy and will appeal to the youth. The guitar work of Amalraj and Keba adds zing to the CD.For details, contact 94455 38969, 98845 55164, 98849 69938.
