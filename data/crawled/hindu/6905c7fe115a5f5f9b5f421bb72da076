VT. K. GANAPATHYThe hype generated before the vocal recital of P. Unnikrishnan was not matched by the fare he provided on the concluding day of the Pongal Music Festival at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Coimbatore. It was a pedestrian affair. His forays into tinseldom have made him a crowd puller.  He started his kutcheri with the Pantuvarali varnam, but the majestic gait was missing."Sivagamasundari" in Jaganmohini and "Brochevaarevarura" in Kamas measured up to the required standard but without any aesthetic feeling. Though the fluidity of his vocal movements was not missing in his alapana of Shanmukhapriya for the kriti, "Aandavane Unai Nambinen," it was a tame presentation. "Palukavemi" (Purnachandrika) and "Rajagopalam Bhajeham" (Mohanam), both garnished with swaras, did not rise to  classic heights. His RTP in Bhairavi for "Thaamarasadalanetri" and the sancharas in Ritigowla, Surutti, Maalgosh, Ranjani and Kaapi did not move out of traditional boundaries.Hasty renditionsThe tukkadas towards the end were hasty renditions. At the end of it all, the listener felt that there was only a musical appearance rather than depth.Vittal Ramamurthi's soft melody from the strings of his violin was a winner all the way. Harikumar (mridangam) and Purushothaman (kanjira) were vibrant in their percussion support.Bottom Template Starts
