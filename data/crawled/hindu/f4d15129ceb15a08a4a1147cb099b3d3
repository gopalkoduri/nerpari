VSwami Haridhos Giri was the prime sishya of Swami Gnanananda Giri who was sixth  in the line of descendants of the Sankara Jyotish Math. He, like his preceptor, propagated the efficacy of namasankeertanam in man's quest for divine benediction. His devotional programmes drew bhaktas like  iron filings to a magnet.Thousands of devotees thronged  his Radha Kalyana Utsavams conducted from the year 1990. Many leading vidwans  took great pride and joy in participating in these programmes. This DVD album is a live recording of the Utsavam; and meticulous care has been taken to ensure the audio and visual quality.The powerful, felicitous, magnetic voice of Sri Haridhos Giri chanting the sacred names of the Lord with the ardent devotees joining in the chorus creates an ambience beyond description. The celestial wedding with Jayadeva and Padmavati as the parents of the bride Radha, is conducted in great style and splendour.The detailed portrayal of all the auspicious rituals including `Sobhanam, Oonjal' and the crowning glory of the `Thirumangalyadharanam' leaves the viewer in a state of trance. Swamiji's lecture on different social issues, religious tolerance and total surrender to the Supreme Being, besides having a resounding on the devotee's mindset also brings to mind the Sanskrit proverb, "The cow is drawn by music, the child is lulled by it, the man who does not feel the power of music is only an animal without a tail." This volume would be an excellent, enriching addition to the believer's collection.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
