VOnly people who are rooted in Bangalore know how the Garden City rocks with rock, parties at pubs, celebrates tradition with Bangalore Habba, unites magically in a fusion concert and yet is zealously rooted in Indian classical music!Take Carnatic and Hindustani genres for instance. &#8220;It&#8217;s like the State&#8217;s staple &#8216;Bisibelebath&#8217;. Can we expect the mushrooming all-Indian and Continental restaurants to weed this taste out?&#8221; reasons the Carnatic music doyen R.K. Srikantan. &#8220;Cosmopolitan Bangalore resonates with Carnatic and Hindustani music with serious music sabhas and cultural organisations, mandalis and academies being active in almost every area. Aren&#8217;t such traditional pursuits commendable for a city that has a parallel fetish for fashion and food?&#8221; asks the doyen.The city has nearly 60 sabhas promoting classical music, apart from 35 other organisations choosing important festivals for running a parallel concert series. There are a few notable ones whose efficiency and reputation for focussed work has helped their concerts during Ramanavami, Janmashtami, Ganesha Chaturthi, Shivarathri and Ugadi into institutions in themselves.. &#8220;Devotional bhajans were what festival celebrations in the city initially started with and over the years it created a platform for the classical genre,&#8221; says S.V. Raghavendra of Ananya Cultural Academy. &#8220;We shouldn&#8217;t forget a key aspect here. Only because there were serious takers for the classical genres did Carnatic and Hindustani concerts on such occasions get popular.&#8221;Mridangist H.S. Sudhindra was so overwhelmed with the wide reach of classical music in the city that he came up with the &#8220;Directory of Karnatak Musicians&#8221;, in its fourth edition this year. This information bank, with a startling 2,800 listings spread over 60 categories, gives one an idea of the thriving music scene in the city. &#8220;There are Sabha concerts, festival celebrations with music, Government sponsored concerts and New Year specials that nearly add up to 1,400 kutcheris a year, apart from other recordings and marriage concerts that rank Bangalore high in classical music appreciation,&#8221; feels Sudhindra.Such a rich and vibrant musical presence is not something entirely new in this part of the country. The Mysore Maharajas were well-known patrons of pure classical genres, nurturing musicians and composers in the royal courts.&#8220;Also, several researches have pointed out that there were about 400 Haridasas in Karnataka who poured out their spiritual experiences in lyrical form in the 15th and 16th Centuries. Although only about 10 per cent may be popular in music platforms today, our State has been a rich repository of culture,&#8221; says Carnatic vocalist Mysore Nagamani Srinath who has just released a twin audio-disc &#8216;Haridaasa Deepthi&#8217; containing 101 Dasarapadas.Bangalore has more than 50 colleges of music imparting classical music lessons, and there continues to be a high demand for their learning. &#8220;Professional teachers and frontline performers are too busy to take in new students. Since there is appreciable music penetration in society, most institutions are filled to their maximum,&#8221; says Sudhindra, whose Suswaralaya College of Music has 35 students.&#8220;Music is in our city&#8217;s veins,&#8221; says H.K. Venkatram of Vijaya College of Music. &#8220;In a cosmopolitan Bangalore where Hindustani, jazz, sugama sangeetha and rock vie for equal space, the spread of Carnatic music has been an upbeat story. Thanks to the reality shows on TV, there is a rush of students in music schools today,&#8221; he says.The Anoor family of musicians contribution to the teaching scene in the city can&#8217;t be ignored. The fourth generation of musicians Anoor Dattatreya Sharma and Anoor Anantakrishna Sharma now run the Ayyanar Music College with a deeply rooted family motto of imparting music lessons and propagating the cause of music selflessly.As much as one would like to generalise that classical music has taken a backseat, blaming Westernisation, lack of interest among the younger generation, or lack of an appreciative audience, the city has unrelentingly proven such doomsayers wrong.
