He began the concert with an Ata tala varnam &#8216;Neranamithi' by Ramanathapuram Sreenivasa Iyengar in Kanada. Shashank chose Poorvikalyani as the main raga. The ragavisthara was elaborate, moving fluently in three octaves. After the thanam, the pallavi was his own composition. Enchanting swaraprasthara was followed by ragamalika in Panthuvarali, Surutti and Malayamarutham. Thiruvizha Viju S. Anand followed him effectively on the violin. The taniavarthanam by Parippalli S. Phalgun (mridangam) and Tripunithura N. Radhakrishnan (ghatam) took the concert to great heights.Spiritual journeyHindustani vocalist Ramesh Narayan began his concert with an alaap in Madhuvanthi raag followed by a short Hindustani kriti.

His wife, Hema Narayan, and daughter Madhuvanthi Narayan, provided vocal support. &#8216;Nirvanashtakam,' a lyric in praise of Lord Shiva rendered in Darbari Kanada by Ramesh Narayan, sent the audience on a spiritual journey.
