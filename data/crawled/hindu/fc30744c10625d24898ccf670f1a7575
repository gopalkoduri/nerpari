VG. SWAMINATHANThis had been the ideal ambience for a concert until early last century in the southern part of India. Temple was where connoisseurs collected to listen and enjoy music and dance. One was transported to that era as one attended the Vidaiyetri Festival at the Sri Parthasarathy Swami Temple.The utsava moorthy beautifully decorated was atop the mandapam and the performers Kadri Gopalnath and Kanyakumari with their accompanists sat a few steps below. The audience at the initial stage was sparse but swelled as the performance progressed.Scheduled to begin at 7 p.m., the programme began a little late. The grand Mallari kept the audience captivated with its majesty and beauty. The music used especially for the invocation of the deity was performed, complete with all the permutations and combinations of different nadais. Kadri&#8217;s saxophone captured the magnificence of nagaswaram.But the real surprise came from violin wizard Kanyakumari. One had to wonder when she projected certain phrases on the violin whether she was playing on a string instrument or another wind instrument. What versatility and control!Instrumentalists generally enjoy that extra freedom in manodharma and some do indulge in flamboyance. The audience wants it and likes it. The artistes did not disappoint them that evening. Gopalnath and Kanyakumari vied with each other almost at every step to indulge in musical acrobatics &#8212; they sprinted, soared, leaped, somersaulted, twisted and turned.With the result the ragas were explosions than expositions, niravals were incredible extrapolations rather than embellishments and swaras were sheer roller coaster affairs rather than aesthetic attachments. In the last segment it was endless swaras of different lengths and rounds culminating in a dramatic and thunderous denouement. All these were for &#8216;Devadi Deva&#8217; in Sunadavinodhini and the inimitable &#8217;Nagumomu&#8217; in Aberi where indeed the scope was abundant.In such musical extravaganzas, percussion artistes invariably have a ball. So Patri Satish Kumar created powerful beats on the thavil instead of mridangam ably pampered by B.S. Purushothaman on the kanjira and B. Rajasekar on the morsing.O.S.Arun has definitely evolved a style for himself &#8212; dramatised articulation supported by gestures form his medium of communication. Because of this even his vocal shortcomings get compensated by gesticulations, which convey &#8216;something&#8217; to the audience. Further, he has created a place in his programmes especially for bhajans.So his &#8216;bhajan yatra&#8217; at the Parthasarathy temple initially covered a few kritis in Carnatic style and the major portion was saved for bhajans and short numbers. The Carnatic segment has some catchy songs such as &#8216;Aadinaye salangai,&#8217; a lilting one in Mohanam and a detailed &#8216;Parthasarathy nannu&#8217; in Madhyamavati. Bhajans are normally more emotive, simple and infectious. &#8216;Theertha vittala kshetra vittala&#8217; on the Bindumalini raga lines was emotionally high voltage; the fast refrain &#8216;Vittala Vittala&#8217; reverberated through the walls of the temple in Arun&#8217;s booming voice with the frenzied support by the violin, mridangam and tabla. True, there were sober numbers like Annamacharya&#8217;s &#8216;Muddugare Yashoda&#8217; (Kurinji) and &#8217;Kali premem maadalaye&#8217; to name a few. And the Chennai rasiaks lapped it all up, the oppressive heat and the humid mandapam notwithstanding.Bottom Template Starts
