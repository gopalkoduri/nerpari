VHe tuned his way into everyone's hearts, with a resonant voice whose tone and timbre is something to write home about. O.S. Arun's Bhajan Sandhya was an evening of all-pervading music beginning with two devotionals on Ganesha &#8212; Jai Gananaya, Sri Gananaya which abates with &#8216;Ganapathi boppa moriya' while the Ganesha, Ganesha nama om, a fast track which picks up momentum as it winds its way upwards in typical bhajan fashion. The musician's penchant to keep his diction pure whatever the language is one of the many plus points of his rendition. Arun does not let go his classical base and learning, even if he is totally into &#8216;devotionals'. There is use of manodharma, gamakam, neraval and other finer technicalities. But his dexterity lies in using these without making his rendition sound like a Carnatic vocal concert. There is no heavy inflow of swarakalpana or tala, nadai intricacies, and neither can it be termed light casual singing. He brings in his brand of rendition with voice sonority that lends depth to any kind of singing. At many places &#8212; gimmicks, gestures and vocal play &#8212; Arun seems a la Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna in his younger days. At times, his exuberance went a little over the top. A piece of sahityam is tossed to and fro and brought back to the ground with inimitable deftness. His repertoire on the bhajan side is phenomenal. And no two pieces were sung in the same manner. That is O.S. Arun for you.In the Brindavana sanchari Shyamagopala he used the neraval technique with style while his voice literally went into a swinging mode in rendering the &#8216;jhule' line. The Sarvajana prayer song was ultimate in its reverberation of God's name as spelt out in each religion.His calling out to &#8216;Allah' resembled the &#8216;Azaan' (call for prayer at mosques) while &#8216;Nanak' sounded very Punjabi and a deep throated &#8216;Yesu' along with a profound &#8216;Hari' was something only a person of Arun's calibre could attain.The Meera bhajan Payo ji maine Ram rattan dhan payo, was excellent with a very Hindustani touch and the use of srothovaha yati (ascending order of lyrical notes).Muddugare Yashoda was a little shaky in diction but well dealt. Shambho, Shiva Shambo (Revathi) was a power packed presentation where the stress on the right syllable lifted the entire presentation to different heights. The percussion lent a further impetus at this point.The Vishama kara kannan in Tamil skipped like a rivulet in full force. Garuda gamana ra ra, a Ramadas keertana, and Tulasidas' Sri Ramachandra kripala bhajana were by far the best, with a sweetness in the singing. An abhang piece in Marathi was as chaste as it should be while the Guruvandana Satya Sai and a few others like Anupama sundarananda were dedicated to Satya Saibaba whose birthday celebrations marked this music concert at Shivam. The percussionists along with Krishnan on the harmonium were assets to the vocalist.
