VThe Nadaranjani Sangeetha Sabha, Bangalore, hosted a vocal concert recently by Shriranjani and Shruthiranjani, accompanied by Aditi Krishnaprakash (violin), Ranjani Venkatesh (mridanga), and Bhagyalakshmi Krishna (morsing).A varna in Ranjini raga and aditala, sung in two speeds with an intervening tishra gathi, preceded a short sketch of Natta and a spirited &#8220;Raksha Mam Sharanagatham&#8221;, a composition of Meenakshisutha in adi tala, ornamented with some fluent kalpana swaras that balanced the soft voices of the artistes with energetic articulation and demeanour.While the sedate cadence and lilting beauty of Deekshithar's &#8220;Akhilandeshwari&#8221; in Dwijavanthi raga and aditala provided a sharp contrast to the previous item, Thyagaraja's &#8220;Tulasidalamulache&#8221; in Mayamalavagoula and rupaka tala ushered in yet another change in tempo and colour. The compact, but well-sculpted neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Saraseeruha Punnaga&#8221; in the latter were commensurate with the positioning of the composition in the format of the current concert.A bracing &#8220;Chenthane Sada&#8221; in Kunthalavarali raga and adi tala prefaced a comprehensive alapana of Vachaspathi that emphasised the softer shades of the raga.A plethora of explorative sancharas in the three octaves revealed fine improvisational skills and commendable coordination between the duo, with one taking over from the other in seamless continuity. An excellent rendition of &#8220;Emani Delupudura&#8221;, a composition of Veene Sheshanna set to aditala, was reinforced by a neraval and kalpana swaras that ended with a spell of diminishing tala cycles ending at the dhaivatha, and a fairly detailed tani avartana.Deekshithar's &#8220;Rangapuravihara&#8221; in Brindavana Saranga and rupaka tala led to the main focus of the evening, a raga tana pallavi in Keeravani. The alapana was melodious and perfectly aligned to shruthi, punctuated with occasional plain notes, brighas and gliding passages that touched many facets of the raga, but appeared rather rushed given the importance of the item.The tanam, also abbreviated, was followed by a demanding avadhana pallavi beginning &#8220;Rave Balambike&#8221; set to the traditional sampadveshtaka and raja talas with identical time spans but different distribution of components or angas, calling for a high degree of physical and mental coordination. The expansion of the pallavi attested to a relentless grip over the improvisational and laya aspects and included some of the mandatory rhythmic variations, augmented by tuneful and prompt accompaniment from the violinist and excellent anticipation and expertise from the percussionists. The ensuing kalpana swaras also featured ragamalika swaras in Shahana, Behag and Revathi.
