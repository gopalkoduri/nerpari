VRain or shine, one organisation strives to liven up the spirits of Carnatic music rasikas by periodically arranging concerts throughout the year in the Capital.  True to its reputation, Gayathri Fine Arts recently presented an upcoming duo, M.B. Hari\u000aharan and S. Ashok of Bangalore, as part of their Annual Festival. The two singers, in their concert of close to two hours, delighted  listeners with  some impressive renderings. At the outset, the efforts of this organisation, and in particular  of its General Secretary N.A. Ramachandran,  who  turned 82  on the day of this concert, deserve to be appreciated.Hariharan and Ashok began their concert with an impressive Adi tala varnam in  raga Abhogi. The duo then presented  Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8220;Guruvayurappa&#8221; in the raga Chakravakam. This piece was preceded by a  viruttam and followed by crisp swaraprastaras. Their rendering of &#8220;Devadhi Deva&#8221;, a composition of Mysore Vasudevacharya in the raga Sunadavinodini, was scintillating.The singers  gave a good account of themselves when they presented Tyagaraja&#8217;s kriti &#8220;Suthamurare&#8221; in the raga Arabhi. Earlier, Ashok presented a fine alap of this raga, bringing  the raga bhava to the fore. The duo also presented swaraprastaras towards the end that were rich in creativity. Purandaradasa&#8217;s fast tempo &#8220;Simha rupa&#8221; in  raga Kedaram was lively and impressive.These two artistes are known as the Bangalore Brothers  though they are not siblings. Having learnt music from different gurus individually, they have now come together under  the tutelage of H.S. Sudhindra of Bangalore. It was he who  coined the title &#8216;Bangalore Brothers&#8217; for them. Both of them have also been under the tutelage of Salem P. Sundaresan.As a main item of their concert, Hariharan and Ashok presented &#8220;Sri Krishnam Bajamanasa&#8221; in the raga Todi. The presentation was marked by an outstanding alap  by Hariharan, delineating it  in stages and aesthetically bringing  the raga bhava to the fore. The composition as such was well handled and the subsequent niraval of the phrase &#8220;Sanga chakraka dha padmavana malam&#8221; from the charanam of the composition and the culminating swaraprastaras were handled creatively.Delhi&#8217;s V.S.K. Chakrapani on the violin, K. N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam and Mannai N. Kannan on the ghatam provided understanding, encouraging and excellent support throughout. While Chakrapani&#8217;s delineation of  raga Todi was delightful, he also brought out some impressive swaraprastaras in the ragas Chakravakam and Arabhi. The tani avartanam (rhythm solo) of Padmanabhan and Kannan in Adi tala was enjoyable.Gayathri Fine Arts  also  provides a platform to young talents. Master Dinesh N. Swamy got  one such opportunity, and his flute concert preceded the concert of the Bangalore brothers. Though the time slot given to Dinesh was only half-an-hour, he gave a good account of himself within duration.He presented three songs, Dikshitar&#8217;s &#8220;Vatapi ganapathim&#8221; in the raga Hamsadhwani, Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Sobillu saptaswaram&#8221; and &#8220;Brovabharama&#8221; in  raga Bahudari, all of which were impressive. R. Saravanan provided encouraging support on the violin, and Master B. Manohar provided excellent support on the mridangam. His tani avartanam even in this short short duration concert was captivating.
