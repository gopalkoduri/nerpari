VSenior vocalist S. Shankar accompanied by B. Raghuram(violin), N. Vasudev (mridanga), L. Bhimachar (morching) and S. Ramani (vocal support) presented a concert at the MES Kalavedi, last weekend in Bangalore.The performance commenced with Mysore Vasudevacharya&#8217;s adi tala varna in Kanada, &#8220;Varanasyam Pranamami&#8221;. While the positioning of Swathi Tirunal&#8217;s &#8220;Pankajalochana&#8221; in Kalyani and misra chapu tala as the second item of the evening was a surprise, the restrained alapana, the immaculate rendering of the krithi, neraval and kalpana swaras, validated the choice. A complete change of ambience was accomplished with the ethereal quality of Deekshithar&#8217;s &#8220;Hiranmayeem Lakshmeem&#8221; set to Lalitha raga and rupaka tala.&#8220;Meevallagunadosha&#8221;, preceded by an abbreviated alapana of Kapi, was notable for the relaxed kalapramana that underlined the inherent beauty of the composition, followed by &#8220;Needayarada&#8221; in Vasanthabhairavi and Syama Sastri&#8217;s &#8220;Brovavamma&#8221; in Manji. The elaborate alapana of Kamboji, followed by the magnificent &#8220;O Rangasayee&#8221;, and neraval at &#8220;Bhuloka Vaikuntham&#8221;, were evident of S. Sankar&#8217;s erudition, sense of proportion and aesthetic sensibilities, honed by long years of experience. B. Raghuram&#8217;s violin accompaniment remained faithful to the style and intent of the main artiste in all respects. Several cycles of kalpana swaras of one avarthana each in the first speed, and a few of diminishing length ending at the dhaivatha in the second speed, alternated between the lead vocalist, the violinist and the support vocalist, and culminated in an engrossing tani avarthana.&#8220;Bhavayami Raghuramam&#8221; (ragamalika), and a few smaller pieces led to the concluding item, the exquisite &#8220;Mangalam Bhavatute Bharatajanani&#8221; in Hamir Kalyani.* * *A vocal recital by Vani Sateesh, accompanied by Nalina Mohan (violin), H.S. Sudhinra (mridanga) and B. Gururaja (morching) was held at the Sri Rama Lalitha Kala Mandir on Sunday.The artiste&#8217;s most striking asset was undoubtedly her naturally rich and pliable voice, which she used to admirable advantage throughout the concert. The Hamsadhwani varna in adi tala was followed by &#8220;Thulasidalamulache&#8221; in Mayamalavagoula, with well-ordered neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Sarasiruhapunnaga&#8221;, and &#8220;Vanchathonu&#8221;, Muthaiah Bhagavathar&#8217;s hauntingly beautiful krithi in Karnaranjani.Vani&#8217;s alapana of Bilahari encompassed a plethora of heavy gamakas as well as fast briga based passages, and while the undeterred flow of manodharma was remarkable, a slightly more tranquil and systematic approach would have drawn out the essence of the raga more effectively. &#8220;Sri Chamundeswari&#8221; in adi tala was sung with adequate stress on its lyrical beauty, especially in the neraval at &#8220;Rakanisakara Sannibhavadane&#8221;. &#8220;Ninna Manade&#8221; in Madhuvanti, was presented with emotional intensity and exceptional voice control.A brisk &#8220;Nenarunchinanu&#8221;, Thyagaraja&#8217;s composition in Malavi, was succeeded by a raga tana pallavi in Kalyani. The detailed alapana traversed the octaves up to the tara panchama effortlessly and the tana had both depth and variety. The pallavi had the  diligent support from Nalina Mohan, and imaginative interaction between the percussionists during the tani avarthana.The concert concluded with a fine rendition of the ragamalika devaranama, &#8220;Manave Manthralaya&#8221;.
