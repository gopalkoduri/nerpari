VAllied Ragas-8 on Mohanam and Mohanakalyani, part of a monthly thematic series conducted by Ananya, Bangalore, was presented recently by vocalist Dr. Sukanya Prabhakar, accompanied by Mysore R. Dayakar (violin) and B.K. Chandramouli (mridanga).The audava-audava structure of Mohanam, the older of the two ragas, and the audava-sampoorna structure of Mohanakalyani were clearly explained, and it was emphasised that while the name of the latter raga occurs in certain early musical treatises, it refers in fact to the basic scale of Mohanam itself incorporating some vakra usages. Despite similarities in the arohana, the categorisation of Mohanam as a janya of Harikamboji, and of Mohanakalyani as a derivative of Mechakalyani, was mentioned, and its origin traced to Swathi Tirunal. A variety of compositions in Mohanam by several vaggeyakaras were cited, including Thyagaraja, Deekshithar, Swathi Tirunal and several of the great Mysore composers, and in Mohanakalyani by Swathi Tirunal, Muthaiah Bhagavathar and others.The sweet classicism, and the strength of the gandhara and dhaivatha in Mohanam, were demonstrated through enchanting renditions of Oothukkadu Venkatasubbier's &#8220;Swagatham Krishna&#8221;, Pallavi Gopalayyar's &#8220;Shree Rama Ramani Manohara&#8221;, adorned with a spacious neraval and kalpana swaras, &#8220;Rara Rajeevalochana Rama&#8221;, also supplemented with a neraval and kalpana swaras, the bhajan &#8220;Giridhar Gopala&#8221;, a devaranama and vachana. The softness of notes and smoothness of sancharas in Mohanakalyani were amply illustrated through a string of krithis including Swathi Thirunal's &#8220;Seve Sreekantham&#8221;, Prof. R.N. Doreswamy's exquisite &#8220;Sangeetha Sahithya&#8221;, and Mysore Vasudevacharya's thillana, interspersed with the artiste's erudite comments on the lakshana and lakshya aspects of both ragas.A vocal concert by S. Shankar, accompanied by S. Ramani (vocal support), Mathur R. Srinidhi (violin) and C. Cheluvaraju (mridanga) was hosted by the Rajamahal Vilas Sangeetha Sabha.A mellifluous start was made with &#8220;Vanajakshi&#8221;, the atta tala varna in Kalyani, and the artiste's own composition &#8220;Sree Mahaganapathim&#8221; set to Andolika raga and adi tala. Thyagaraja's &#8220;Meru Samana&#8221; in Mayamalavagaula raga and adi tala was rendered next in a mellow tempo, bedecked with an evocative neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8220;Alakala Muddunu&#8221;. A gamaka laden &#8220;Brovavamma&#8221;, Shyama Shastri's composition in Manji raga and mishra chapu tala, was followed by well sculpted and bhava infused elaboration of Lathangi. Patnam Subrahmanya Iyer's &#8220;Marivere Dikkevvaru&#8221; in khanda chapu thala was augmented with a lively neraval and kalpana swaras in two speeds.&#8220;Aparadhamulanorva&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in Rasali and adi tala was prelude to a succinct alapana of Karaharapriya that illumined the beauty of the raga through a series of fluid phrases that traversed the three octaves effortlessly. Thyagaraja's &#8220;Rama Nee Samanamevaru&#8221; in rupaka tala featured an alluring neraval at &#8220;Paluku Palukulaku&#8221;, including the entire sahithya up to &#8220;sodarulu&#8221;, thereby ensuring that the import of the lyrics was conveyed in greater measure, with exemplary support from the accompanying artistes. Fairly elaborate kalpana swaras, ending with a spell of diminishing avarthanas around the dhaivatha, culminated in a masterly yet proportionate thani avarthana.The ensuing items included a ragamalika shloka beginning &#8220;Thamarasadala Nayana&#8221;, set to Ahirbhairav, Hindolam and Saveri, leading up to a superb rendition of Swathi Thirunal's &#8220;Bhavayami Raghuramam&#8221;.
