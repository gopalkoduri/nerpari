VTHE SIXTH day of the music festival, organised by Rajalakshmi fine arts, Coimbatore, featured the vocal concert of Aruna Sayeeram, whose great asset is her voice.  Her opening Lalgudi varnam in Charukesi was a winsome presentation.After an enthusiastic rendition of "Kaa Vaa Vaa" in Varali, a brigha-studded alapana of Kalyani was followed by an enlivening picture of "Madhava hrdi khelini," one of the saptaratnas of Oothukadu Venkata Kavi.The very familiar, "Samajavaragamana" in Hindolam with an interesting combination of swaras registered well with the listeners.Kshtragnar's padam, Payyada in Nadanamakriya was projected with subtle nuances.The piece-de-resistance of the recital was her strident voice making melodic improvisations in the comprehensive raga alapana of Bhairavi in the RTP exercise for the Pallavi, `Murugane Guhane.'A vibrant Abhang of Namdev was a fitting finale to the entire rhythmic fare.Raghavendra Rao demonstrated his prowess all through complementing the artiste in style. J. Vaidyanathan (mridangam) and Ramani (ghatam) together provided nadai variations and interesting laya patterns in their tani.T. K. GANAPATHYBottom Template Starts
