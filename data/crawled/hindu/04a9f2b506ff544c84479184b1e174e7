VLALITHAA KRISHNANYour first thought on listening to Udayalur K. Kalyanarama Bhagavathar sing would be that this is one vocalist who ought to grace the ranks of present day frontline Carnatic musicians. Then you realise that in following his heart and pledging allegia\u000ance to the Bhajana Sampradaya, the artiste has made the perfect choice as this genre provides the most complete opportunity for his passionate no-holds-barred exploration of bhava through both sahitya and melody, unfettered by the more formal demands of a kutcheri.The artiste expressed his gratitude to his gurus, Sethalapathy Balasubramaniam and Dharmapuri Swaminathan and thanked the Parthasarathy Swami Sabha and the Saraswathi Vaggeyakara Trust for the unique opportunity to render namasankirtana based exclusively on Tamil compositions.Stirring verses from several great oeuvres including the Tiruppugazh, Tiruvachagam and Tiru Arutpa vied in expressive content, sweeping the listeners into an upsurge of devotional outpouring. Vocal support was provided by Balasubramaniam, Pichumani Bhagavathar and Ravi with Mullaivasal G. Chandramouli on the violin and Babu Rajasekaran on the mridangam.One of the vocalist&#8217;s prime strengths is his instinctive understanding of gamakas and their myriad nuances, whether in the definitive pidis of rakthi ragas or the flowing graces of light melodies.  Add to that a full-throated resonant voice that effortlessly navigates crests and troughs at will along with a clear enunciation of sahitya and you have music that is as mesmerising as it is uplifting.The artiste&#8217;s yen for classic turn of phrase was in evidence right through the delineations in Thodi, Charukesi, Rithigowla and Kharaharapriya. The verse &#8216;Mann Kanda Venkudaikku&#8217; drawn from Kumaraguruparar&#8217;s &#8216;Sakalakalavalli Maalai&#8217; made a grand entry at the tharasthayi shadja suite in Thodi, aglitter with brilliant facets.The sharp poignancy of Charukesi was captured in the melodic phrase &#8217;M...grsd&#8217; articulated with a wealth of feeling in stanzas from Ramalinga Swami&#8217;s &#8216;Tiru Arutpa&#8217; followed by Tirunavukkarasar&#8217;s &#8216;Thirutthandavam&#8217;. Again subtle variations of light and shade lent changing hues to Kharaharapriya in which verses from Kumaraguruparar&#8217;s Meenakshi Ammai Pillai Thamizh&#8217; were rendered.Imaginative swirls emerged in &#8216;Naane unai nambinen&#8217; (Amrithavarshini) while simple effective sangathis captured the charm of Hindolam, Mohanam, Kanada and Revathi in other compositions.There was a wonderfully emotive feel to the seamless linking of ragas such as Kapi and Sindubhairavi in the ragamalika viruttams. Mullaivasal G. Chandramouli came up with spontaneous and appealing portrayals of Rithigowla, Kharaharapriya and Amrithavarshini which elicited open appreciation from main artiste and rasika alike. Babu Rajasekaran&#8217;s mridangam accompaniment carried punch and thrust.Bottom Template Starts
