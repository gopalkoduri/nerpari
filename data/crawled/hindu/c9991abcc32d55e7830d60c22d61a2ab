VThese valuable traits found ample scope in the programme of P. Vasanthakumar in his Krishna Gana Sabha concert. This was part of the Navarathri Veena festival organised by the Veena Foundation of New Delhi. The co-sponsors included the Krishna Gana Sabha.The quality of his exposition was instinctively connected to his subjective vision. The appeal came through the quiet flow of well-nourished musical process. The first introductory phrasing before the Varali varnam had flair and substance.Without much ado the varnam revealed refinement as its corner-stone. The Sriraga composition of Dikshitar &#8220;Sri Moolaadhara&#8221; defined that refinement has to underline tranquillity.The first raga essay was Dhanyasi (&#8220;Balakrishnan-Paada-Malar). The compelling resonances of Dhanyasi sancharas, clipped and built around, pauses with precision, enriched the raga&#8217;s stature. The sanchara arrangement emphasised how crispness and depth contribute to the raga&#8217;s overall environment and also the fact that taste for tradition has to be cultivated.The Kharaharapriya vinyasa was outstanding &#8211; the fabric woven with madhyamakala gamaka-laden phrasing, laced with spurita punctuations and an overall feeling of visranti. Dotted with enchanting passages the presentation reminded the rasikas of what values to look for in veena subtleties.Blending sampradaya with restrained creativity is both exactness of professionalism and adherence to music&#8217;s loftiness. That was precisely the Kharaharapriya edifice. The kirtana &#8220;Chakkani-Raja&#8221; was as precious as the raga alapana. The song was exposed in all is lyrical majesty.&#8220;Koniyadina&#8221; in Khambodi, studded with the sangatis and &#8220;Sakala-Graha&#8221; in Atana were played to spotlight their structural strength.Chidambaram Balashankar (mridangam) and Madipakkam Gopalakrishnan (ganjira) showed their awareness to what percussive support a veena concert required.
