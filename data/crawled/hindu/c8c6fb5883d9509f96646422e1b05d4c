VUppalapati Ankaiah Memorial concert, organised by Sangeetha Ksheerasagaram, last week at Thygarayaragana Sabha was marked by a pleasing vocal recital by Srividya Janakiraman. This concert proved a bit of a family affair in the sense that her husband \u000aJanakiraman was on violin and her brother G. Ramchandran was on mridangam, as accompanists.  Her concert was charming. She began withChalamelain Durbar in Adi talam and went forLambodarayain Varali. She gave a br\u000aief sketch of the raga and presented swaram in the kriti part, giving a measure of her manodharmam.Srilakshmi Varahamin Abhogi, Adi talam was prefaced with its brief raga and decorated with swarakalpana later.Kadalevadu Kade Ramudua rare piece in Narayana Gowla was another attractive composition that she rendered with feeling. She had then given a taste of Dharmavati raga for the popularBhajanasesyaraadain Roopaka talam.She gave considerable importance to the raga to display her technical abilities too in her neraval and swarakalpana. After another kriti rendition in Ahiri ragam, she chose to present Kambhoji as her main effort. She essayed the raga, building it into higher octaves with sense of beauty and balance.Evarimatain Adi talam was her choice number in this. It was quite an appealing rendition indeed and the beauty of it was further accentuated with the way she presented a nereval maint\u000aaining the sahitya feel. Then she framed a well structured swaraprasthara.Roga Haranain Bhageswari of Jagannadha DasuSriramabhakta Hanumana bhajan in Tamil were the light classical numbers.Violinist Janakiraman has to improve his knowledge of play as an accompanist, to match the vocalist&#8217;s vigour. The tani by the mridangam player was satisfactory.
