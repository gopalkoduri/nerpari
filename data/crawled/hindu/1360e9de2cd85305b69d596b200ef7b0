VKala Subba Rao Auditorium at Chikkadpally played host to a music competition of children rendering Ramadasa Kirtanas on February 11 in the afternoon.  The response was lukewarm, as only 25 participants enrolled for the competition organised by M. S. Kumaraswamy and Ragasudha, Domalguda. The judges for the competition were musician Jaysree Sarathy and AIR and TV composer Usha Kant. Soon after the competitions the judges presented the trophies to the winners: M. Poojitha, who secured the first prize, Lakshmi Sanjana bagged the second prize, while the third prize was bagged by Madhumitha. Eight-year-old Santoshi was given the consolation prize for being the youngest competitor.In the section for seniors  prize was awarded to Tanmayi Ramakanth.In the evening, a light music programme was organised and devotional songs composed by  C. Indiramani were sung by Ramanakumari and C. V. Suresh.As the day coincided with the Vardhanti of Ghantasala, they also sang few compositions and songs of the singer.Both the singers did fair justice to the compositions; however they need to work on theirsrutiandtaal, as at times they seemed to sway away fromsurandtaal. Overall it was a pleasant evening with soulful tunes and compositions.Bottom Template Starts
