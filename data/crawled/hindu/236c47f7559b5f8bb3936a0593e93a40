VFestivity was in the air as various organisations across the Capital arranged elaborate celebrations of the Ram Navami festival. These were mostly in the form of Sita Kalyana Mahotsava (marriage of Sita) in the bhajan tradition, but there were full-fledged Carnatic music concerts too.The Music Appreciation Centre and the Asthika Samaj, Keshavapuram, organised a special programme titled &#8216;Nee Samaanamevaru'. It was a spirited lecture-demonstration by Delhi's senior musician Akhila Krishnan on Lord Ram as visualised by Tyagaraja. The compositions of Tyagaraja that she presented, with explanations, included &#8220;Rama Nee Samaanamevaru&#8221; in raga Kharaharapriya, &#8220;Sree Rama padama&#8221; in Amritavahini, &#8220;Sogasu juda tharama&#8221; in Kannada Gowla, &#8220;Ninnuvina sukhamugana&#8221; in raga Todi and the popular &#8220;Samaja varagamana&#8221; in Hindolam. By inserting brief raga alapanas, viruthams, neraval of suitable phrases and even swarasprastaras, she made the session lively and enjoyable. The veteran was ably assisted by her students R. Saravanan, Sruthi, violinist K.V.S. Vinay, and Kumbakonam N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam.YoungstersMayur Vihar South Indian Association included two full-fledged concerts by youngsters in their celebrations. Both artistes put up impressive shows, despite the poor acoustics of the hall at the temple complex of Sri Subha Siddhi Vinayaka mandir. Beginning his concert with the Adi tala varnam in raga Darbar, Delhi V. Muthukumar (currently under the tutelage of Madurai T.N. Seshagopalan) took up two compositions of Tyagaraja, namely &#8220;Gnanamu sagaradha&#8221; in raga Poorvikalyani and &#8220;Pakkala nilabadi&#8221; in Kharaharapriya for detailed presentation. Apart from presenting fine delineations of the ragas, Muthukumar's creative talents came to the fore when he presented a neraval of a phrase from the former composition and swaraprastaras for both the songs. While Raghul managed to provide excellent support on the violin, the percussion support of Jayan P. Das on his mridangam seemed to be restrained by the poor sound effect in the hall.&#8220;Rama Rama guna seema&#8221;, a composition of Swati Tirunal in raga Simhendhra Madhyamam was the central item presented by Rajeshwari Shankar (disciple of Guru Vasanthy Krishna Rao), during another concert arranged by the same organisation. Rajeshwari handled this item very impressively, bringing out its emotive aspects. The raga alapana, neraval of the phrase &#8220;Dinabandho mamava dashamukha vidalana&#8221; and the subsequent swaraprastaras were indicative of her creative talents. However, Rajeshwari should desist from consulting her notebooks, which she did quite frequently during her concert. If one is absolutely thorough with the lyrics, one can concentrate on bringing out the bhava of the raga and the lyrics. R. Saravanan on the violin and K. Sreeram on the mridangam provided good support in this concert.DiscourseThe Delhi Tamil Sangam too organised a musical discourse by Vishaka Hari on two days. On the second day, under the title &#8220;Shabari Moksham&#8221;, Vishaka narrated the story of how Shabari rose from tribal life to attain moksha, through her Guru bhakti, and how Lord Rama himself was beside her when she attained moksha. Vishaka interwove shlokas in the form of short viruttams and a few compositions including those of Tyagaraja, Muttuswami Dikshitar, Purandaradasa, apart from Meera bhajans. Vijayaraghavan on the violin and Kumbakonam N. Padmanabhan on the mridangam provided good support in this musical discourse.
