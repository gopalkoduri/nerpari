VThe organisers  took adequate care to encourage up and coming artistes.  A brilliant performance on the keyboard by V.G. Vigneshwar, a disciple of  T. V. Gopalakrishnan,  kept the audience spell-bound.What surprised the music-lovers was the rendering of rare kirtanas by Anuradha Krishnamurthy.The kirtana glorifying  Brahadambal, the presiding deity of a popular Saivite temple in Pudukottai, composed by Trivandrum Maharaja in Husseni  raga,  set to Adi talam, provided an  opportunity for the audience to listen to a rare kirtana.The  jugalbandi session, highlighting the amalgamation of Carnatic and Hindustani patterns in music by Sriram Parasuram and Anuradha Sriram, exposed how Tyagaraja  preferred several Hindustani and Carnatic ragas to glorify Lord Rama in a unique style. The highlight of their performance was the kirtana &#8216;Marukaelera&#8217; in Jayantasri.Commencing with a Thodi varnam, they rendered several kirtanas and songs in support of the jugalbandi style, the most marvellous being the one in Subhapanthuvarali,  besides the Subramania Bharatiar song in Suvanesa Ranjini, the Meera bhajan composed by Madhu Ghouse. Kamalambal Navavarna kirtana in Sahana  also enlightened the audience. They were accompanied by Salem Srinivasan on the miridangam, Bombay Chandrajith on the tabla and Pudukottai Ambiga Prasad on the violin.A special session on harikatha by T. N. Seshagopalan surprised the audience. Quoting several verses from the Kamba Ramayanam, Arunachala Kavirayar and Azhwars, he profusely explained how devotion to Lord Rama would liberate the souls.
