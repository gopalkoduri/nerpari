VG. SWAMINATHANSreevalson J. Menon's voice carries resonant masculinity and good volume. He has  honed it well to exploit the assets to the hilt.  Therefore, when he scaled the high notes of Reetigowla, negotiated the passages in middle level and touched the lower octave quite effortlessly, the overall effect was significantly enjoyable. Reetigowla with its inbuilt melody and charm had taken an extremely fascinating form in Sreevalson's expression in the alapana for Tyagaraja's `Cheraravathemira.'Menon's full throated articulation of Saveri and later Simhendramadyamam also glowed because of his preference for slow unwinding of the raga with intense holdouts followed by free rolling akaras. With his vocal chords in  full favour and control, Menon's treatises of all the three ragas were a  treat.Noticeably impressive`Muruga Muruga,' Periaswami Thooran's sombre composition in Saveri, was presented in a simple way without many frills. Mysore Vasudevachar's `Rama Rama Guna Seema' was fitted into the main slot with neraval and swaras at `Munimanasa Dhama.' Here, probably, the time factor triggered the singer to hastily wind up with conspicuous stridency in raga and swaras. However, Sreevalson's kalpanaswaras were basically controlled. After the  initial warm up, Sreevalson anchored his combinations on a specific note with care. He wrapped up with a few more rounds of manageable lengths of swaras avoiding redundancy.`Tulasidala' in Mayamalavagowla of Tyagaraja and `Akilandeswari' in Dwijavanthi by Dikshitar were impressive.V.V.Ravi was on the violin giving Menon  perfect responses in raga alapana and kalpanswaras. His contribution in enhancing the quality of Reetigowla, was also significant  in Saveri and Simhendramadyamam. Madirimangalam Swaminathan was the sole but seasoned percussion support on the mridangam. The concert was to mark the anniversary celebrations of Rukmini Arts & Music Trust held at Raga Sudha hall.Bottom Template Starts
