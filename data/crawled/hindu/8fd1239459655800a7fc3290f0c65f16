V&#8220;The concept of ragas, and the numerous methodical classifications that are available for its identification are what makes the Indian Carnatic genre a literal boon to World Music for better understanding,&#8221; said Mala Mohan, musician with a double-masters in music, at the Indiranagar Sangeetha Sabha in her lec-dem on the classification of Ragas. Mala, a student of Neela Ramgopal and an A-grade artist of AIR, Chennai, said as raga is a pivotal concept of Indian music forms, tracing its structural identity and make-up is paramount for determining its inbuilt characteristics. And for this it is only the age-old classifications that prove to be a constructive guide for practical reference.Mala went on to explain the classification of the scales from the 72 janaka ragas (parent or generic) that take shape from the permutations and combinations of the 12 swara sthanas; and the infinite janya (derivative) scales further channelled into upanga, bhashanga, audava, vakra, varja, nishadantya, dhaivatantya, panchamantya and madhyamantya ragas. Only a few amongst these such as Saveri, Sahana, Dhanyasi, Anandabhairavi, Begada, Mukhari, Bhairavi, Kambhoji, Shankarabharana etc., with appreciable melodic qualities, often showing up its character through signature phrases and gamakas. These aretermed &#8216;rakthi' to connote their magnificence and structure, she explained.The history of the raga classification started 2,000 years ago during the period of Bharata and the Matanga. Interesting observations as the Raga-Ragini classification by Damodhara in &#8220;Sangita Darpana&#8221; has ragas coming under Stree, Purusha and Napunsaka, while the 17 {+t} {+h} Century categorisation had them under ghana, naya and desya which brought in their sturdy, softer and borrowed features for its labelling.Mala went on to detail the modern classifications of Prof. Sambamurthy for the janya ragas that had them in scale-based, rakthi, bashanga (the foreign note that adds a flavour) and the vakra (with zig-zag patterns).Mala Mohan's demonstration with the session chaired by Dr. T.S. Sathyavathi made it more exciting as the two came up with their observations and perceptions on the crucial madhyama usages in Begada and the exploits of the two dhaivatas in Bhairavi, giving an idea of how they are used by different schools.
