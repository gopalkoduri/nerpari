VChewing betel leaves and listening to the legendary GNB on his walkman, the Carnatic musician Neyveli Santhanagopalan is down to earth.  Completely at home in a modest hotel, the scholarly musician  dressed in a crisp kurta, and a traditional tilak adorning his forehead, was in Bangalore for the Gayana Samaja&#8217;s annual music conference. &#8220;This place has a rich history: it has been home to great names of music and literature. What more, the  food is excellent. How about trying some puri-palya?&#8221; the affable musician offered generously. Neyveli Santanagopalan is at ease even when he travels out of country.  The seasoned vocalist preserves all the values with which he grew up in Neyveli in Tamil Nadu and yet brings in a contemporary thought and update to his music to be able to reach every true rasika around the globe.The 45-year-old just cannot stop talking of his guru T.N. Seshagopalan who has been his anchor  right from his student days.  &#8220; I heard him in Neyveli as a 10th standard student,  after which I just wanted to pack my bags and leave with him for being in his gurukulavasa,&#8221; recollects Santhanagopalan. &#8220;Seshagopalan asked me to take it easy until I completed my graduation. But as my gradation in physics came to a close, I was sitting in the train to Madurai with full of hope that my guru would accept me. Here I am grateful to him for bringing me to this stage,&#8221; he says with gratitude.Santhanagopalan, born in Tiruchi, came to Neyveli when he was five with his father taking up a job at Neyveli Lignite Corporation. &#8220;Our colony was nestled in fruit and vegetable orchards with an abundance of green that resembled an English countryside. Not just that, there were 30-graded musicians of AIR who have now settled in various parts of the globe.&#8221;Santhanagopalan cherishes his cycle-rides to school along with his father. &#8220;Every ride had a new raga, and my father&#8217;s Kalyani inspired by Madurai Mani Iyer was a treat. We passed through the green fields as morning sun and the music filled us with energy,&#8221; he recollects. &#8220;My father wanted me to be associated with serious music, although my mother, albeit a music lover, would have been happy to see me as a doctor or engineer,&#8221; he laughs.Guru Seshagopalan didn&#8217;t just start with music lessons for the young graduate who was fairly well-trained by local teachers in Neyveli. &#8220;His vision was farther, he made me teach music part-time to junior students in a college for helping me have pocket money,&#8221; says Santhanagopalan.The vocalist&#8217;s learning phase had a four-year  sing-and-observe period that made him grasp the subtle nuances of the fine art that proved an asset for his lifetime. &#8220;My guru&#8217;s Todi, at least 250 versions that I have heard, had novelties in each phrase. Every rendition was a different experience and the contours that he sketched were profound manodharma exercises. Afternoon siestas are something he would hate, and every noon would be a pallavi-rehearse time.&#8221;Although Santhanagopalan treads his guru&#8217;s path and has an unmistakable  Seshagopalan stamp in his renditions, a passion to emerge distinctive made him incorporate some rich aspects of Ariyakudi, Semmangudi, Madurai Mani and GNB that added a newer perspective to his style. Trained in the veena too, he is now all set to present a veena-duet with vocalist S. Soumya in the ensuing music season in Chennai.&#8216;Hear-more-learn-more&#8217; is what Santhanagopalan&#8217;s Net Learning aims at.  &#8216;NSG Net learning&#8217; was born with the idea of disseminating traditional music lessons. It has a professional facilitator stationed at San Francisco to take care of the logistics of distributing audio-material that is sent through the net to every student in the U.S., Australia, London, Singapore, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi etc.Potential performers are selected by Santhanagopalan himself after listening to their recorded pieces, while audio lessons and discussions are on Skype Conferencing too.Visit NSGnetlearning.blogspot.com /guruneyveli@gmail.com
