As an elegy to his rich contribution to Telugu literature, a CD of his songs was released recently at the Central University of Hyderabad. Credit goes to veteran music composer, 90-year-old Palgummi Viswanatham, for working on these songs and for composing and recording them.In fact, it was he who first encouraged Seshendra Sarma to pen songs for radio that were broadcast over AIR, Hyderabad, where Palagummi was music producer at that time. The CD was sponsored by Raja Kumari Indira Devi. The songPremaa..
