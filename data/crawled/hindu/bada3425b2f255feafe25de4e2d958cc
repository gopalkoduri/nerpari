VIf a good rendering of songs provides quiet pleasurable experience, the concert of Padma Sandilyan for the Krishna Gana Sabha conveyed it in a good measure. Similarly, without frills and fancies, raga alapanas too were in the same mood.Without nothing of today's commercial slickness of presentation, Padma Sandilyan's programme reflected her modesty within the limitations of her equipment.Pride of placeOf the ragas she chose to elaborate, Sankarabharanam was given the pride of place and she did justice to it. But the response of the young violinist, Charumathy Raghuram, was delicious. Her vision of the raga's sensitivity was imprinted on every sanchara. The other raga vinyasa by Padma Sandilyan was Vachaspati (Paraatpara) in which too Charumathy's class was evident. Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar, on the mridangam, along with the ghatam artiste Nanganallur Swaminathan, made his laya support Leka-based. That was his lively contribution.SVKBottom Template Starts
