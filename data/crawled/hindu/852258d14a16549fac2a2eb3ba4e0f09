VWhile the sudden drop in the city&#8217;s temperature and intermittent showers gave a reprieve to the parched city, it was a nostalgic journey by B.R.Kumar, former Deputy Director, AIR and DD and Radha Bhaskar, Editor,Samudhra,when they recalled their association with &#8216;Sulochana mami&#8217; through interesting anecdotes. The heavy downpour was probably a heavenly blessing from the Guru to her senior most disciple, Prema Rangarajan, who gave an impressive performance of highest classical standards.It was a sedate start with &#8216;Vinayaka Vighna Nashaka&#8217; (Vegavauhini-Rupakam-Dikshitar). The swaras were crisp and brilliant. Patnam Subramania Iyer&#8217;s &#8216;Evarunnaru Nannu Brochutaku&#8217; (Adi) in Simhavahini revealed the strict patanthara. Prema excelled in bringing out the beauty of Valaji without merely resorting to permutation of swara phrases and for Padma Sankar hailing from the Lalgudi school it was child&#8217;s play. Her reply was equally spirited.Prema then took up, N.S.Ramachandran&#8217;s &#8216;Maha Tripurasundari,&#8217; a kriti always close to the heart of her guru. The powerful lyrics &#8216;Characharamayee Chinmayee Chidambara Sareerini&#8217; was taken up for niraval sans any butchering. One could not but help going into a prayerful mood visualising  Sarva Sakthi.  The kalpanaswaras that followed thankfully did not disturb the spirit of the earlier phase.Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Manamu Leda&#8217; (Hamirkalyani-Adi) was preceded by a neat sketch of the raga. Padma complemented it with aplomb. Then came the toast of the evening &#8216;Thodi.&#8217; Prema was at ease traversing through the raga sandwiching it with both briga-oriented phrases and long karvais.The  perceptible nagaswara influence  added value to the essay.The tanam was even more lilting, laced with spuritam-oriented phrases normally identified with the veena. The pallavi &#8216;Ganesa Janani Kumara Janani Loka Janani&#8217; (Misra Jampai), again in praise of Sakthi, with anagata eduppu was an adroit presentation which would have done her guru, the composer, proud.The anticipation of the percussionists &#8212; Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar and N. Guruprasad &#8212; was praiseworthy. Their thani enlivened the proceedings.  The Karnaranjani tillana, composed by SP, brimmed  with the raga&#8217;s pristine beauty. It was also heartening to note that the balancing of sound was its best.
