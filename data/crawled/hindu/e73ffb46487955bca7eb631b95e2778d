VDwaram's tradition of violin playing is quite distinct in tonal purity, bowing technique and sound production.&#160;The richness of the style came to fore in the violin concert given by Ch.Sanyasi Rao of Vizianagaram, a retired violin lecturer of M.R.Government&#160;&#160;Music College.&#160;Visually impaired Sanyasi Rao gave his concert on the first day of the 23 {+r} {+d} Anniversary celebrations of `Swarajhari' Sangeeta Sabha of Vijayawada at Sringeri Maha Peetha Paripalitha Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram, Vijayawada.&#160;&#160;Sanyasi Rao's nephews M. Neeladri and Ch.Pavankumar played supporting violins.&#160;&#160;Starting with Natakuranji varnam Sanyasirao played Pranamamyaham in Gowla and Akhilandeswari in Dwijavanthi in proper kalapramanam.&#160;&#160;After playing Janani in Reetigowla, took up a Pallavi in Subhapantuvarali set to trisra triputa talam.&#160;&#160;The lyric of the pallavi Tatta Dhimitha Taiyani-Sada Sivudadene was neatly executed in three speeds without a flaw and the kalpana was finisted as an exquisite ragamalika.&#160;&#160;Sanyasi Rao was ably supported by his nephews M. Neeladri and Ch. Pavankumar.&#160;&#160;M.Edukondalu and M.Haribabu gave good rhythmic support on mridangam and ghatam respectively.&#160;&#160;Fourteen-year-old14 year old G.M.T.Nageswara Sarma showed fine talent in the first concert on the second day.&#160;&#160;His grasp of the raga bhava while playing the keertana Siva Kameswari in Kalyani was commendable.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main concert of the day was a superb vocal by Kumari Bhavaraju Lakshmi Soorya Teja of Visakhapatnam.&#160;&#160;A disciple of noted singer Pantula Rama, Soorya Teja, singing for the first time in Vijayawada stole the hearts of the rasikas with her melodious&#160;&#160;voice and neat style.&#160;&#160;She showed high standard of manodharmam aspects. Flawless to the end she rendered as the major items, Annapoorne in Sama, Padmavathiramanam in Poorvikalyani and a Pallavi in Madhyamavathi Nanu Brovara Sri Venkatesa &#8211; Sri Rama Lola' set to Khanda Jathi triputa talam.Madhyamavathi delineation was imaginative and exhaustive.&#160;&#160;The kalpana swaras were crisp and clear and showed rhythmic precision.&#160;Towards the close Soorya Teja sang a Kabir Bhajan, and a&#160;Satya Sayi Sai Bhajan. She had good support on violin by M. Neeladri and on the mridangam by M. Edukondalu.&#160;&#160;The final day of the festival featured first, a veena ensemble presented the students of the Music College and students of veena vidwan K.S.Govindarajan, veena lecturer in the College.&#160;&#160;Participants in the enjoyable program were Vasantalakshmi,&#160;&#160;M.L.Madhuri, Suneeta, Vijayalakshmi, M.Rama, Hemalata, R.Sradha Vasanti Venkat and A.Kanakadurga.&#160;&#160;The group played with good coordination, keertanas in Sudha Bangala, Mukhari, Hamsanadam, Pharaz and Hamsanandi.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The three day fete came to a fitting finish with a pleasing vocal concert by Deevi Ravikant, a disciple of vidwan Malladi Suribabu.&#160;&#160;Sporting a deep and vibrant voice, Ravikant exhibited fine maturity and scholarship.&#160;&#160;His Kedaragowla varnam was followed by Vinayaka in Chakravakam.&#160;&#160;In the kriti Kalavathi in the melakartha raga Yagapriya, Ravikant showed sharp sense in handling the vivadi combinations&#160;&#160;to good effect.&#160;&#160;The name of Yagapriya in Venkatamakhi tradition was Kalavathi.&#160;Another attractive item in the concert was Matimatikini in Mohana which was treated with hauntingly melodious raga version.&#160;&#160;This was a seldom heard keertana.&#160;&#160;Ravikant's alround efficiency came to fore amply in the Pallavi rendered thoroughly and with admirable command in the raga Shanmukhapriya.&#160;&#160;Ravikant was ably supported on violin by Neeladri and on the mridangam by Edukondalu.
