VThe Camerata&#8217;s purpose is  to introduce   Western classical choral music to audiences here. Much of this music  has been  written in the past 100 years and  may be unfamiliar to local audiences.At the recent concert,  Camerata was joined by several guest artists from Sweden. One of the regular members of the Camerata, Jonas Olsson, while a resident of Bangalore, is from Sweden.  Olsson invited his musical compatriots  to India to  perform with  Camerata.For this concert, Neecia Majolly chose a programme of music of which most has not been heard in this city. The major work of the evening was the &#8216;Requiem of Maurice Durufl&#233;,&#8217; written in 1947. &#8220;Requiem&#8221; (the word means &#8220;rest&#8221; or &#8220;repose&#8221;) is a common name for the traditional service of burial in the Roman Catholic church, and has a long history of elaborate musical settings.While this one was from the mid 20th century, all of its melodic material is the simple Gregorian chant stipulated for that service&#8217;s texts. But the 9th century chant in this requiem is enfolded and enveloped with harmonies from the French romantic tradition. The result is an exceedingly calm and peaceful and at the same time lush meditation on the texts.Originally for choir and orchestra, Saturday&#8217;s version was for chorus and organ, with the very difficult organ part being beautifully played by Annika Nilsson, one of the evening&#8217;s Swedish guest artists.St Andrew&#8217;s Kirk organ has recently undergone an extensive restoration. Because of noise from the fans in the room, some of the organ&#8217;s most delicate sounds were too soft to be clearly audible to the audience. But for the most part, it was a thrill to hear the organ&#8217;s colours so expertly used by  Nilsson to demonstrate the instrument&#8217;s flexibility as well as the orchestral nature of the accompaniment.Durufl&#233;&#8217;s Requiem calls for two soloists, and as it happened, one of those had a cold,  so we heard the mezzo soprano Maria Fosstrom, a singer of great artistry and flexibility, whose rich and resonant voice showed us a musical texture not usually associated with this piece but which gave all the solo passages an unexpected and enlightening layer of meaning.This quintessentially French requiem filled the first half of the programme.The second half was made up of a succession of pieces in the English cathedral tradition, interspersed with two pieces for organ by Swedish composers, played by  Nilsson.Of the English choral works, the &#8216;Magnificat&#8217; by Herbert Howells was the piece which most strongly complemented Durufl&#233;&#8217;s Requiem.Howells was a contemporary of Durufl&#233;, and his relationship to the music which immediately preceded him in the English tradition is very like that of Durufl&#233; to his immediate predecessors in France.If Durufl&#233; used a chant background to his work, Howells used the English folk-song tradition as the well from which he drew inspiration.Both, then, took simple and ancient musical traditions, and wrapped them in fresh and beautiful harmony from their own time.If the Camerata ever decides to do the Durufl&#233; Requiem again, they may well want to think about complementing it exclusively with music by Howells.The choir was certainly up to the level of accomplishment required of the repertoire chosen for this programme. Perhaps due to the acoustical problems of hearing the organ accompaniment, some passages proved difficult for the choir to tune, but their rhythmic precision and obvious enjoyment in singing carried the day.We look forward to the next visit from  Majolly and this group, dedicated to showing us facets new to audiences here of Western music. May they continue their exploration.
