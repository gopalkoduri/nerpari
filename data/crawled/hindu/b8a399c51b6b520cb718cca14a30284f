VThe performance of R. K. Srikantan at the Mani Krishnaswamy memorial function focussed on the strong foundation of his traditional training.Even at his age, voice control was the striking feature. Though the concert was just for an hour and half, the impression he created was of a full-fledged recital.The music was therefore distinctive and alive. He saw to it that the values of classical music were not sidelined.Srikantan, in his alapana of Anandabhairavi, provided the shifting images of the raga's beauty. Gamakas, karvais and madhyamakala sancharas were well harmonised touching the salient moorchanas. The kirtana was "O! Jagadamba" which he presented in such a way as to convey the dignity of the piece. Violinist R. K. Sriramkumar was exceptionally open to the beauties of Anandabhairavi.Animated by sensitive sentiments, the raga's deep delicacy of emotion was well brought out by him.There was uniform excellence of laya in the mridangam accompaniment by J. Vaidyanathan.The pattern of his percussive support solicited the attention of rasikas.SVKBottom Template Starts
