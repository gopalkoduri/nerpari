VThough appearing pompous, the sancharas were crafted in a deliberately chosen idiom conferring a rare breath of freshness. Their creative abilities were activated in this direction. Intuition, instinct and performing orientation went a long way in preserving their stature.The first major item was a Tiruvarutpa set to kirtana format in Panthuvarali. All their sophisticated technique was brought to bear on the lavish attention they paid to this piece. Their attempt to make it luminous in spectacular shades was well realised. The niraval line was elaborated with ornate structuring in stylised musical fervour helped by the flow of vocal felicity. The item was handled  with great fuss.The other stupendous effort was Madhyamavathi. The alapana by Gayatri was enriched with  sancharas marked by crispness and tonal shadings. It had a delicate filigree appeal. Her vocal control in the tarasthayi helped her place the fleeting passages in their proper place. There was natural ease in her skills to present pulsating pleasantness in her depiction of Madhyamavathi.As rasikas expected &#8216;Rama Katha Sudha,&#8217; the day being Ramanavami, Ranjani and Gayatri chose &#8216;Saravana Bhava,&#8217; indicative of the direction in which the wind was blowing. In between the two pampered items they introduced a manipravala kirtana, &#8216;Mathata Bekayya&#8217; by Ambujam Krishna in Devagandhari. The interpretative technique in rendering kirtanas  extracted rasika appreciation.The performance conformed to the present day trend of concerts not depending on major songs of the Trinity to give weightage. Condescendingly, Ranjani and Gayatri sang &#8216;Rama Neepai Tanaku&#8217; (Kedaram) and &#8216;Marugelara&#8217; (Jayantisri) of Tyagaraja, both completed in a jiffy.The way V.V.S.Murari, violinist, shuffled the sancharas in his solo version of Panthuvarali and Madhyamavathi was a sample of his fingering prowess. The forms of the ragas were preserved, not their spirit. More attention to rakti would have been rewarding which was within his grasp with the sound training he has gained.The mridangam vidwan Delhi Sriram was quite at ease with the performing pattern of the vocalists. The pace of the two major kirtanas  was in tune with his percussive preference. He found fulfilment in his accompanist role. K.V.Gopalakrishnan (kanjira) was in the shadow all the time.
