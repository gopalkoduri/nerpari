VSAMANTH SUBRAMANIANFor 12 years now, musicians have been descending annually on Fes, Morocco, for the Festival of World Sacred Music &#151;  an event that acknowledges, in these carefully secular times, music's immense debt to religion. Religion itself, however, plays no active part in this. If anything, it is politely asked to take a seat in the last row, from where it can tap its fingers and hum along, as musician after musician performs amidst the magnificence of the ancient town.The Fes Festival was recently transplanted into New York City's Carnegie Hall, to the Zankler auditorium that, with all its light slatted wood, provides the unique experience of watching a concert in what feels like a rattan picnic basket.Bearing the woolly, rather hippie-like title of "The Spirit of Fes: Paths to Hope," the show was the first in the Hall's yearlong series of World Views, "The Spirit of Fes," which brought together "sacred sounds from East and West" - Sufi, Middle Eastern, Andalusian Jewish, medieval church vocal, and with the participation of Aruna Sairam, Carnatic vocal.The concert did more to bring these musicians together physically &#151;  on one stage, to feed off each other's vibes &#151;  than in any sort of musical synthesis, which was perhaps just as well. When Sairam began with a stripped-down version of "Malarndhum Malaradha," the Viswanathan-Ramamurthy favourite from ``Paasamalar," with soft percussion and a Middle Eastern stringed oud, she provided a springboard for Susan Hellauer to soar into a Gregorian chant.Sairam and Hellauer were perfectly contrasted counterpoints &#151;  the one earthy and low, the other tremulous and lofty &#151;  that seamlessly explored different interpretations of a single scale.Sairam was to sing thrice more. Her abbreviated rendition of Ponnaiah Pillai 's "Saatileni," in Poorvikalyani, included a strident sketch of swaras that earned her a clamorous ovation. Later, singing Oothukadu's Kalinga Narthana Thillana, she playfully turned part of it into a conversational patter with Jamey Haddad's percussion. Finally, she began the evening's centrepiece with a snatch of the Lalitha Sahasranamam, a piece that sequentially brought in every performer on stage &#151;  Hallauer singing church gospel, Haddad and his drums, Zafer Tawil on the oud and Arabic vocals, and Gerard Edery on the guitar and Sephardic song &#151;  in a rousing climax.It may not have been the intended centrepiece, but it certainly felt like the thematic one, with multiple styles darting in and out of each other, coexisting companionably and even complementing each other. The metaphor was obvious &#151;  if the sacred music forms can, to capitalise on the pun, live in harmony, their wellsprings of varied religions should be able to as well.What really brought the picnic basket alive, however, was Daqqa Roudania of Taroudant, the Sufi troupe that performed after intermission. With just their voices, and a set of percussive instruments that looked like they had been lathed in an elementary carpentry class, Daqqa Roudania set up a series of contagious rhythms. Each one of three pieces began in a slow, introspective singsong that then built up, in inimitable Sufi style, to a raging tempo, and the audience, unable to keep its hands to itself, compellingly set the beat.Troupe members jigged and moon-walked on the polished stage, swayed in their yellow slippers and woollen robes and broad grins, and encouraged the audience into celebrating more than music and sacred song. Daqqa Roudania was celebrating life, and that's a celebration everybody understands.Bottom Template Starts
