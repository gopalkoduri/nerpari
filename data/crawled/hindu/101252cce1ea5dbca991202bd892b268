VA three-day Sree Thyagaraja Jayanthi Music Festival had alluring concerts by maestros belonging to different styles. Rituals like Unchavriti and pujas in the make-shift shrine erected at the back of the stage provided the festival an ambience of bhakti.The opening concert by Rudrapatnam Brothers, Thyagaraja and Taranath, highlighted the fact that they are champions of classicism. Those among the audience who looked for fast numbers were disappointed, as the emphasis was on melody.&#8216;Thulasidalamulache' in Mayamalavagoula and Roopakam, with which they opened their account, was proof of their serious approach to Carnatic music. The relatively long rendering of the kriti was noteworthy for the serenity it provided. &#8216;Thelisi Ramachinthanatho' in Poornachandrika was rendered in a slightly faster tempo.Before taking up a protracted delineation of Sankarabharanam, the much sought after composition &#8216;Enthuku pedhdhala' in two-kala, set to Adi, &#8216;Thapagane' in Suddha Bangala, Roopaka tala, and &#8216;Karuna elagante' in Varali, Adi tala, were presented with &#233;lan. V.V. Ravi enthralled listeners with some flamboyant moves on the violin while Kallidaikuruchi Sivakumar (mridangam) and Thrikkakkara Y.N. Santharam (ganjira) provided excellent rhythmic support.Virtuoso recitalOn the second day of the festival, veteran T.N. Seshagopalan's two-hour recital embraced all intrinsic elements of concert music. Short swara combinations that epitomised the raga lakshana were remarkable in the first number &#8216;Sree Raghukula' in Hamsadwani. An easy glide to the lower sthayi added an additional colour to &#8216;Mariyathagadayya,' the only composition in Bhairavam. The musician's ability to soar to the upper sthayi during the swaraprasthara, that too with relative ease, was demonstrated in the alapana of &#8216;Entha bhagyamu' in Saranga.M. Chandrasekharan's violin rose to the occasion by faithfully reproducing these sancharas. In the Charukesi number &#8216;Adamodi galada' in Adi one could discern innumerable sangatis unfurled in quick succession. The swara improvisations by father and son (T.N.S. Krishna) in turn elicited applause from the audience during the recital of the main raga Abheri. The composition was &#8216;Nagumomu' in Adi. Thrissur C. Narendran and Alappuzha Gopinatha Prabhu attached a tani to this.Next, saxophonist Kadri Gopalnath took the stage with his orchestral team that consisted of Kanyakumari (violin), Patri Satishkumar (mridangam), Rajendra Nakod (tabla), Tripunithura Radhakrishnan (ghatam) and Bangalore Rajasekhar (morsing). Kadri's &#8216;Kamalaptakula' in Brindavani made fans of percussion happy. The next numbers like &#8216;Marakodi Ramani' in Vagadeswariand &#8216;Nadaloludai' in Kalyanavasantham proved that percussion was his forte. He took up Mohanam as the main raga but did not elaborate on it and went straight to the composition &#8216;Mohana Ramani' in Adi. One felt that the high-decibel output of the team was suitable for an open-air stage.A full-throated recital by Sankaran Namboothiri was full of verve and vivacity. While he took care to essay each raga of the concert in the right proportion, niravals were attempted in the main raga Bhairavi, the composition being &#8216;Thanayuni brova' in two-kala, Adi tala. Among the light numbers that followed, one felt the one in Kurinji, &#8216;Seethakalyana' in Khanta chapu, could have been in a lower tempo.Throughout, Edappilly Ajithkumar followed the musician skilfully. Balakrishna Kamath (mridangam) and Manjoor Unnikrishnan (ghatom) provided creative support.Violin duetThe finale of the festival was a violin duet by Ganesh and Kumaresh. Technical virtuosity apart, novelty in embellishments such as playing second notes for harmonising the alapana, symbiotic movements, and mastery of the instrument were the highlights of the performance.The essaying of the main raga Kharaharapriya was enchanting for the singular phrases the duo played. The composition was &#8216;Rama Nee Eda' in Adi, two-kala. Playing of the &#8216;pakkam' by Patri Satishkumar (mridangam) proved that he is well versed with all the compositions and their structure. When it came to tani, his approach was especially laudable for the &#8216;kanakku.'This edition of the annual festival was organised by Nada Laya Pravah Academy of Music, Thrissur.
