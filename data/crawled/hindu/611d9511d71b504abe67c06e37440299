VThe highlight of Dasara-2005 cultural programmes was its punctuality. However, if there was any delay it was because of the rains. Both the inaugural and the valedictory performances were thrown out of gear owing to the rains. Rangotsava-2005 at Bhoomi Geeta Kalamandira complex, received a good response.Efforts at renewing memories of the good-old Palace Concerts was partially successful. Renowned vainika R. Visveswaran's recital began with the composition of Saint Purandara in raga Kamavardhini ("Adadella Olliteayithu"). The traditional style and artistry of the artiste have remained unaffected despite several popular and modern allures.Refined pratyahata gamaka and svara prayogas with calculated single stroke resonation of sublime melody and agility were the praiseworthy domain of the artiste. Tristayi sancahari of sankeerna gamaka in chatusra roopaka and symmetrical aroha and avaroha, embellished the Purandaradasa composition in Thodi raga "Enu Dhanyalo Lakumi". Accomplished accompanists P.G. Lakshminarayana (mridanga) G.S. Ramanujam (ghata) Ramesh (mrichangi) extended adequate support for the success of the concert.The earlier concert of Chitraveena (modified shape of the Gotuvadyam to facilitate easy portability) by Vidwan Ravikiran accompanied with an ensemble of violin, flute, mridanga and ghata delighted the listeners at the venue. Well known for his mastery of the chitraveena, the artiste began with the auspicious Nata ("Mahaganapathim" of Muthuswamy Dixitar) followed by raga Kalyani ("Dayamado Ranga" of Purandaradasaru) and "Jalandara Supeetaste" of Dikshitar in raga Valaji.While the former two ragas were graceful, Valaji was more expressive with a pleasing neraval. Ravikiran took raga Hindola with an unusual chatusruthi dhaivatha.The jugalbandi with flute supplemented the splendour of the performance. The impeccable shruthi and laya with rhythmical percussion ensemble elevated the classicism of the performance.B.S.S. RAOBottom Template Starts
