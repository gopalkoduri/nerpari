VSankirtanam, a new CD in the market&#160;by Charulatha Mani is a bunch of well-known songs falling under the Carnatic classical genre.Sub-titled, &#8216;Popular Telugu kritis'&#160;the disc comprises works of Annamacharya and Ramadas which strictly speaking are not &#8216;kritis' as such.&#160;&#160;Interspersed with Thyagaraja kritis like Sri Rama paadama in Amritavaahini and Marugelara&#8230; in Jayantasri,&#160;it is a melodic vocal rendition easy on the ear with none of the embellishments and techniques employed in Carnatic classical music bogging down the listener.&#160;Different treatmenLight singing makes all the songs more accessible to&#160;the layman like any film numbers with classical raga base.&#160;&#160; Sriman Narayana,&#160;&#160; Brahma kadigina padamu,&#160;&#160; Bhavayami Gopalam,&#160; Brahmam okkate,&#160;&#160; Uyyalaluguma (Sai Yachendra composition), Rama Daya judave (Ramadas) are more appealing than the heavy Thyagaraja rendered with the same breath and easy flow.&#160;&#160;It required a different treatment to be appreciated in its true sense.&#160;&#160;The jacket of the CD has a few bloopers like Brahmam okkate being attributed to Thyagaraja!&#160;&#160;&#160;The CD is worth a place in your library if you are just one of those semi-classical music buffs. Produced and marketed by Rhythem Music (www.rhythemmusic.net) it is priced at a reasonable Rs. 150.
