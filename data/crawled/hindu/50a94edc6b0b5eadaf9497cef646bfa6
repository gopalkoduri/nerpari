VListening to Madurai R. Sundar&#8217;s recital &#8212; with Nagai Sriram, Tiruchi Sankaran, and B. Shree Sundar Kumar (ganjira) for accompanists &#8212; at Musiri Subrahmanya Iyer&#8217;s house, was to realise indubitably that the best kind of Carnatic music is for up-close listening.The ambience of Musiri&#8217;s memories added to this quality of engagement, which determined the standard of performance that day &#8211; unhurried, focused on sharing, not showing off.Sundar&#8217;s strengths are unswerving commitment to a non-textbook, mind-freshening sampradaya, and his obvious relish of fine compositions. Another is the unhurried approach to ragabhava.The drawback is a voice which is unable to replicate what the mind conceives. There was weight (gatram) in the music, and continuity, but it had to come from his imagination rather than what was actually executed by the voice, particularly in manodharama sangitam.Beginning with a sloka prefix (Gnananandamayam) to the Kanada varnam and &#8216;Vatapi Ganapatim,&#8217; Sundar plunged into a Kalyani that refused to drift even fractionally into Hindustani or modern driveways, but remained happily true to the classicist highway.A sensitive violin not only delivered a matching alapana, but created a sense of continuity to overcome the absence of sustaining karvai, modulated phrasing, and some swarasthana (and therefore sruti) inaccuracies  in the voice.A slower madhyama kala anchored &#8216;Ninnu Vina,&#8217; where the niraval wound around rakti prayogas. The swaras were so mood-tuned that the vilamba kala slid to durita kala without drawing attention to itself.By this time the voice became more malleable as it moved through poignant kritis such as Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Chittam Irangadadenayya&#8217; (Sahana) and Ambujam Krishna&#8217;s &#8216;Mariyemi Kavalanu&#8217; in Kannada.The violin was less supportive in the kriti essays but came into its own again with manodharma sangitam, when Bhairavi unfolded itself, grand enough to sustain the effulgent swarajati &#8216;Amba Kamakshi,&#8217; which was also treated with reverence. Undertaking swaraprastara for such a masterpiece demanded the kind of commitment shown by Sundar that day. He balanced the familiar with the unpredictable, where tags with pace and gati changes added to the excitement, and created a Bhairavi resonance even in sa-pa-sa positioned as a key phrase in the finale.How lucky we are to have artistes like Tiruchi Sankaran to remind us of an aesthetics of elegance and majesty. He bound every mind with a mesmerising, melody-riveted resonance from first to last.Shree Sundar Kumar held his own with the veteran. Here was much virtuosity and vivaram but so natural in its flow that keeping the beat was no effort but an involuntary response.
