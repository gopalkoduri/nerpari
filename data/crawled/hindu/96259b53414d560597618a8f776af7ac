VS hri Krishna Gana Sabha in Mysore had arranged a vocal concert of Pallavi Prasanna Madhyashta; H.N. Smitha (violin) and Radhesh (mridanga) accompanied her.This young artiste sang with a melodious voice, which in the fit of the gushing extempore betrayed slight tendency to become stentorian as it reached higher octaves. She could reach taara panchama with ease; but somehow, the singer was reserve in displaying the needed profusion in the mandra sthayi.The very first number &#8220;Gam Ganapathe&#8221; (Hamsadhwani- Muthayya Bhagavathar) flashed tenable signs of undue emphases laid on swarakalpana and speeding progressions.The method of alapana in Kamavardhini (&#8220;Neranammithinayya&#8221; - Thyagaraja), running short of an analytical approach, necessitated considerations to general guidelines enunciated in classical works like &#8220;Sangeetha Sampradaya Pradarshini&#8221; (Subbarama Dikshithar). On the other hand, violinist rendered this raga more impressively and methodically.Similarly, passages in Mohana (&#8220;Ra Ra Rajivalochana&#8221; - Vasudevacharya) tread labyrinthine paths, and Smitha's approach was not much different here.To a considerable extent, the sahitya-s (observe the neraval at &#8220;Vedashastra Purana&#8221; in the above Thyagaraja's kriti) also suffered by these complex articulations, undermining the emotive aspects of the compositions. Having rendered without necessary pauses, the swarakalpana sections could not bring out the ragabhava, one expected from this singer of high potential.However, Purandaradasa's devaranama-s &#8220;Innu Daya Baarade&#8221; (Kalyanavasantha) and &#8220;Idu Bhagya Idu&#8221; stood in perfect contrast to the above ones, in matters of ideal speed, refined intonations, alluring smoothness and lilting emotive fervours.Rajyashri Josyar sang at Ganabharathi, accompanied by Aditi Krishna Prasad (violin) and Radhesh (mridanga). Overall planning of the concert made a large difference in making it acceptable : the format in which she presented them displayed taste and maturity.However, in addition to confirming the competence of the singer, the concert revealed certain areas, which lagged behind in sufficiently imparting melody to either the ragas or the compositions.The general narrative style, hurried without necessary pauses, adapted while rendering &#8220;Intamodiseya&#8221; (varna- Saranga-Thiruvottiyur Thyagayya) could not adequately highlight the beauty of composition.The higher octaves posed perceptible constraints for her imagination to unfurl freely, making the voice thin. Lower octaves also to a certain extent hindered free inflections. These factors collectively hampered a consistency in the tonal qualities. Consequently, in spite of rich imagination and expertise she could not realise her ideas to the expected heights.Singer's expatiation of Hindola (&#8220;Saamagaana Lole&#8221; - GNB) was appealing, but a few violin curves of the melody accompanist suffered with instances of imbalance. The presentation comprised a neraval at &#8220;Soma Bimba Vadane&#8221; (anupallavi). Remarkable fluency while framing the swarakalpana fell short of refined smoothness. With due care and visualisation the learned artiste could have trimmed, burnished and avoided spiky articulations.Rajyashri admirably presented raga, tana and pallavi (&#8220;Vani Kalyani Kiravani&#8221;) in Kiravani: the general warmth, appreciable involvement and inspiring verve commanded unreserved appreciations. The number also featured a few strains of swarakalpana in Revathi and scholarly tani avarthana by Radhesh.Other interesting inclusions, some with elaborations, were &#8220;Garudagamana&#8221; (Nagaswaravali-Patnam), &#8220;Maayamma Anine&#8221; (Ahiri-Shyamashastri), &#8220;Rakshisu Lokanayakane&#8221; (Varali-Purandaradasa), &#8220;Shrichakraraja Nilaye&#8221; (Shivashakti-GNB) and the like.
