VIt&#8217;s an irony that while Odissi dance has gained global recognition and has been conferred the coveted classical status, Odissi music &#8212; an integral part of the Odissi dance style &#8212; is still struggling for the recognition that it deserves. Against this depressing backdrop, Bhubaneswar-based Sangeet Sudhakar Balakrushna Dash Foundation, named after the legendary Odissi singer-composer, has been hosting an annual state-level Odissi music festival in the state capital for the past nine years. This is the only festival of its kind where one comes across various styles of Odissi singing by the veterans and the budding as well.The four-day festival this year hosted at Rabindra Mandap recently featured recitals in solo, duet and group formats by about 300 artistes. It was heartening to watch 96-year-old Kanduri Charan Rout and several septuagenarian singers of the state perform with passion and perfection. And there were a number of teenagers as well who could be safely branded as the future faces of Odissi. The festival further featured group recitals by 12 prominent institutions of Orissa which are engaged in teaching and promotion of Odissi music. Of the group presentations, the typical Jaga Akhada Sangeet by Puri&#8217;s Puratani Kala Mandir stood apart while Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya, Bhubaneswar; Nrutya Sangeet Kala Mandir, Baleswar and Odisha Sangeet Parishad of Puri had impressive presentations.Among the well-known vocalists who were crowd-pullers were the eminent composers Ramahari Das, disciple of late Balakrushna Dash, Keshab Rout, Chandramani Lenka, Lata Ghosh, Bijay Kumar Jena and Mohapatra Minati Bhanja. And much to the cheer of the older generation gurus and singers who were worried over the future of Odissi music for lack of any patronage, most of the young singers stole hearts with brilliant recitals. Promising performers like Sangeeta Panda, Dhiraj Mohapatra, Himansu Sekhar Swain, Rupak Parida, Nazia Alam, Sur Sarita Rout and Sarbeswar Baitharu proved that Odissi is in safe hands.This year&#8217;s festival was dedicated to the memory of neighbouring Chhatisgarh&#8217;s Odissi music exponent late Pyari Mohan Panda whom Orissa Government had specially honoured earlier for his life-long dedication to promotion of Odissi music in an alien cultural environment outside Orissa. And young Chhatisgarhi singer Kishore Barik, the only vocalist of the festival to sing twice on audience demand, had a word of praise for the committed efforts of the marginalised Odissi singers.
