VA recent vocal concert by celebrated musician Dr. K.J. Yesudas was part of the ongoing Sri Ramanavami music festival conducted by Sri Rama Seva Mandali, Bangalore. He was accompanied by S.R. Mahadeva Sharma (violin), Tiruvarur Bhakthavatsalam (mridanga), and Tripunithura Radhakrishnan (ghata).&#8220;Eranapai&#8221; the adi tala varna in Thodi, was followed by a brief sketch of Amrithavarshini and the krithi &#8220;Jayajaya Jayajaya Mooshaka Gamana&#8221;. A veritable downpour of kalpana swaras in two speeds ended with a stint round the tara sthayi shadja, interweaving entrancing melodic patterns with rhythmic combinations.A traditional favourite, Thyagaraja's &#8220;Janakiramana&#8221; in Shuddhaseemantini raga and adi tala, preceded a brief alapana of Sriranjini and the composition &#8220;Srinivasa&#8221; in rupaka tala, ornamented with kalpana swaras in two speeds. The consummate power and quality of the artiste's voice was manifest in &#8220;Ksheerasagara Shayana&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in Devagandhari raga and adi tala, especially in the articulation of the phrase &#8220;Taraka Nama&#8221;, charged with emotional and devotional fervour.Keeravani was next taken up for a fairly detailed alapana that once again bore testimony to the mesmerising pull of the voice, its phenomenal range and flexibility. Ascending quickly to the tara sthayi, the elaboration touched the ati thara sthayi shadja effortlessly, and descended to the mandra sthayi shadja subsequently with equal felicity. The recital, which was punctuated with several observations on music and exhortations and advice to aspiring musicians and their parents, progressed with &#8220;Hari Nimma Pada Kamala&#8221; set to adi tala.The pallavi sahithya was expanded in a neraval of moderate length and several rounds of kalpana swaras that maintained a relentless grip over laya, concluding with diminishing tala cycles landing at the tara sthayi shadja and an elaborate tani avarthana. Superb violin and percussion support, adhering faithfully to the mandate of the vocalist, contributed significantly to the impact of the concert.A vocal recital by Dr. Muralidharan accompanied by Sunil (vocal support), M.S. Govindswamy (violin), C. Cheluvaraju (mridanga) and Gurumurthy (ghata) was part of the same music festival.Among the notable inclusions in the concert, which consisted entirely of audava ragas, was a fine rendition of Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar's composition &#8220;Sri Jalandharam&#8221; in Gambhiranatta raga and adi thala. Muthaiah Bhagavathar's &#8220;Rajarajaradhithe&#8221; in Niroshttha, was followed by a compact and evocative alapana of Sunadavinodini, suffixed with Mysore Vasudevacharya's &#8220;Devadi Deva&#8221;. The transition to Hindolam thereafter appeared to pose a challenge sruthi wise, occasioned probably by the shift to another panchama varjya raga with a similar swara structure featuring notes of the lower variety. Deekshithar's &#8220;Neerajakshi&#8221; was, however, rendered well thereafter.The lilting charm of Mohanam was encapsulated in a succinct alapana, and in Thyagaraja's &#8220;Evarura&#8221; in misra chapu thala, ornamented with kalpana swaras. The succeeding elaboration of Madhyamavathi was suffused with raga bhava accentuated with melodious sancharas and fluent brighas. Shyama Shastri's &#8220;Palinchu Kamakshi&#8221; was presented with brief kalpana swaras and a thani avarthana, but a more comprehensive treatment with the inclusion of a neraval would have underscored the majestic appeal of the krithi. Wholehearted support from the accompanying artistes was a highlight of the concert.
