VCarnatic DelightsDr. Chitra Ram Carnatic classical (Rs. 90).Dr. Chitra Ramakrishnan is a professional Carnatic Musician and Bharatanatyam dancer. She has had her musical training from Chalapuram Pappa and Mathur P. Balasubramaniam.She has recorded 12 songs, more in the light classical vein, for Abhirami that begins with the invocatory Vinayaka song in Tilang, "Sri Ganesha Charanam" by Papanasam Sivan.The artiste is gifted with a pleasant, fluid voice that is one of the most crucial cogs in the vocalists wheel "Kanden Kanden" of Arunachala Kavirayar tuned in Bageshri by Lalgudi Jayaraman and Ambujam Krishna's "Enna Solli" in Kanada are ear-friendly versions, but the phrase g m g r s in the madhya sthayi in the Kanada song is not very relevant to the raga swaroopa g m r s would be more appropriate."Booloka Kumari" of Bharatiar with a brisk gait and Rajaji's "Kurai Onrum Illai" with adequate melodic substance have enough appeal to impress.Agastiyar's "Sri Chakraraja Nilaye" as a ragamalika in Chenchurutti, Punnagavarali, Nadanamakriya and Sindhubhairavi and Annamacharya's "Brammamokate" are sung sweetly. The raga of the latter composition may be referred to as Misra Bowli because of the couple of swaras alien to the melody appear now and then. Tulsidas's "Sri Rama Chandra Krupalu" in Yaman Kalyani with the singer's vocal chords in fine flow has a soothing, lulling effect.Annamacharya's "Muddugare" in Kuranji and "Maithrim Bhajatha" composed by the venerable Saint of Kanchi, and tuned so sensitively by Vasanth Desai are heart warming, mellifluously embellished renditions.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
