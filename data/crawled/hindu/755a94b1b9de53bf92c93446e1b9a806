VThe group has identified a few temples  to renovate which funds are raised  through Irai Isai Payanam. They visit the houses of devotees and music lovers. After a brief puja, they recite devotional and classical compositions.The money donated by the family and invitees goes towards the temple work. Often, neighbours and friends  join hands  to organise the concert. &#8220;Any time, any day and any amount is fine. We see each Irai Isai Payanam kutcheri as godsend and put off other works (even their regular concerts) when we get an offer. These days we perform  even at small functions such as shastiaptapurti and housewarming. The aim is to collect more money and reach out to more temples,&#8221; says violinist Balasubramaniam. &#8220;We collect almost Rs. 15,000 to 20,000 at every concert.&#8221;Till date the team has performed 41 payanam concerts. &#8220;It&#8217;s a unique experience; spiritually elevating and creatively satisfying. I never  miss playing at  these concerts,&#8221; says mridangist Mali. What the team enjoys most is the freedom these concerts allow to experiment with style and format. &#8220;Unlike stage performances, emotion matters more than technique,&#8221; adds Balashankar. &#8220;We have seen our listeners enjoying it too. It&#8217;s more like a satsang.&#8221;Senior Carnatic vocalists have expressed interest in the project. &#8220;Prof. Chandrasekhar, O.S.Thyagarajan, Vijay Siva and a few others are willing to perform at these concerts,&#8221; says Ganesh.The Payanam team began with Shri Ekambareswarar Temple in Nanmangalam, which got a fresh coat of paint and a rajagopuram. &#8220;It was not a major work. We had to raise Rs. 4 lakhs, which was not difficult,&#8221; says Ganesh. The next destination is Shri Shringeeswarar Temple in Meppedu, about 30 km from Poonamallee near Chennai. The repair work has begun and involves an expenditure of Rs. 65 lakhs. &#8220;We need a few more lakhs to complete the work,&#8221; he adds.The musicians&#8217; effort does not stop with raising money. They are personally involved in the renovation work. &#8220;We get in touch with  sthapatis to retain the authentic design and construction details and also supervise the work. Luckily, we have committed people who have volunteered to help us carry out the renovation work,&#8221; says Balasubramanian. &#8220;Another exciting aspect of Irai Isai Payanam is getting to know the mythology associated with these temples. It&#8217;s like turning the chapters of history.  For instance, legend has it that Lord Anjaneya sang raga Amritavarshini for Lord Shringeeswarar at the Meppedu temple,&#8221; says Balashankar.Not just in Tamil Nadu and a few other places in the country, Payanam has crossed borders. The team will perform for the second time in Dubai. Many NRIs want to organise these concerts in their country and donate for the cause. For the future, Ganesh feels if a group of four musicians takes up one temple, &#8220;We can definitely save the 14,000 temples in Tamil Nadu that are in bad shape.&#8221;&#8220;Besides saving the heritage, it feels nice to put back the smile on the faces of the people living around these temples,&#8221; says Ganesh.
