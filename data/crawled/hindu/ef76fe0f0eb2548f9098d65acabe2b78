VBestowed with a rich tonal quality in tristayi, classicism and involvement marked the Hindustani vocal concert of Pandit Muddumohan, a dedicated artiste from the gurukula of Pandit Basavaraja Rajguru, one of the most accomplished artistes of Hindustani repertory.His presentation was appealing and pleasing without going much into the depth of classicalism.His delineation of Multani with precision on its svara groups giving prominence to melody both in vilambit ektaal and drut was appreciable.Pandit Muddumohan took up a devotional composition after a glimpse of the raga Kaushi-Kanada with a mixture of Malkauns and Darbari Kanada in uttaranga with excellent modulations and clarity of sahitya that enthralled the audience "Idu snana-idu snana vayya" in Rishabapriya, "Idu ninage dharmave Indiresha" in raga Dhani.The concert concluded with a composition in Sindhu Bhairavi, an Akkamahadevi vachana. The inspiring rhythm by Vishwanath Nakod on tabla and refined melody of harmonium elevated the performance held at the Jaganmohan Palace during the recently concluded Parangathotsava-2006.B.S.S.
