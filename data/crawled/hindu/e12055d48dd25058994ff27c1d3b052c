VVIJAY GEORGEMusic is essentially a form of expression, where success cannot be gauged by pluses and minuses...  PRAVIN MANIHe had a rather tough task ahead  -   to do a `Jazzie,' all over again. And from the initial response evoked by the songs of `By the People,' Pravin Mani seems to have succeeded on that front. Pravin has composed the music for the sequel to `4 the People,' the highlight of which was Jazzie Gift's music.Pravin, who completed his post graduation in Engineering and Production from the School of Audio Engineering, Sydney, has his own audio production facility in Chennai. He has produced quite a number of albums and had scored the music for `Alibaba,' an animated feature film in English. He was the music director for films such as `Dancer' and `Ottran' and has been acknowledged as a singer as well, with songs like `Ku mu kee pee...' in the film `London.'Pravin says that he has relocated  to Canada, "to pursue my dreams in establishing a worldwide audience for my music."The S 5 band, formed by SS Music channel, has sung Pravin's compositions in `By the People'. In fact, Pravin's association with the band had started even before. He had composed the songs for the band's debut album, `Isai.'Says the composer on `Isai' and `By the People,' "We wanted to move away from the conventional stream. Jayaraj is one director who is ready to experiment. I had worked with him for the music of `Daivanamathil.' He gives total freedom for the composer."He feels that "the way the S 5 band sing and blend together is amazing. They have their own individual strengths and we have highlighted them."Pravin says that he belongs to the A.R. Rahman school, where the adage is "you have to sound different to be noticed." In fact Rahman was his chum even before he became a sensation."I was in Australia while `Roja' became a rage, but success has never gone into his head. I am amazed by his humility," he says .He is all praise for Jazzie Gift and `Lajjavathiye... '"Kerala is musically rich. There is something special about the sense of music that south Indians have . I have quite a number of Malayalis working in my team," says Pravin.Pravin, who has grown up in Chennai believes that "music is essentially a form of expression, where success cannot be gauged by the pluses and minuses on strict terms. But we all aspire for admiration that gives you the energy to strive for more."Bottom Template Starts
