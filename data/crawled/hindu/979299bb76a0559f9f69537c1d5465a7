VB.R.C IYENGARVaidyanathan, the son and disciple of his father Balasubramaniam, gave a blissful performance under the aegis of Kalasagaram last week. The concert was different from the normal in the sense that it was in the old style devoid of publicity acrobatics.  Basically it was disciplined art, rich in classicism, decorum and devoid of self-hypnotising repetitions, no chicanery and no adulteration.  It was however sullied by excessive body language and gesticulations.  Also the artiste is too aware of himself and has a sense of overconfidence.These features were  evident in his endeavour to overdo a feature, be italapanaorneraval; in his exertion the  imbalance was  prejudiced and the programme got  out of control. The artiste's voice unfortunately is not that attractive and  thesruticomponent was a little errant.Komanduri Seshadri, the former principal of the Music College accompanied him on the violin and Vankayala Narasimhalu on themridangam. Kapa Srinivasa Rao was on thekhanjira.Restraint and relaxationWhat impressed most were the format of the concert, the selection, the order of succession and thekalapramanamof each item. Vaidyanathan exercised lot of restraint and relaxation (visranthi), which is very essential for a successful performance. Opening up with a briskata thala varnaminKanadahe moved on toParamapurushainVasantha. The following itemLekhanainAsaveriwas a stimulating choice. The time measure was ideal and necessarily thebhavacame out with immense impact.ThealapanaofPanthuvaraliwas reasonably goodSri Ranjaniand thekrithi, Marubalkawas in keeping with tradition. And theswarakalpanawas striking. The ragaSaveriwas a well-planned exercise and theKrithi, Karunaya lokayawas a sensitive rendering. The choice of theraagam, tanam, pallaviwas rather  late in the programme. The concert was resplendent withghana ragas.Kalyaniwas chosen as the next item and the songEthaunnaraof Thyagaraja was perhaps too hard to ruminate.O jagadambainAnadabhairaviwas the right choice thereafter.Seshadri on the violin was  supportive. His style of playing was different in the sense the phrases came  off in bits and pieces resulting in the  loss of two important components, namely continuity andgamaka. Vankayala Narasimhulu on themridangamwas all-enthusiastic and thejatisandkoruvaishe contributed were very attractive.  The concert was entertaining and educative.Bottom Template Starts
