VThe17th Aradhana Sapthaha of the BTM Cultural Academy, Bangalore, featured a vocal concert by Gayathri Girish on Friday, accompanied by Nalina Mohan (violin), C. Cheluvaraju (mridanga), Vyasa Vittala (khanjari) and Karthik Mohan (ghata).The concert, devoted entirely to the compositions of Muthaiah Bhagavathar, commenced with &#8220;Manamohana&#8221;, the atta taala varna in Mohana, followed by &#8220;Sakthiganapathim&#8221; in Nattai raga and rupaka taala, to which were appended some free flowing kalpana swaras. A crisp alapana  in Vijayasaraswathi preceded the krithi &#8220;Saranam Vijayasaraswathi&#8221; in adi taala. The raga identity of Shahana was established in the very first phrase of its alapana, notable for mellifluous sancharas around the dhaivatha in the ascent and the lucidity of notes right down to the mandra panchama in the final phase. The krithi, &#8220;Manamu Kavalenu Thalli&#8221;, was succeeded by &#8220;Giripriyam Gangadharam&#8221; in Kadanakuthuhalam.&#8220;Sarasadalanayane&#8221; in Saramathi, one of the most beautiful renderings of the concert, underscored the widely spaced syllables of its sahithya and its leisurely gait. &#8220;Saravanabhava&#8221; in Pasupathipriya led to an elaborate alapana of Sankarabharana that revealed the artiste&#8217;s felicity of expression in all three octaves without exaggerated efforts at modulation, enhanced by the smooth overtones of her voice. &#8220;Manadirkisainda&#8221; a heavy composition in adi tala incorporated a detailed neraval and kalpana swaras with alternating passages in the tisra gathi. The concluding segment of the concert included, among others, &#8220;Vanchathonu&#8221; in Karnaranjani and a tillana in Hamsanandi. The efforts of the accomplished accompanying artistes would have had greater impact with better balancing and adjustment of the sound system.Sangeetha Shivakumar&#8217;s vocal concert on Saturday, accompanied by Akkarai Subhalakshmi (violin), Anoor Dattatreya Sharma (mridanga), B.N. Chandramouli (khanjari) and Bharadwaj Shathavalli (morsing), formed part of the same series.&#8220;Sankari Sankuru&#8221;, the celebrated krithi in Saveri raga and adi tala (tisra gathi), adorned with brisk kalpana swaras, provided a lively start to the concert which consisted solely of Shyama Shastri compositions, and contrasted well with the mellow pace of the following krithi, &#8220;Devi Brovasamayamide&#8221; in raga Chinthamani. A compact alapana of Kalyani that favoured bhriga oriented sancharas over softer melodious phrases prefaced &#8220;Birana Varalichi&#8221;, with neraval and a spate of kalpana swaras at &#8220;Shyamakrishnasodari&#8221;. A beautiful alapana of Yadukula Kamboji, replete with raga bhava, preceded a polished rendition of the swarajathi &#8220;Kamakshi&#8221;, accentuated by a clear voice and reverberating percussion, definitely one of the highlights of the concert.&#8220;Parvathi Ninnune&#8221; in Kalgada raga led to the main raga of the evening, Todi, elaborated with unhurried rests on pivotal notes, and remarkable for the emphasis on the tara sthayi madhyama. Some super fast passages attempted during the later stages of the alapana, however, tended to lack clarity and precision. The violinist introduced her own distinctive improvisational inputs to the item through her solo alapana, while remaining true to the intent of the lead artist. &#8216;Ninne Namminanu&#8217; set to misra chapu thala was rendered with a fulsome neraval and kalpana swaras at &#8216;Kamakshi Kanjadalayathakshi&#8217;, followed by a scintillating thani avarthana.The concert concluded with &#8216;Mayamma&#8217; in Ahiri raga and adi thala and &#8216;Kamakshi&#8217; in Madhyamavathi.
