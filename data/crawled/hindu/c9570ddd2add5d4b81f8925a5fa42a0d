VEschewing the traditional Jhod-jhala-ghath of the Thanthrikari Ang (instrumental pattern), the Ustad switched over to an exotic scale, sensing the pulse of the audience.The raga &#8216;Shubha-Lakshmi,&#8217; coined by the Ustad in honour of his spouse Subbulakshmi, resembled the Karna Ranjini of the South.  It had glistening sequences of melody. He wrapped up the concert with folk tunes (dhun) from Bengal and Assam. Mithilesh Kumar Jha and Dilip Vyas played the tabla .&#8216;Ghazal Sandhya&#8217;  by Talat Aziz had the maestro demonstrating his vocal prowess. &#8216;Sanchaaris&#8217; in Mohiniyattom by Deepthy Omchery Bhalla was followed by anritha prabanthaon the deity Aadi Keshava in Tiruvattar.A  choreographed Kuchipudi performance by Vaijayanthi Kashi was  appreciated by the audience.How the harmonious blending of bhava, raga and thala could elevate the art of Bharatnatyam to its zenith was demonstrated by Malavika Sarukai; each item was punctuated with  applause.Can a Hawaiian guitar and Gottu Vadyam (Chithra Veena) go hand in hand when presented through a jugalbandhi? Gottuvadyam had been enriched by maestros of the past like Tiruvidamaratoor Sakh Rama Rao (who trained Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer), Budallur Krishnamoorthy Sastrigal, (who advised Ravi Kiran on the subtleties of Gottu vadayam), Mannargudi Savithri Ammal, K.S. Narayana Iyengar ( paternal grandfather of Ravi Kiran).When Viswa Mohan Bhatt came up with &#8216;Nat Bhairav,&#8217; popularised by Pandit Ravi Shankar, Rudra Veena swung into action with Sarasangi, the South Indian equivalent of Nat Bhairav.Bhatt probed the raga from all angles in the typical &#8216;gaayaki&#8217; style and Ravi Kiran delved deep into lower tetra-chords, the emanations  resembled intonations of a human being.A raga malika would have added lustre to the programme. Subhash Chandran (younger brother of T.H. Vinayaka Ram) was scintillating on the ghatom and Ramkumar Mishra handed the tabla with ease.
