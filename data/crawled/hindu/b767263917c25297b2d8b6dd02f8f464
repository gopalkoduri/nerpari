VVocalist Abhishek Raghuram is all of 24, and you wonder how this Carnatic vocalist managed so much in such a short span of time. As a nine-year-old, Abhishek was already stunning his audiences, and they knew he was going to make it big.&#8220;As a child I imitated most legends and even managed to compare their styles. My family enjoyed my mimicry. At that point I felt I should start getting trained in vocal music,&#8221; recalls Abhishek. His grandfather simultaneously trained him in mridanga, and Harishankar polished the little Abhishek's khanjira interest. With all this, Abhishek was far too instinctive. &#8220;My guru P.S. Narayanaswamy gives his students a lot of freedom. He never curtails ingenuity, and encourages every student to be inventive,&#8221; explains Abhishek.Hailing from a family replete with well-known musicians (son of mridangist Ramkumar and violinist Usha of the Lalgudi family), Abhishek beams with pride speaking of his grandfather, the legendary Palghat Raghu. &#8220;I had something to learn from every minute that I spent with him, I really miss him. Even when he reclined into his armchair, his fingers were constantly at work and they intrigued me with their nuances. &#8221; Palghat Raghu would always insist that every artiste needed a solitude to search and discover. &#8220;He always said that thought and visualisation were necessary for manodharma. He believed that the preparation of a musician must be similar to that of a sculptor; the entire creation must be envisaged,&#8221; remembers Abhishek. What started of as informal training at home, gained a structured framework under the guidance of guru Narayanaswamy. &#8220;PSN never restricted us or locked us in a boundary; he guided us to tread the raga contours in a conventional, yet artistic way and opened us to newer realms,&#8221; says Abhishek.What are the styles he enjoys? &#8220;My guru is a shishya of Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer who had a majestic style and I love the GNB school too. PSN never believed that we have to stick to a school&#8230; if one hears his touches in Gowri Manohari or his unforgettable Nayaki and Darbar, it is enough for a lifetime,&#8221; he says.Abhishek gave his first public performance when he was nine in 1994, under the auspices of Percussive Arts Centre in Bangalore and hasn't looked back. He has toured the country and the U.S. for concerts along with Palghat Raghu. &#8220;The synchrony and understanding I had in my last concert with him in 2007 is unforgettable,&#8221; he says.In December 1999 he received the Best Junior vocalist award from the Music Academy in Chennai, the Yuva Kala Bharathi award from Bharat Kalachar in 2002 and the Asthana Vidwan title from Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam in 2006. More feathers to his creative cap were the tillanas he composed and the so many albums that he has brought out. Abhishek is also part of the Indian Spice team steered by Jayanthi Kumaresh that brings in new flavours to Indian music. &#8220;My concert planning is skeletal as the ambience forces us to change,&#8221; he says. What about his body language that is much discussed? &#8220;My swings are so natural&#8230;it shifts me away from the mikes so often&#8230;well, I am being more careful now,&#8221; says the prodigy who is all set to carve a niche for himself.
