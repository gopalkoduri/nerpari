VChennai-based Carnatic vocalist Sugandha Kalamegham began her concert with a varnam in Hindolam, composed by G.N. Balasubramaniam, known popularly as GNB.The piece, &#8216;Sakala kala vaniye,&#8217; a prayer to Goddess Saraswathi, was greeted with applause by the  audience  at Sree Karthika Tirunal Theatre, Thiruvananthapuram.An A-top artiste of All India Radio, she has been trained in both Carnatic and Hindustani music.  Accompaniment was  provided by Attukal Balasubramanian (violin), K. Sadagurucharan  (mridangam) and Kottayam Unnikrishnan (ghatom).Following the GNB piece, a Kanada raga composition &#8216;Varasidhi Vinayaka,&#8217; composed by  &#8216;Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar, was chosen by the vocalist.&#8216;Dayajoodamanchi,&#8217; a Syama Sastri kriti in Jaganmohini (Janyam of the 15th Melakartha Ragam Mayamalavagoula) in Chapu thalam was  admirably handled.The elaborate treatment of the Tyagaraja keerthanam in Varali, &#8216;Karunayela&#8217; in Adi tala, delighted  knowledgeable rasikas. A brief Swati piece &#8216;Kalayami Sriramam,&#8217; in Dhanyasi preceded the Varali composition.   Muthuswami Dikshitar&#8217;s  &#8216;Ananda Natana Prakasham&#8217; in Kedaram, set to Thriputa tala, was rendered before embarking on the major item of the evening.&#8216;Ethavunara,&#8217; the evergreen Tyagaraja kriti in Kalyani, was the piece de resistance of the two-and-a-half hour concert.The raga alapana was brief and sweet followed by the rendering of the sahithyam, niraval and manodharmaswaram. The Thaniavarthanam  was absorbing.The final part of the concert consisting of Thukadas began with a bewitching Kabirdas bhajan &#8216;Beeth Gaye Din&#8217; in the Hindustani raga Ahirbhairav. A thillana in Brindavani, composed by the violin maestro Lalgudi Jayaraman, was treated with great beauty.The recital  came to a close with the singing of &#8216;Neenamarupakulavu,&#8217; a Tyagaraja mangalam in Sourashtram.The programme was organised by Sri Swati Tirunal Sangita Sabha in memory of the late S. Vaidyanatha Iyer, who was the former chairman of the sabha.
