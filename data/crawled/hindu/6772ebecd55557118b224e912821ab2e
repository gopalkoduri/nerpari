VP.SURYA RAOIt is a laudable decision that the Department of Cultural Affairs, Andhra Pradesh has decided to celebrate Aradhanas of all famous Vaggeyakaras in all the Government Colleges and Schools of music in the State from this year.In Vijayawada, Ghantasala Venkateswara Rao Government College of Music and Dance  recently celebrated the Aradhana of Thyagaraja. The three-day musical feast attracted large crowds. Nemani Nagalakshmi of Tadepalligudem,  rendered a Harikatha on Thyagaraja's life, singing and explaining the spiritual messages of some of his well-known compositions.  B.Sitaramalakshmi and S.Prasad accompanied her violin and mridangam respectively. The second day's concert was a scholarly vocal by Malladi Suribabu a senior singer and father of the popular Malladi brothers.  He was accompanied by H.Ramcharan on the violin and N.S.Kalyanaraman (mridangam) and Lakshmishankar (morsing).The vocal concert was followed by a melodious flute concert by Manda Anantakrishna, son of late flute vidwan Manda Balaramasarma. Anantakrishna blowing was tuneful and sounded sweet and soothing to the ear.  He was well supported by V.Krishnaveni on the violin and N.S.Kalyanaraman on the mridangam.The last day's programme began with an enjoyablebrindaganamof Thyagarajakeertanasby the college students and it was followed by a vocal duet concert by Nallan brothers Pranav Krishna and Kausik Kalyan who, of late, showexcellent talent and promise. Their delineation ofMohanapreceeding thekriti Mohana Ramawas neat and exhaustive but the sounded like pre-fabricated pieces.  Good support came from violinist Ramcharan and mridangist Suresh.
