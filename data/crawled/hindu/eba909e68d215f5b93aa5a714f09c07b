VG. SWAMINATHANEven in thematic pursuit, Gayathri Girish preferred to be little different by selecting and presenting Tamil songs from their early evolution. In her programme for Saraswathi Vaggeyakkara Trust and Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha at the Asthika Samajam of Venus Colony, she started with a viruttam &#8216;Mandiramavathum Mamarundavathum,&#8217; a verse belonged to the Siddar&#8217;s period composed by Thirumoolar followed by a poem of Pattinathar. The song was set to be in &#8216;Pazhanthakkappann,&#8217; referred to as Arabi.The next one was a Thevaram of seventh century  by Thirugnanasambandar in raga Pazhampanjaram alias Sankarabharanam. Tamil being a versatile language, the punning of a word known as &#8216;yamaham&#8217; had been widely used in this one.To fulfill the format of the concert, Gayathri took up Manirangu for alapana. Her linear approach to the melody was profound in bringing out the special nuances of the raga  distinguishing it from its close relatives, Sri and Madhyamavati. Here too her choice was a new one from the 18th century composer Oothukadu Venkatakavi, &#8216;Yarenna Sonnalum Anjaathe Maname&#8217; carrying the usual lilt of the Oothukadu kritis. Arunachalakavi&#8217;s &#8216;Yaro Ivar Yaro&#8217; was sung in Saveri and not in the usually heard raga, Bhairavi.Gayathri deserves appreciation for her effort to fit the songs of different genres into the cutcheri format without sacrificing the beauty of the verses and at the same time set them in tune with the classical music grammar.Akkarai Subbulakshmi keeps improving  in her understanding of the musical wisdom and her support on the violin was striking. Efficient Neyveli Skandasubramaniam on mridangam and Madipakkam Murali on ghatam added value to the programme.Maintaining the tempoPriya Sisters&#8217; concerts always firmly rest on their penchant for keeping the tempo without being flaccid at any point. Their song selection for the &#8216;Isai Thamizh Vizha&#8217; varied from well-known to unknown. &#8216;Senthil Nagar Mevum,&#8217; the Nilambari varnam of Lalgudi Jayaraman and &#8216;Vaaranamukhane Va&#8217; in Nattai with a small swara supplement set the ball rolling. &#8216;Arivar Uaar Unnai Arivar&#8217; in Mukhari and the exposition of Subhapanthuvarali by Shanmugapriya provided the opportunity to the sisters to add substance to the concert.Shanmugapriya explored the mantra and madyama segment competently and left the tara sthayee phrasings to Haripriya. The essence of the solemn character of the raga was further enhanced by the emotion-packed composition &#8216;Enna Punniyam Seitheno&#8217;  by Swami Ranganatha. Khambodi was meticulously spread out by Haripriya with careful embellishments at the upper register phrases. Raghavendra Rao (violin)  seemed to have his own visions of ragas.  Neyveli Skandasubramaniam and S.V. Ramani were ebullient percussionists and virtually thundered during their &#8216;thani avartanam.&#8217;One word to organisers: Please pay attention to the acoustics.Bottom Template Starts
