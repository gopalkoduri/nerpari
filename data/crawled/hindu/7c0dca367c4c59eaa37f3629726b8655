VM ohan Santhanam's vocal concert at Hamsadhwani warmed up with an array of kritis in quick progression -- &#8216;Vanajaksha' (Ritigowla Ata Tala varnam), &#8216;Maha Ganapathim' (Nattai), &#8216;Sobillu Sapthaswara' (Jaganmohini) with swaras, &#8216;Endaro Mahanubhavulu' (Sri) and &#8216;Sakala Grahapala' (Atana) before detailing Simhendramadhyamam.Oothukkadu Venkatakavi's &#8216;Asainthadum Mayil Ondru' had the necessary lilt with sketchy niraval and swaras.Those who are familiar with Mohan Santhanam's music will be aware of his penchant for novel exploits. Therefore, a raga like Simhendramadhyamam that offers much scope for expansion was given just a quick wrap up and he moved on to the alapana of Navarasakannada as a prelude to Tyagaraja's &#8216;Ninnu Vina Nama.'Blame it on the raga; notwithstanding Mohan's ingenuity, the raga could offer only partial avenues to explore. However, Mohan made it up with his egalitarian approach by allowing violinist Sanjeev to make expeditions into the sangatis in the anupallavi &#8216;Kanulakoni' which go well with instrumental deliverance than vocal deliberation and later shared interesting swara sallies with Sanjeev.Plenty of brigasAfter &#8216;Marugelara' of Tyagaraja in Jayantasri, the vocalist went on to Mohanam. It is difficult for any musician to be indifferent to Mohanam's charm and range. Mohan's Mohanam was packed with fast rolling brigas and akaras sans stopovers.A few segments of leisurely floats would have emphasised the beauty of Mohanam. Anyway, the kriti chosen was &#8216;Ra Ra Rajeevalochana' by Mysore Vasudevachar with fetching sangatis and chittaswaram at the end.Mohan's swara exercises were impressively planned and executed. The gandhara-oriented kuraippu swaras and final korvai were presented with tastefully framed syllables. The tail-end numbers were &#8216;Kanda Naal Mudalai' in Madhuvanti and the Revati thillana of Lalgudi Jayaraman.Sanjeev's violin playing was done with commendable understanding. His raga essays and swaras were elegant.He touched upon some finer nuances of Mohanam in his interpretation. A.S. Ranganathan on the mridangam and Madipakkam Murali paired well in their percussive support and offered a robust thani avartanam sharing equal credit.
