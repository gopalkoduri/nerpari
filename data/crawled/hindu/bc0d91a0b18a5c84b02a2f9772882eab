VAnanthalaksmi SadagopanRajalakshmi Audio, Coimbatore.MRP Rs. 100.Ananthalaksmi Sadagopan, a senior vocalist and a disciple of Sattur Subramaniam has never known to compromise on classical values and has striven throughout her performing career to present Carnatic music in an undiluted manner. She has also been largely instrumental in the popularisation of the compositions of Ambujam Krishna.Rajalaksmi Audio have come out with a compact disc of Ananthalaksmi&#8217;s renderings of Ambujam Krishna&#8217;s creations titled, &#8216;Nadarupini.&#8217; This compact disc is a compilation of the vocalist&#8217;s earlier recordings on  gramophone records or plates as they used to be referred.Ananthalaksmi&#8217;s voice is just what many aspiring singers would like to have been blessed with. The ease with which the vocalist handles long karvais with total sruti adherence and the timbre of her voice which makes her negotiate confidently the ravai sangathis and brigas are a listener&#8217;s delight.The opening song, &#8216;Paanam Seiyya Varir&#8217; in Simhendramadhyamam is sung by the artiste with the just right gamaka (oscillation) of the gandhara note, without any trace of the suddha madhyamam creeping in. The following Arabhi composition, &#8216;En Thaai Ni Andro&#8217; has the artiste reminding the listener that she is from the Sattur Subramaniam stable. A brief alapana of Saraswathi paves the way for the title song of this disc, &#8216;Nadarupini&#8217; in praise of the Goddess of learning. The alapana and kalpanaswaras are precise and to the point.&#8216;Maargam Kattiduvai&#8217; (Hindolam) with a swarakshara opening is an appealing presentation. Songs in Kanada (&#8216;Namam Uraithidu&#8217;), &#8216;Karumugil Vannan&#8217; (Sriranjani) and a Telugu composition, &#8216;Entha Bhagyamu&#8217; in Begada, with a chittaswara are spirited  renderings.The vinyasa of Thodi is built up methodically in an unhurried fashion and is wound up with a cascade of brigas with perfect swarasthana suddham.&#8216;Alaiya Viduthal&#8217; is the chosen song where the composer questions the Lord, if it is fair on His part to make her wander indefinitely in this mundane world.The mood of the composition is amply reflected in the vocalisation. The niraval and kalpanaswaras are models to be emulated. Ananthalakshmi sticks to just sarvalaghu swaras sans any kanakku or porutham.The closing numbers are in Suddhasaveri (&#8216;Gudithodi Vaarai&#8217;) on Muruga and a ragamalika (&#8216;Kannan Idam Eduthu Solladi&#8217;) twined in Chenjurutti, Punnagavarali and Nadanamakriya.The violinist T. Rukmini offers a brief but convincing vinyasa of Thodi. Her replies to the kalpanaswaras of the vocalist for the Thodi and Saraswathi songs are flawless.Karaikkudi Kanakambujam provides the mridangam accompaniment without much of a sollu variation for all the numbers. Her percussive accompaniment is timidly unobtrusive.What the CD inlay card fails to furnish are the facts that songs 1-5, 7-9 and 20 were set to music by V.V.Sadagopan with K.R.Kedaranathan taking the credit for song 6. And the producer of first edition is Sujatha Vijayaraghavan.PVK
