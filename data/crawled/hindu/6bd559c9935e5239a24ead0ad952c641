VIt&#8217;s not often that music lovers are treated to a clarinet concert, considering that the number of artistes are quite few. A concert held at Kalabharathi recently by Visakha Music and Dance Academy featured Kota Atchibabu, an &#8216;A&#8217; gr\u000aade artiste of Akashvani and a staffer at its studio in Hyderabad. Mavuduri Satyanarayana Sarma on violin, G. Venkata Rao on mridangam and S. Hanumantha Rao on ghatam lent excellent support.Exhibiting remarkable ambidexterity along with masterly variation in the technique of blowing air into the instrument, he exploited all subtle features of sound production and modulation while meticulously following all norms of exposition of carnatic music. He knowledgeably rendered an enthralling recital. Emanating a mellifluence of some of the finest nuances of Carnatic music sustained with clarion clarity and spiritual fervour, he made connoisseurs of the art remember his guru Shaik Madeena and the unique clarinet maestro A.K.C. Natarajan on many an occasion.From the word go, starting with Natakujaranji varnam and playingVathapiwith a brief but beautiful ragam and elaborate swaram excitingly in the two tempos next, Atchibabu established excellent rapport with his accompanists. The piece de resistance of the evening was the expansive expatiation ofKaligiyuntekada(Keeravani) prefixed with elated ragalapana and suffixed with invigorating neravu and swaram. His sojourns in Trisra and Khandagathis shifting from the original Chaturasram and adapting the gathibheda into ragas like Sahana, Kapi, Behag and Revathi with grahabheda techniques delighted all alike. The thani that followed with Venkata Rao in the lead also turned out to be a scintillating exercise. He also played Thyagaraja PancharathakrithiEndaro Mahanubhavulu,Annapurne Visalakshi(Sama) of Dikshitar  andMarivereof Syama Sastry (Anandabhairavi) which stood out.
