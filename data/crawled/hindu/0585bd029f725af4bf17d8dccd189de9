VThe melodious Sunil Kant Saxena, sitar exponent, hits a raw note when he talks of the state of classical music these days. As the first of his family to take up music as a profession, he has felt the isolation of not being a &#8216;gharanedar' professional. Yet, like others drawn to the art by love rather than through lineage, he says he finds ultimate solace in his music. &#8220;When I pick up my sitar and play, each time I feel it is for the first time,&#8221; he remarks, &#8220;and I feel at peace.&#8221; There is no ambivalence in the anger and the serenity. They seem to go hand in hand.&#8220;The big organisers of music events only invite the big names. They earn on the basis of these big names,&#8221; he says, and points out performance as an essential requirement of an artiste's training. &#8220;If other artistes get a chance to perform, say, once a year, how will they polish their art? They are not machines to turn on at the flick of a switch.&#8221;Still, says Saxena, giving credit to the Almighty, he is managing to run his family. &#8220;But I worry about artistes of the younger generations. What will they do? There are not enough opportunities, no insurance plans. Organisations should come forward to create a safety net for artistes. I am ready to do what is required for this, because I feel it is necessary to look beyond oneself.&#8221;Saxena, who trained under B.N. Dutta, Pandit Uma Shanker Misra and Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, recently performed at the Gandhi Hindustani Sahitya Sabha, where he also presented his 13-year-old son Sparsh in a short solo. &#8220;He played raga Durga and a Ram dhun,&#8221; says the fond father.Besides his son, the guru has a number of other disciples. &#8220;It is not easy to attain a good standard in classical music,&#8221; he says, a tad defensively. Many of his students are professionals in other fields or studying to be engineers, doctors, fashion designers. However, he mentions a notable accomplishment for any teacher. His disciple Vinod Saroha is doing his PhD in music, and his guide at Rohtak University, Bharati Sharma, is also a shagird of Saxena.The guru is currently busy preparing some 12 of his students to participate in the recording of a song for the Commonwealth Games. As a teacher, he does not charge fees. &#8220; Vidya daan is the highest form of giving, so I don't want ever to be in a position of having to charge for teaching. By God's grace, I can afford not to charge, but what of those who need to? Also, today many who teach for a fee make a business out of it.&#8221;These are some of the things that upset him. Saxena, whose album &#8220;Tatwa &#8211; Fire&#8221; by Isha Music is available in the market and whose other classical album is available online with Music Design Workshop, feels the system of payments to artistes also needs to be made professional. Often after recordings and programmes, artistes are made to wait indefinitely for remuneration. &#8220;Why should they be expected to hang around and keep asking?&#8221;In the midst of the reality show boom, classical music should have some benefactors, in the form of channels or programme designers who can create popular formats for this art. As for the children in his own family &#8212; his niece and nephew Aditi and Piyush also learn the sitar &#8212; he says though Delhi youngsters have plenty of distractions, it is up to the adults to introduce them to classical arts. &#8220;It is not good to criticise any kind of music. But we are told our music is a path to attain divinity, whereas this is not said of popular music. And not everything that sells is good. I firmly believe these things and try to guide the youngsters.&#8221;Having lived in Europe and the U.S. on short stints to teach and perform, he says he declined offers of permanent jobs because he prefers to live in India. &#8220;The other countries too are cultured and beautiful and life is comfortable there, but then our nation is mahaan no doubt,&#8221; he points out, referring to India's spiritual heritage.
