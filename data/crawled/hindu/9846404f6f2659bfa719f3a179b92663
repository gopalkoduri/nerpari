VThe music rasikas in  Vellore were entertained to an enthralling flute recital by 15-year-old G. Adithyaram, a class X  student of Vidya Mandir,  Chennai, at the Ranga Jewellery-V.R. Jeyarama Chetty Kalyana Mandapam in Vellore recently.Accompanied by an equally prodigious young team comprising Akshaya Ram (disciple of Umayalpuram Sivaraman) on the mridangam, Shyam (disciple of M. Chandrasekaran) on the violin and Krishna (disciple of V. Suresh) on the ghatam, Adithyaram gave a good impression with the  very first song, &#8216;Karunimpa Idhi,&#8217; a varnam by Tyagaraja, in Sahana, set to Adi talam.With a mature and flawless rendering of his next song, &#8216;Endaro Mahaanu Bhavulu,&#8217;  he  took the audience to raptures.  Those in the audience, who thought that this was his longest song, were in for a big surprise when he, along with his young accompanists, presented  &#8216;Pakkala Nilabadi&#8217; by Tyagaraja as the main song. The song in Kharaharapriya, set to Misrachapu talam, was marked not only by a lengthy  delineation by the flautist, but also by tani avartanam.  It was a delight  watching the three accompanists  play their instruments with consummate ease, encouraged  by their friends and the audience. Krishna distinguished himself with an ebullient solo recital on the ghatam for the main piece.Adithyaram took up songs mostly composed by Tyagaraja,  but rendered  the famous &#8216;Krishna Nee Begane Baro&#8217; of Purandaradasa, in an excellent manner, and a Tillana composed by his  guru, Alathoor G. Nagarajan, who was present at the concert, enjoying and encouraging his disciple.The  concert was organised jointly by  Raman &amp; Co. and Ranga Prasad Jewel Palace, Vellore. D. Maninathan, secretary, D.K.M. College for Women inaugurated the concert. S. Varadan, secretary, Sahana Sangeetha Sabha, stressed the need for frequently organising such concerts in Vellore. V.A. Gopal, proprietor,  Raman &amp; Co. said  a Marwadi Ayyappa Bhajan will be held in Vellore after three months.
