VThere are so many ways in which one could make CD packaging an interesting combo. Thematic assemblage is something we notice these days, and what we have in Carnatic vocalist Chitra Srikrishna's latest offer is her bringing together of several kritis on Lord Anjaneya from a variety of composers for her audio CD &#8220;Anjaneya Aarathi&#8221;(CD, Swathi Sanskriti Series, Rs. 150). She is accompanied by Charulatha Ramanujam on the violin and C. Cheluvaraju on the mridanga.&#8220;Anjaneya is one of the champion-hero's of our epic Ramayana and in his qualities of being a prime bhaktha towards his Lord, he embodies unalloyed devotion and is a symbol of courage and commitment. Most of the saint-composers have kritis on the monkey-God in several languages that reflects His universal appeal,&#8221; says Chitra Srikrishna who has with care selected some interesting kritis of Mysore Vasudevachar, Purandaradasa, Muthuswamy Dikshitar, Tyagaraja, Swathi Tirunal and Tanjore S. Kalyanaraman.Hanuman is believed to be the son of Vayu, and vayu (air) is quintessential survival-element that is described as praana (life force) in Purandaradasa's &#8220;Prana Naatha Paaliso Nee Yenna&#8221; in Nattakuranji. The Lord's soldierly characteristics are illustrated in Dikshitar's &#8220;Veera Hanumathe Namo Namo&#8221; in Kaanada, and the raga and the sahitya blend so intrinsically in Chitra's voice bringing out the bhakthi-bhava of the kriti just so well.The clarity in her voice continues with Saveri, a serious raga that is sketched aptly enough for Swati Tirunal's &#8220;Anjaneya Raghurama&#8221; where in the variety of sangatis offered by the composer brings out the raga scale with the lyrics to some bracing devotional moments.Behag and Shudh Sarang are the lighter ragas that suit Purandaradasa'a &#8220;Eetha Mukhya Prananatha&#8221; and &#8220;Maruthi Varuvan&#8221; of Tanjore Kalyanaraman, where both kritis offer simple, but powerful and persuasive content for describing His qualities. Chitra, a disciple of O.S. Tyagarajan is presently being trained by Seethalakshmi Venkatesan in Bangalore. The formally trained technical writer is also a graded artist of AIR and has won several accolades at Bangalore Gayana Samaja and Chennai's Music Academy.***Chitra's devotional CD &#8220;Saranaagathi&#8221; (Swati Sanskriti Series, Rs. 150) contains Kulashekara Alwar's Perumal Thirumozhi (devotional hymns) that epitomises &#8216;surrender' as the central precept. It is a part of the Divya Prabhandam, a collection of hymns written by Alwar mystics of Sri Vaishnava tradition. Kulashekara Alwar is the ninth of the 12 Alwars, a devotee of Narayana. Originally a Chera King, he renounces his throne to become a philosopher and a saint, and his 105 hymns are known for their lyrical quality and exquisite imagination in Tamil.Thirty verses from this Alwar's have been selected for the devotional rendering by Chitra, and 30 different ragas bring the verses to some enjoyable musical form by Ashok Subramanian. Ghana ragas such as Todi, Kalyani to lighter ones such as Revati, Chandrakauns and even the rare Vaasanthi come up. This is the first CD in the Saranaagathi series by Chitra (in collaboration with Ashok Subramanian of San Jose) which begins with an English explanation and a brief introduction by Velukkudi Krishnan in Tamil.
