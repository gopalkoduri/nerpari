VHis performance, in connection with the Sree Krishna Jayanti celebrations at Bhaktha Meera Temple at Vyttila in Kochi, was a happy blend of the prescribed and applied aspects of Carnatic music.The unhurried manner in which he presented &#8216;Jagadaanandakaaraka&#8217; (Naatta) showed that it  could be rendered with sufficient emotional back-up. His voice is thin but not feeble and he has formulated a style  of his own to suit his voice. &#8216;Paahi Sree Girirajasuthe,&#8217;  composed by Syama Sasthri in Ananda Bhairavi, clicked.It was followed by  a classic Bahudaari.  &#8216;Brova Bhaaramaa&#8217;  finds Tyagaraja in an indignant mood and its rendering did  justice to the lyrics. Kalyani had a few glittering passages, and a mellifluous &#8216;Katahaya-kathaya&#8217; (Tharangam by Narayana Theerthar) was decorated with swaras.Dikshitar compositions find Vijay Siva in his  elements. Naturally so, as DKP had learned under Ambi Dikshitar, a descendent of the Dikshitar legacy.  Thus &#8216;Sree Kamalambaa&#8217; in Ahiri and &#8216;Saarasa Dalanayanaa&#8217; in Khamas  stood out. He summed up the recital with &#8216;Maamava Pattabhirama&#8217; (Manirangu) and &#8216;Seethakalyana&#8217; (Kurinji).In the Lalgudi style, the first sweep of the bow brings forth the &#8216;jeevan&#8217; of a raga.  Vijayalakshmi goaded the vocalist to traverse  the domain of kalpana swaras. Trichur C. Narendran shows a penchant towards an array of &#8216;cholkettu&#8217; during the thani on the mridangam and his skill in weaving rhythmic patterns  was matched by Thripunithura Radhakrishnan on the ghatom.
