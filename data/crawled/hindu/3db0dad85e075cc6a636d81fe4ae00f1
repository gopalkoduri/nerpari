VMalavika, college student, featured in the morning, said that she has been singing the compositions for nearly four years along with her guru Padmavathi Ananthagopalan. &#8220; It is not easy to get the diction right but the lyrics do spread positive vibrations,&#8221; she said.The vocalists of the evening were O.S.Thiyagarajan, Maharajapuram S. Ramachandran, Sangeetha Sivakumar, Mambalam Sisters, P. Unnikrishnan, Neyveli R. Santhanagopalan and the Malladi Brothers Sri Ravikumar and Sri Ramprasad. Some of them took up just four compositions and expanded on them  with niraval, swaraprasthara and alapana. And there were those who packed around ten songs.&#8220;The musicians have really worked hard to give the bhajans the kirtana flavour,&#8221; said one of the trustees. The rendition by OST of the composition &#8216;Kamakshim Karunadham Kalayeham&#8217; was simply superb, with Thodi giving the essence of bhakti.Maharajapuram Ramachandran&#8217;s made a melodious exposition of  &#8216;Rajeswari Sri Rajeswari Raja Kiridae&#8217; in Dharmavathi.  The Ragam, thanam, pallavi in Kalyani of the composition &#8216;Kalimbajee&#8217; by Mambalam Sisters was soul stirring. They also rendered songs in Atana, Sindubhairavi and Vatapi. &#8220;It was like preparing for any thematic concert. But we worked together for a month to achieve perfection,&#8221; said Vijayalakshmi, one of the duo. &#8220;As such the ragas to which these bhajans have been set have a therapeutic effect we have not changed them but only embellished them,&#8221; said the Sisters. And Sri Ganapati Sachidananda is known for his faith in music as a great healer.&#8220;The Swamiji has composed more than 5,000 songs in several Indian languages &#8212; Sanskrit, Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, etc. The lyrics are woven with Beejakshara and it gives immense power to the singer and listener,&#8221; said one of the trustees. Semmangudi and M.S.Subbulakshmi included these songs in their repertoire. he SGST has been organising inter-school competitions every year during August to inspire children,&#8221; said Mr. Jayaraman one of the trustees.The trust has also released a number of CDs &#8220;Shiva Jyoti,&#8221; &#8220;Tripura&#8221; and &#8220;Nada Manjari&#8221; being some of the titles. The albums  are available at the Ashram in Velacherry.
