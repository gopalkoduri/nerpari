VHailing from a family in which her father is a musician and mother a dancer, and  favoured by her strong and sonorous voice supported by commendable modulation, Jayamangala exuded full confidence, composure and competence in her program. Her predilection to provide good music was evident in all aspects of her presentation. Right from vocal projection with free flow of voice, wisdom on the raga bhava, perfection in kriti rendition and great control in spinning swara strings testified her potential candidature for a bright future in vocal music. Many may not be aware that Jayamangala is also an accomplished mridangam player. Therefore, the laya aspect of her singing is flawless. Her guru in mridangam is Mannargudi Eswaran.Sunada Vinodhini was taken up for alapana for the kriti, &#8216;Karunakara Kamala Manohara&#8217; (a composition of Jayamangala&#8217;s grandmother Rajalakshmi Krishnan) supplemented by an efficient niraval and swaras on the line &#8216;Parama Purusha Ssowre.&#8217;The kriti had a nicely set chittaswaram also. Jayamangala&#8217;s  raga alapanas could sustain the listener&#8217;s attention through their systematic spiralling of phrases eschewing unwieldy digressions.Later, the main raga Mohanam was nurtured with fondness and developed with perfect proportions of touching karvais and pleasing brigas thrown in between.The articulation well established Jayamangala&#8217;s raga imageries were ingeniously structured within the grammar of classical contours. Another laudable quality of Jayamangala is framing of swara segments. Without putting extra loads with mundane syllables, she could build up swaras of varying patterns with arithmetic acumen delectably converging into final korvai.This was impressively visible in the Mohana raga kriti, &#8216;Nannu Paalimpa&#8217; of Tyagaraja with short changes of nadai and the finale with finesse centred on dhaivatam.But for a few frenzied bowing at times, Kalyani Shankar&#8217;s violin support was by and large very satisfactory. Her swara repartees in Mohanam showed her maturity. Manikkudi S. Chandrasekaran on the  mridangam melded well with the mood of the concert. His precise thani avaratanam was notable.&#8216;Kaya Roha Nesam&#8217; in Devagandharam (Abheri) in Dikshitar&#8217;s parlance, &#8216;Nee Kelana&#8217; in Devamanohari of Poochi Iyengar filled the pre-thani session.The tukkadas &#8216;Payo Rasi Paale&#8217; in Dvijavanthi, a kriti of Kalyani Varadarajan, a contemporary composer, &#8216;Mera Gadu Lechi Rara&#8217; (Thanjavur  Quartet) in Atana, &#8216;Bo Sambho&#8217; in Revati and a delightful thillana in Khamas were included in the concluding part of the concert.
