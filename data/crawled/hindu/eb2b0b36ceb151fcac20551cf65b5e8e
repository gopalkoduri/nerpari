VThe occasion was  the inauguration of the Mayavaram Fiddle Govindaraja Pillai Trust. Pillai, incidentally, was a good friend of Krishnan.&#8216;Gajananayutham&#8217; (Chakravaham-Adi-Dikshitar) was the first kriti after a brief alapana. The swara phase, drenched  in the raga, was set at a  brisk pace. A striking aspect of Krishnan&#8217;s style  is his habit of showcasing the raga right in the first phrase of the alapana, instead of keeping the rasika guessing till about the fifth or the sixth. Shanmukhapriya (Saravana Bhava-Adi-Sivan) was one such. The soul-stirring phrases kindled one&#8217;s emotions.The delineation of Thodi with every phrase soaked in tradition was a delightful treat. The moment he commenced &#8216;Koluvamaragada&#8217; (Adi-Tyagaraja), one was transported  to  those  occasions  when Ariyakkudi sang  song to Krishnan&#8217;s accompaniment.The  mood was sustained in the niraval and the swara segment, ornate with subtleties. Andal&#8217;s Tiruppavai, &#8220;Oruthi Maganai Pirandhu,&#8221; imaginatively tuned by Ariyakkudi in Behag was a vintage offering and so was Suratti that followed. How can the professor&#8217;s concert be complete without Sindubhairavi? And there was a request from a rasika too.The dynamics and the long traverses left the listener breathless. Desh was a sedate fare while the Jonpuri tillana was played at a speed that would put violinists half his age to shame.The subtle  side of Tiruvarur Bhaktavatsalam comes to fore whenever he accompanies TNK.A subdued approach with feather-light touches and friendly pats on the chapu mark  such occasions. It was no different that day too in the company of Vaikkom Gopalakrishnan when they both combined beautifully to present a thani that was outstanding.The founder trustee Washington T. P. Shanmughanathan, while welcoming the gathering to the glittering function, spoke about Pillai&#8217;s punctuality and discipline. He also announced  that the Trust will help indigent musicians and  conduct an annual music festival,  beginning  2009.The picture of Govindaraja Pillai was unveiled by Prof. T. N. Krishnan, who also distributed violins  to five students of the Tamil Nadu Government Music College. The instruments had been donated by the Trust.In his presidential address Nalli Kuppusamy suggested that the Trust build an auditorium in Adyar, which will be very useful to music fraternity.K.Chandrasekaran, G.M., IOB, Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman, A. Natarajan, director, (retd) Doordarshan Kendra, Chennai, Tiruppambaram Shanmugasundaram, Prof.T.N.Krishnan and Sikkil Bhaskaran offered  felicitations.
