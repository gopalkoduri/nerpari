VSmriti Nandan Cultural Centre, Bangalore, in association with Sri Rajarajeshwari Kala Nikethan, presented a Kuchipudi recital by Surya N. Rao last week in Bangalore. He was accompanied by Sanjay (vocal), Sandeep (flute), Hari (mridanga), and Prasanna (rhythm pads). Explanations on the salient features of the art form were provided by Veena Murthy, who also wielded the cymbals.A brief account of the evolution of Kuchipudi and the decisive role played Siddhendra Yogi preceded the invocatory Pushpanjali, performed to Sri Ganesha Sharanam in Thilang raga and aditala, which attested to the artiste&#8217;s rhythmic competence and agility. The Pravesa Daru introduced the character of Babhruvahana, son of Arjuna Chitrangada, and was notable for the inclusion of vachika abhinaya, one of the specialities of the Kuchipudi style. The dialogue of the protagonist, couched here in English instead of the usual Telugu, was delivered with clarity and emotional intensity.&#8220;Ela Needayaradu&#8221;, the Tyagaraja krithi in Athana raga and adi tala, incorporated brief depictions of Rama as the saviour of the world and the protector of yagas, along with glimpses of the Pattabhisheka. The Tharangam based on a Purandaradasa devaranama, featured an interesting interaction with the orchestra, with complex rhythms clearly executed on the brass plate. The concepts of &#8216;tandava&#8217; and &#8216;lasya&#8217; were elucidated before a representation of &#8216;Sandhya Thandava&#8217;, one of the seven types of thandava performed by Lord Shiva - a demanding and vibrant item calling for unflagging stamina and skill. On the whole, the recital vouched for the abundant talent, training and dedication.T.T. Srinivasan, accompanied by M.T.Rajakesari (mridanga) and S. Shrishylan (ghata), presented a violin concert under the joint auspices of the Karnataka Gana Kala Parishath and the Tyagaraja Gana Sabha on Saturday.The recital commenced with Veena Kuppayyar&#8217;s rare ghanaragamalika varna in nine ragas, &#8220;Inthakopamelara&#8221; set to aditaala followed by Purandaradasa&#8217;s &#8220;Gajavadana Beduve&#8221; in Kedaram.&#8220;Janakiramana&#8221; the Tyagaraja krithi in Shuddhaseemanthini raga and adi tala was supplemented with lively kalpana swaras at &#8220;Rakthanalinadala&#8221;. &#8220;Bhajanaseyarada&#8221; in Athana and &#8220;Nadadinamata&#8221; in Janaranjani, preceded a melodious alapana of Bhushavali that etched a compact but complete picture of the raga. The Swathi Tirunal composition &#8220;Gopanandana&#8221; set to aditaala, rendered in a sedate tempo highlighting the lilting cadence of the composition, and kalpana swaras in different gatis, bore testimony to the artiste&#8217;s expertise.&#8220;Pattividuvaradu&#8221; in Manjari served as prelude to a raga tana pallavi in Sankarabharanam, the main item of the concert. The alapana, of moderate length, was cast in the traditional mould with smooth bowing, delectable phrasing, and rests at the pivotal points of the scale including the gandhara, panchama, taara shadja and gandhara. The pallavi beginning &#8220;Thyagaraja Gana Vaibhavam&#8221;, a tribute to the two organising sabhas, was set to tishra jathi triputa tala and featured the requisite technical components, followed by kalpana swaras and a masterful tani avarthana. Better acoustics at the venue would no doubt have enhanced the overall impact of the performance, which concluded with &#8220;Vande Matharam&#8221; (Desh), &#8220;Jayathi Jayathi Bharatha Matha&#8221; (Khamas) and a javali in Paras.
