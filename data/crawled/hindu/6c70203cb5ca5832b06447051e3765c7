VShyamprakash Artikaje&#8217;s vocal concert at Ganabharathi prompted for contrasting observations related to planning of the concert, general narrative style, approach to the lyrics and individual trends. He was accompanied by H.K. Narasimha Murthy (\u000aviolin) and H.L. Shivashankara Swamy (mridanga).The young artiste&#8217;s voice is bold, dignified, and possesses the required gamut and appreciable consistency.Shyamprakash commenced his recital with the atta thala varna (&#8220;Viriboni&#8221; - Bhairavi - Pachimiriyam Adiappayya) and amply justified its strong construction by a thorough grip over the raga and the laya, strengthened by in-depth gamakas. In the varna, he proved himself with enough potential to tread the footprints of reputed vidwans. &#8220;Shri Mahaganapathim&#8221; (Athana - Jayachamaraja Wadiyar), &#8220;Shringapuradhishwari Sharade&#8221; (Kalyani - Padmacharan), &#8220;Dinamani Vamsha&#8221; (Harikamboji - Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Shri Guruguha Palayashumam&#8221; (Shuddha Saveri &#8211; Dikshitar) sufficiently vouched for the artiste&#8217;s hard practice and commitment.The tempo not changing from its hitherto medium to fast pace, an element of monotony started percolating into the progressions. Further, inadequate attentions to pauses while presenting the lyrics, redundant cursory articulations, skimming over the swarasthanas, priority to rhythm over the mood and unnecessary speed played the spoilsport.The consequences: alapana in Hindola (&#8220;Ramanukku Mannan&#8221;, Arunachala Kavi) suffered discrepancies in shruthi; neraval at &#8220;Ilalo Sarivaralalo&#8221; (&#8220;Chalakallaladu&#8221; &#8211; Arabhi - Thyagaraja) lost its clarity; and &#8220;Nagumomu&#8221; (Abheri - Thyagaraja) could not carry the right mood.Had the artiste consistently followed the same ideals which he adapted in &#8220;Kaddanuvariki&#8221; (Thodi &#8211; Thyagaraja &#8211; with pleasing alapana, clear narration of the lyrics, meaningful neraval at Padhuthappaga and suitable swarakalpana) the entire concert would have been remarkable.Manjula Surendra and Vani Yadunandan presented veena jugalbandhi under the auspices of Sushira Sri V. Desikachar&#8217;s Academy of Music, at Veene Sheshanna Bhavana. The music ensemble consisted V.S. Rajagopal (mridanga) and V. S. Ramesh (ghata).&#8220;Nere Nammi&#8221; (Kaanada - Ramanad Srinivasa Iyengar) flashed a positive signal in support of their commitment and practice: absolute synchronisation, remarkable sancharas and fine gamakas.Feature in common: As far as coordination between the manodharma and its materialisation is concerned - the hands did not obey what the mind demanded and commanded, thus undermining precise and fluent sancharas. Yet, the lyrical sections came alive.Development of raga Kedara followed by &#8220;Rama Nipaithanaku&#8221; imparted warmth to the concert. It was admirably built on deep and subtle graces carried through a gentle progression ending in neatly woven kalpanaswaras.Scenario slightly changed in Abheri (&#8220;Bhajare Manasa&#8221; &#8211; Mysore Vasudevacharya). Though the alapana was pleasing, the arohana sanchara at certain levels lost its balance and, adding to the confusion, Shuddha rishabha entered into the picture in the taarasthayi.&#8220;Etijanmamiti&#8221; (Varaali - Thyagaraja) received majestic soft touches both in alapana and sahitya sections. Neraval and swarakalpana were rendered by both artistes alternatively taking cues from each other&#8217;s inspiration.A pronounced creativity would have elevated alapana in Kamboji and the text (&#8220;Rangashayi&#8221; -Thyagaraja) to a greater perceptible degree. Two inspiring tillanas: Sindhubhairavi (Doreswamy Iyengar) and Kaapi (Veene Sheshanna) concluded the concert.
