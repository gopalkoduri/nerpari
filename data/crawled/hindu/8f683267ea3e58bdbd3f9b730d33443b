VThat their violins speak is a gross understatement. The torchbearers of the Lalgudi style of profound discipline on the stage, the violin duo, G.J.R.Krishnan and  Vijayalakshmi, set the right mood to uphold sangita  loftiness with their typical Lalgudi &#8216;izhaippus&#8217; and &#8216;adukku&#8217; phrases sending the listeners to dizzy heights, in their violin duet at the Thyagabrahma aradhana at  Sri Venugopalaswami temple on Sullivan street, Coimbatore.The siblings&#8217; delineation of ragas and interpretation of compositions contained many melodic cogs brimming  with musical intensity.  Their well-structured concert covered different moods. For example their rendition of &#8216;Nenendu Vedakudura&#8217; in Karnataka Behag captured the mood in which the bard of Tiruvaiyaru composed the kirtana. Their opening &#8216;Brovabarama&#8217; in Bahudari with swaras was a delicately defined version. After &#8216;Muddumomu&#8217; (Suryakantam), Krishnan&#8217;s exploration of Madhyamavathi through relaxed glides and imaginative phrases for one of Lalgudi Pancharatna kritis garnished with swaras laid stress on raga bhava.Vijayalakshmi&#8217;s alapana of the emotional contours of Ranjani for &#8216;Durmargachara&#8217; was sketched in telling expression coupled with artistic finesse. Their interpretation of Kharaharapriya for &#8216;Ramaniyeda&#8217; was sublime. &#8216;Sri Rama Paadama&#8217; (Amritavarshini ) was well-executed. &#8216;Bhavanuta&#8217; (Mohanam) was played with dazzling vividness characteristic of the Lalgudi tradition.Arvind (mridangam) and Mohanram (ghatam) provided valuable percussion support to the duo. The pandal reverberated with their thani and was met with a resounding applause.Sriranjani Santhanagopalan has all the ingredients of an accomplished singer in her own right. Well-aligned to sruthi, her performance  revealed a confident delivery of her musical wares equal to that of  experienced vidwans. Blessed with a pliable and sweet saareeram, her opening &#8216;Gurulekha&#8217; with niraval and a battery of sarvalaghu swaras was rendered with gay abandon and it was a prelude to the solid fare that followed. &#8216;Nennarunchara&#8217; (Simhavahini ) and &#8216;Dharini Telusukonti&#8217; (Suddha Saveri) showcased her lively tone and timbre in the higher sthayis. Her embellished and flowery interpretation of Pantuvarali for &#8216;Aparama Bhakti&#8217; and Sankarabharanam for &#8216;Entuku Bethala&#8217; gliding through raga-based prayogas in the upper reaches reflected her full grasp of the forms of the ragas.Swarnalatha&#8217;s strength as an accompanist lay in her pat responses to swara cascades and original touches in alapanas. Praveen Kumar (mridangam) and Suresh (ghatam) proved their mettle suitably as percussionists with relish and in total identity with the vocalist&#8217;s style.
