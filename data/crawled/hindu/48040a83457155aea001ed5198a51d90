VEvery year Delhi's Punjabi Academy organises a Festival of Traditional Music of the Punjab to celebrate the region's rich musical heritage. While one usually hears Dhrupad, Khayal and Thumri bandishes (compositions) in Braj Bhasha, the special feature of this festival is that classical singers sing traditional bandishes that were composed in the Punjabi language, thus imparting a totally different flavour.The Academy organised a two-day festival this past week at the India International Centre. Pandit Yashpal, a worthy representative of the Agra gharana, regaled the audiences at its concluding session. Trained by the Agra stalwart Ustad Vilayat Husain Khan and his son Ustad Yunus Husain Khan, he also imbibed influences from the gayaki of Mallikarjun Mansur, doyen of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana, as also of the one and only Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan of the Kasur-Patiala school. Born in 1937 in Punjab's Gujranwala, Yashpal has over the years established himself as a much-respected musicologist besides being an able singer.The septuagenarian singer began his recital with the beautiful evening raga Shyam Kalyan and sang a self-composed bandish, &#8220;Ya rab kar beda paar, aan padi manjhdhar&#8221;, using the nom de plume of Sagunpiya. It may be recalled that the Agra ustads have a tradition of using such mudras and Yashpal's guru Vilayat Husain Khan composed many bandishes using Pranpiya as his pen-name. The sthai of Yashpal's Shyam Kalyan bandish was more or less in Braj Bhasha, but the antara was in Punjabi. He began with a very short nom-tom alap and developed the raga in his powerful and resonant voice, evoking memories of the Agra gharana singers of yore. These days, one does not get much of a chance to listen to the Agra style because after the sad demise of Sharafat Husain Khan at a relatively young age, the gharana has largely receded into the background. Yashpal brought out the Kalyan features of the raga with skill and left the discerning listeners impressed with his well-formed presentation. His chhoot and gamak taans were delivered with speed and precision.Next, Yashpal took up raga Kedar and competently rendered a Punjabi bandish &#8220;Raihnda ee yaar dil vich&#8221;, rounding off his concert with a scintillating Malkauns &#8220;Aavanda jaavanda rahiyo ve miyan&#8221;. His Malkauns was in fact a tappa-ang khayal with all the tappa embellishments. He was accompanied on the tabla by Ustad Faiyaz Khan who is perhaps the best accompanist for classical vocalists. Bharat Bhushan Goswami, another veteran, accompanied on the sarangi with commendable understanding and skill.JugalbandiThe evening opened with a vocal jugalbandi by brothers Jawaad Ali Khan and Mazhar Ali Khan, grandsons of the great maestro Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. They have over the years established themselves as good singers but this did not seem to be their day. Both lacked coordination as well as concentration and seemed to have a rather casual attitude to their performance. Throwing the time-theory to the winds, they began their recital at 6.40 p.m. with the night raga Bageshri and sang a Punjabi composition &#8220;E kaanoon lavaan vetta&#8221;. They followed it up with another early night raga Kamod and sang &#8220;Raajhankar aayo pyare&#8221;. Jawaad and Mazhar concluded their recital with the evening raga Yaman, singing yet another Punjabi bandish, &#8220;Mukh yaar da saade man bhaavanda&#8221;. They also sang for a few minutes Sufi kalam in Punjabi. It was not a very satisfying performance and one was left wondering what a traditionalist like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan would have said to their complete defiance of the time theory of Hindustani classical music where each raga has to be sung or played at a particular time.
