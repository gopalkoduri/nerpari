VG. SwaminathanIt was a pleasing and inspirational sight &#151;  broad smiles and young faces, full of enthusiasm and vitality. The vocal concert of Anil Narasimha of the U.S. was proof  that age or environment is no bar on learning or performing classical music.Both Anil and his brother Ajay Narasimha (who was on the violin) have trained under Hemminge V. Srivatsan, a direct disciple of Palghat K.V. Narayanaswami. The quality of music therefore came as no surprise. Anil has a mature voice   which is bound to improve with practice.Precious pickAfter some precious pick of kalpnaswaras at "Veda Sastra Purana" in "Ninne Nera Nammi" (Pantuvarali), Anil gave a marginal touch to Bilahari for Swati Thirunal's "Smara Sada Manasa Balagopalam."  His racy swaras in "Anupama Gunamputi" (Atana) sparkled with fervour and nothing more. Once Anil laid the strong  foundation for Todi,  his unswerving approach to singing became evident. The delineation was marked by swirls of slow, soft, subtle and elegant nuances of the major raga, encompassing the manthra, madhyama and tara regions. The kriti "Dasarathi Neerunamu" and the neraval and swaras at "Bhakthi Leni Kavi Jalaveriyulu" were markedly engaging. There  was no uneven distribution or vocal aerobics.Ajay shared the honours in the concert; in fact,  he had an edge over  Anil in alapanas.  Nirmal Narayanan and Anirudh Athreya on the mridangam and kanjira were as  impressive in percussion as in their looks. They played around with enjoyable sheaves of brilliant rhythmic layers during the tani avartanam.Among the post-tani items, except "Marubari" in Khamas and the closing Tiruppavai in Suruti, others were surprisingly undecipherable and colourless &#151;  quite a contrast to the clarity in the rest of the concert.Bottom Template Starts
