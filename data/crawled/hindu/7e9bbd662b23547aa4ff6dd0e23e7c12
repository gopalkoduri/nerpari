VThe  presentation commenced after the screening of a well perceived documentary on Narayana Iyer. The perpetuity of this great tradition is assured, as was evident when watching young Ragini Shankar and Nandini Shankar, great grand daughters of Narayana Iyer teamed up to present a well conceived Patdeep. Following this was a Carnatic presentation of Todi varnam and &#8216;Vallabha Nayaka&#8217; ( Begada) by  granddaughters Indira Ramani (daughter of late T. N. Ramachandran) and Sangeetha Shankar (daughterof N.Rajam). Sangeetha then joined Kala Ramnath another grand daughter, and daughter of Late T. N. Mani who was with M.S.Viswanathan, to present Yaman.Very much like a relay race Kala then teamed with her uncle Pt. Narayan Ganesh (sarod) to present a brief Mishra Kapi. Viji Krishnan Natarajan and Sriram Krishnan(Prof.T.N.Krishnan&#8217;s children) presented a fast paced &#8216;Maru Balga&#8217; with swaras. The penultimate piece of the evening was a Kanada and Bageshri Kanada presentation by Prof T. N. Krishnan and N.Rajam. It was curtains down after the family members came together  on stage to present the immortal &#8216;Raghupathi Raghava Rajaram.&#8217; The unique aspect was that all those who played that day, including the great grand children, had all taken their violin lessons from Narayana Iyer. The accompanists for the evening was Guruvayur Durai (mridangam), Serthalai R. Ananthakrishnan(mridangam), Vishwanath Nakod (tabla), Adithya Kalyanpur (tabla) and Tiruppunithara Radhakrishnan (ghatam). The programme was jointly presented by T. N.
