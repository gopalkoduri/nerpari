VRight from the establishment of the All India Radio preceded by two semi-private broadcasting stations at Mumbai and Kolkata, the most appealing aspect of the state-owned broadcaster has been its hauntingly played signature opening of  various transmissions during the day. One is not sure as to who composed this charmingly conceived signature tune of AIR. According to some old timers, it was the late renowned sarod maestro and the music composer, the late Timir Baran Bhattacharya, the first and the senior most disciple of the late legendry Babu Ustad Alauddin Khan of Maiher. This signature tune is devoid of any particular regional association and has a universal appeal. It is played on an instrument called the sarinda, a precursor of the present day sarangi. This signature tune seems to beckon people from all walks of life to respond to its call and stay tuned to their radio sets.The most fascinating is the early morning&#8217;s opening transmission with the announcer identifying her station and the dates according to the Western and Indian calendars preceded by the lovely signature tune. It follows the tuneful choral singing of the Bankim Chandra Chatoopadhyay&#8217;s immortal song &#8220;Vande Mataram&#8221;. This, in turn, is continued with a brief but a tuneful sehnai recital (the Mangaldhwani) and followed with briefly read morning&#8217;s news in English and regional languages.The morning&#8217;s news follows a good session of hauntingly sung devotional music (solos and in chorus) drawn from different faiths and sects. As such, the morning&#8217;s opening session of Akashvani are by far the most charming session that most listeners like to remain tuned to it.Here are some of the impressive recitals during the last few days.&#8226; Tunefully rendered ghazals by Shanta Saxena, Sarathi Chatterji&#8217;s commendable rendering of khayals in the Sunday morning concert in ragas Komal Rishabh Asavari and in Vasant Mukhari which impressed for his reposeful handling of the lyrical contents and the ragas&#8217; formats. Kailash Chandra Sharma&#8217;s flute recital in raga Brindavan Sarang fell soothingly on the ears.&#8226; Although the singer Mahendra Singh himself seems to be somewhat a fragile and a frugal person, yet, as a singer he is an extraordinary individual. His renderings of thumri and dadra are highly impressive and very much in the style of the great maestros like the late Ustad Barkat Ali Khan and Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. His rendering of a thumri in the morning&#8217;s raga Jogia (&#8216;Aangan boley kaag&#8217;) and the dadra (&#8216;Mohe piya ko milane jaane de&#8217;) were with intense melodic appeal and feelings for the lyrical contents.&#8226; Another renowned thumri-dadra exponent, Ustad Afzal Hussain Jaipurwale regaled with his rendering of thumris in raga Bhairavi (&#8216;Balamwaa turn kya jaano preet&#8217;) and (&#8216;Kaa karun sajani, aaye naa balam&#8217;).&#8226; The late Ustad Ahmed Raza was mainly a sarangi exponent employed as such as a staff artiste with AIR, Delhi. In addition, he was also a superb player on the vichitra veena which he learnt from the late Ustad Abdul Aziz Khan who had invented this instrument. Ustad Ahmed Raza was the direct pupil of the Aziz Khan. Ustad Ahmed Raza&#8217;s rendering of the charming raga Rageshwari on the vichitra veena was a rare treat for the lovers of Hindustani classical music.&#8226; Rahul Chatterjee gave an impressive sitar recital in raga Jhinjhoti with reposeful rendition of alap-jod and a mid-tempo composition in the seven beat Rupak taal time cycle. His next rendering in raga Mishar Kafi was a colourful finale.&#8226; Rashid Mustafa belongs to the illustrious lineage of the great tabla maestro, the late Ustad Ahmed Khan &#8216;Thirakwa&#8217; which was in much evidence in his rendering of a solo tabla recital in the fast tempo Teen taal.
