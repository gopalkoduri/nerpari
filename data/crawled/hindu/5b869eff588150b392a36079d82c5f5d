VListening to the Carnatica Brothers is an enjoyable experience. Their &#8216;World Peace and Harmony' concert held under the auspices of The World School of music of U.S. and Carnatic at the Ramar temple in Ram Nagar, Coimbatore, was marked by high decibel music with no sagging of tempo. They began with &#8216;Karunimpa' in Sahana with chittaswarams. It was followed by a brisk rendition of Tyagaraja's Pancharatna kriti, &#8216;Entharo Mahanubhavulu.'Rich in bhavaIn the alapana of Lalitha for the kriti, &#8216;Hiranmayeem' by Sashikiran, there were a few unusual prayogams interpreted with ease. Their portrayal of Saramathi for the kriti, &#8216;Mokshamugalada' with appealing phrases both in the middle and upper octaves was bhava-laden with a synthetic blend of azhutham and kalapramaanam. The rendition of the kriti moved the rasikas with devoutness and musical elegance.&#8216;Varuvano Varam Tharuvano,' &#8216;Bantureethi,' &#8216;Bho Shambho' and &#8216;Maitreem Bhajata' towards the end were delectable presentations.Swaminathan's thrusts in alapanas done with subtle turns and swara repartees on the violin added lustre to the vocalists' efforts.Narayanan scaled new heights with sprightly melkala sollus to enhance his thani appeal.
