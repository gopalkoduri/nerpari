VUnder the joint sponsorship of Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanams and Tarigonda Vengamamba Vangmaya Project, Sahiti Lahari of Vijayawada organised Matrusri Tarigonda Vengamamba Jayanti Mahotsavam at Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram. Guests of honour Yabaluri Lokanadha Sarma, Vedantam Rajagopala Chakravarthy, Ilapuram Vkenkaiah, M.L.C, Malladi Vishnu and Yaddanapudi Sivaramiah spoke paying tributes to Tarigonda Vengamamba, a great devotee of Lord Venkateswara and her immortal works praising the Lord.The function was followed by an engaging vocal vocal concert by talented Kuchipudi sisters Pasumarthi Pavani and Pavitra who received their earlier music and dance training from their grandfather, the celebrated Kuchipudi exponent and former principal of Sidhendra Kala Kshetram at Kuchipudi. Pavani and Pavitra mostly sang devotional sons marking the Jayanthi of Vengamamba. Their voices blended well to present the songs in a stylish and modulated way.The sisters started with a composition of Tulasivanam in NataPranatosmi Devamwith a brief alapana rendered by Pavitra. There was also some attractive swara kalpana by both. The duo next sang Annamacharya&#8217;sEmani Pogadudumein Abheri,Margambudhiin Dharmavathi,Satulara Choodare(Kafi).The only Tyagaraja keertana sung by Pavani and Pavitra wasPrakkala Nilabadiin Kharaharapriya which was preceded by a brief but melodious alapana by Pavani, the elder of the two. The sisters had fine support from B.V. Durgabhavani on violin and Prasad on the mridangam. The concert came to a close with an Annamayya Mangalam in Madhyamavathi.
