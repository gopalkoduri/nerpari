VP. SURYA RAOThe 123rdjayanthiof legendaryvidwanand guru `Gayaka Sarvabhowma' Parupalli Ramakrishniah Pantulu came as a sumptuous musical treat for therasikasin Vijayawada. Scores of Parupalli'ssishya prasishyasgot together under the aegis of Gayakasarvabhowma Sangeeta Parishat and celebrated the event with devotional fervour at Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram. In the inaugural meeting, renowned Vichitra Veena exponent N. Ravikiran was honoured by the Parishat and conferred the title `Sunada Sudhanidhi'. The Vichitra Veena concert that followed was a superb show of artistic maturity and musical command. Ravikiran started withNatakuranji varnamand followed it withBagayenayyainChandrajyothi. The tonal character of Ravikiran's instrument was soothing and theMohanakalyanidelineation was a thing to cherish for long. Ravikiran produced varying and exquisite modulations on the strings while playing the floweryraga. ThekritiwasBhuvaneswariyadecorated with finekalpana swaras.The instrumental support provided by Ampolu Muralikrishna (violin), K. Sadgurucharan (mridangam), P.S. Phalgun (kanjira) and M. Haribabu (Ghatam) was also of high quality and made the concert all the more enjoyable.U.V. Mohanavamsi, a talented vocalist, presented the initial concert on the next day. He was ably accompanied  by Peri Thyagaraju on violin, B.S.V. Prasad (mridangam ) and T. Gowrisankar (morsing). His exposition of the rare four-noteraga Mahatiwas the highlight. His elaboration ofKharaharapriya (Ramanee samanamevaru)also drew applause. The concert of the evening was a melodious vocal recital by S. Chandanabala.She made an impressive start withViriboni varnamand sangGajananayutam (Chakravakam), Tulasi Bilva (Kedaragowla)andNeedasulaanAnnamayya keertanainMalayamarutham. However, the item that was rendered remarkably well was theragam, tanam, pallavi Meenakshi-Ma Madhura Meenakshiset to an intricatelayapattern. The immensely pleasing concert came to a close with aDevaranamam. S. Natarajamurthy and P.S. Phalgun were good on violin and mridangam respectively.Malladi swathi is another talented singer who impressed with her smooth and tuneful voice. Her remarkable items wereNannubrovuinLalitaandMarivereinShanmukhapriya. Fine support for her recital was provided by Peri Thyagaraju and K. Sai Giridhar, on violin and mridangam respectively. The best feature of the day was the  vocal by U.S.-based Mallajosyula Srikant who amply showed his faith in traditional values and purity of diction. HisRamachandra PahiinPoornachandrikaandDurusugainSaveriwere impressively rendered and received a hearty nod. Srikant was supported by wife Pavani (violin), and Parupalli Balasubramanyam of Tirupathi (mridangam).Another attractive concert was the vocal duet by  brothers N.C. Pranav Krishna and N.C. Kousik. The voices of the brothers blended well to present melodiously,ManaviyalakimpainNalinakanti,NeevallainKapiand a fineragamalika. Good support came for them from G. Srinivasamurthy on violin and K.S. Giridhar on mridangam. Young aspirant U.V.S. Bhargav proved his talent by renderingAbhogi varnam, AbhimanamennaduinBegadaand attractiveragamalika.Thebrindaganamof Modumudi Sudhakar's troupe was a welcome change and was applauded deservingly.

Srutiranjani rendered neatly compositions of Jayadeva, Narayanateertha, Annamacharya, Purandara Das, Ramadas, and Kshetrayya, among others. It was a laudable attempt by Sudhakar to prepare and present this kind of a novel item. Instrumental support was provided by Ampolu Muralikrishna (violin), M.L.N. Raju (mridangam), K. Sasidhar (veena), Kumarbabu (flute), K.S. Giridhar (tabla) and Anjaneya Sastri (ghatam).The fitting finale for the five-day musical treat came in the shape of a scholarly violin solo by veteranvidwanAnnavarapu Ramaswamy.
