VGayatri&#8217;s vocal manipulative accuracy and Ranjani&#8217;s laboured expressive method helped the duo live up to their  reputation in uplifting their performance.In their hands, the singing technique became calculative and demonstrative,  and it had a quality of astuteness to ensure success. These aspects were obvious  at their inaugural concert for Sri Krishna Gana Sabha&#8217;s Gokulashtami series.Their  approach focussed on sophistication and addressed itself to the vitality of their music.   However, the exposition lacked contemplative depth, but emphasised the artists&#8217;  competence. Perhaps it was a justification that rasikas have different levels of appreciation and receptivity. Pleasing the audience and pursuit of sublime depth of music seem to the order of the day.In raga alapana, Gayatri depended on the sleight of her voice. It, no doubt, helped elaborating the sancharas in idiom and technique.In the concert, Ranjani elaborated Khamas (&#8216;Brochevarevaruraa&#8217;) and Gayatri chose Vagadeswari (&#8216;Paramaatmudu&#8217;) of Tyagaraja which happened to be the main item. It was in tune with the present day trend which is to showcase  vivadi melas  thought unfit for concerts by the vidwans of an earlier era.  This is one aspect of the argument that artistic evolution does not stop with Thodi, Ananda Bhairavi, Kalyani or Khambodi.In fact, Ranjani-Gayatri sang &#8216;Raju Vedala Joothamurare&#8217; (Thodi) and &#8216;Marivere&#8217; (Ananda Bhairavi) without an alapana. The Khamas vinyasa was presented routinely and impassively. There was a lack of warmth in the arrangement and expression.The profile of Vagadeswari, though  elaborated, failed to indicate the emotional content that the kirtana &#8216;Paramaatmudu&#8217; conveyed.The rendering of kirtanas was slick, duets following  a rehearsed pattern. The choice of songs played a   major role  in making the concert a success. What ideals inspire a musician has a say in a concert being great or just popular.The violin accompaniment by H.N. Bhaskar was on predictable lines.  His Vagadeswari solo session was a fitting reply to that of Gayatri.Arun Prakash, a generally sober mrindagam player, in this programme, swayed between gentleness and  garrulousness &#8212; an understanding that punching sangatis and swaras as sung by the artists deserved the latter treatment. His tani with Madipakkam Murali (ghatam) was tellingly crisp.
