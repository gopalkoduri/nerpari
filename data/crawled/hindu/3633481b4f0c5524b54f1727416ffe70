VSrimad Bhagavad Gita Chanting and BhajansNalini Ramaprasad and group DevotionalCD in MP3 format (Rs. 250).Nalini Ramprasad, a scion of the Alathoor School of Music having been trained by Chingleput Ranganathan, has also had the benefit of guidance from the late Dr. S. Ramanathan, a reputed musician and musicologist.In 1998, she had formed a devotional music group, Sri Matha Samarpanam  with the blessings of Santhananda Swami of Salem Skandashramam. She has produced a CD in the MP3 format comprising the chanting of the 18 chapters of the Bhagavad Gita, interspersed with melodic devotional bhajans. This estimable project of Nalini is a praiseworthy attempt, to reach out to all generations, enable them to learn the verses of the celestial song and add quality to this mundane, earthly existence.The clarity in the sacred incantation of the slokas by Nalini and the melodic, musical expression of the bhajans, do raise the devotee's tryst with bhakti to an elevated plane &#151;  the music coordination is by L. Krishnan and the vocalists are Nalini, Shyamala Krishnan and Usha S. Balaje. Ramyaa Ramesh on the keyboard, Suresh on the tabla, Navin on the flute and Santanam in charge of the rhythm provide sensitive, non-strident orchestral support. Nalini Ramprasad can be contacted at 35, Subramaniam Street, Abhiramapuram.S. P.Bottom Template Starts
