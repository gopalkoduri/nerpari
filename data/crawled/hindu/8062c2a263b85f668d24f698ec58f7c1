VIt is gratifying  to listen to a good instrumental concert by senior flautist  N. Ramani , whose concert held in 2007, has been brought out as a DVD by Shakthi Extratainment P Ltd.Dr. Ramani has, throughout his career, adhered to classical values.  This album opens with the Khamboji Ata tala varnam &#8216;Sarasijanaba.&#8217;  Three kritis of Tyagaraja follow in quick succession with just the songs being played. &#8216;Teradiyaka&#8217; (Gowlipantu), &#8216;Chinnanadena&#8217; (Kalanidhi) and &#8216;Sujanajeevana&#8217; (Kamas) are the chosen compositions. Ramani&#8217;s rendition of the Navarasa Kannada kriti &#8216;Ninnuvina&#8217; of Tyagaraja  is fast-paced and engaging.&#8216;Marivere&#8217; (Shanmukhapriya) of Patnam Subramania Iyer is played after just a single phrase of the melody. Kamboji is the only raga which has been taken up for vinyasa.  Violinist S.D. Sridhar&#8217;s essay of the raga is passable. Ramani&#8217;s weighty rendering of &#8216;Evarimata&#8217; reflects a good patanthara of the song.  The brief taniavarthanam by R. Ramesh on the mridangam and E. M. Subramanyam on the ghatam are precise and to the point.  &#8216;Chinnanchiru Kiliye&#8217; (Ragamalika- Subramania Bharati), a javali in Kedaragowla (&#8216;Era Tagunatara&#8217;) and the Madhyamavathi kriti of Papanasam Sivan &#8216;Karpagame&#8217; are the closing numbers.Dr. N. Ramani: Shakti bani series; Shakthi Extratainment P Ltd; Price: Rs. 70.
