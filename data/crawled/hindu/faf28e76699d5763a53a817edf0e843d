VThere was fullness of appeal in the rendition of kirtanas and unfolding of the ragas,  based on a fine balance of gana and naya. The song list was quite attractive &#8212; &#8216;Kanna Tandri Naa Pai&#8217; (Devamanohari) and &#8216;Kaa Vaa Vaa&#8217; (Varali),&#8216;Anupama Gunaambohi&#8217; (Atana) and &#8216;Ninne Nammithi&#8217; (Simhendra madhyamam). The patantara was impeccable and interpretation precise. The Lalgudi culture formed the fabric of her kutcheri.Atana and Simhendra madhyamam were taken up for raga elaboration. The exposition moved in the direction of the moorchanas of ragas composed with poised restraint. The raga lines were carefully guided.  In swara exercise she displayed well-controlled gentle rhythm.In Hemant (mridangam), Chandrasekharan (ghatam), Shreya Devanath had understanding accompanists sailing well with the youngster,s value-based recital.SVK
