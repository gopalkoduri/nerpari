VMalhaarManorama Music, Rs. 100.00We seem to have an obsession for Malhar raga. We have heard it in numerous Malayalam film songs and ghazals. And, always, it has had that distinct association with rain.  However, in this album of Malayalam ghazals by K.S. Chitra and Hariharan, Malha\u000ar remains merely  as an attractive title.Music director Viswajith has preferred to use other ragas  such as Jog, Brindavana Saranga, Yaman Kalyani, and others rather than Malhar.The most important element in ghazals is  poetry. It is the verse that gives life to it, leaving the listener with   memories. None of the 10  songs in &#8216;Malhar&#8217; creates such an impression. This, despite the haunting voice of Hariharan and the dulcet voice  of Chitra.Viswajith has used a clever mix of ragas  such as Bhoop and Jog in the opening number, &#8216;Ghazal maina&#8230;&#8217; by Hariharan. The pick of the songs is the one beginning &#8216;Meghamayi&#8230;&#8217; by Chitra, which is set to Madhuvanthi. All the features of this late afternoon raga, images of the  sky, the clouds,  and a sense of longing are there.K.P.Bottom Template Starts
