VTrue appreciation of Tyagaraja&#8217;s kritis is possible only by understanding their meaning. In the kriti &#8216;Telisi Rama Chintanato&#8217; in raga Purnachandrika, Tyagaraja himself says that while chanting the name of the Lord, one has to do so by understanding the true significance of the Redeemer.Tyagaraja kritis represent the quintessence of the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Ramayana. Tyagaraja was God&#8217;s messenger to convey the spirit of the Vedas concisely in musical form. A dominant theme in Tyagaraja&#8217;s kritis is the purpose of creation and human life. In the great kriti, &#8216;Eti Janmamidi&#8217; in Varali, Tyagaraja says that life is useless unless one has frequent visions of the Lord, and is in communion with him. Similarly in the kirtana &#8216;Namakusumamulache pujinche&#8217; in Sri ragam, Tyagaraja notes that it is a blessed life if one is able to worship the Lord by showering flowers on Him while chanting His holy names.Tyagaraja had total devotion to God and was oblivious of the environment in which he lived. Tyagaraja does not dwell in any particular period in time, but viewed the universe through all time as God&#8217;s creation. For example, in the soul stirring kriti &#8216;Ksheera sagara sayana&#8217; in raga Devagandhari, Tyagaraja simultaneously refers to Gajendra moksha, Draupadi mana samrakshana, and the redemption of Ramadas. Since I have spent a considerable amount of time studying space-time unity in Special Relativity, I can appreciate Tyagaraja&#8217;s grand vision over the entire time scale.Tyagaraja kritis encapsulate the story and message of the Ramayana. Tyagaraja was a great admirer of Adi kavi Valmiki, and even tried to emulate him. In the kriti &#8216;Epaniko janminchitinam&#8217; in raga Asaveri, Tyagaraja says that it is not enough that Valmiki has written the Ramayana; he (Tyagaraja) too has to do his task by expressing his thoughts on Rama.Rama was the most exalted example of human life, and so it was natural that Tyagaraja was a Rama bhakta. I too am a Rama bhakta, and so Tyagaraga kritis have a special appeal to me. By the way he conducted himself, Sri Rama showed us that it is of utmost importance to have respect for, and follow the commands of, one&#8217;s mother, father, and teachers. Just as Rama was a supreme example of an ideal human being, his consort Sita had the finest virtues of womanhood. Tyagaraja often extolled the virtues of Sita. Indeed in the Pantuvarali kriti, &#8216;Vadera daivamu,&#8217; Tyagaraja says, that among the various names by which Lord Rama is known, the one that he (Rama) could be most proud of was the name Sitapathi, the husband of Sita! In the grand kirtana &#8216;Ma Janaki&#8217; in Khambodi, Tyagaraja notes that by virtue of her chastity, Sita could have destroyed Ravana by her indignant look; instead she waited patiently in Ashoka vana to allow Rama to vanquish Ravana and fulfil the purpose of his avatara.As a true bhaktha himself, Thyagaraja had a special regard for the great bhaktas of Maha Vishnu of earlier times &#8212; Narada, Prahlada and Hanuman. Prahlada&#8217;s story is central to any one following Bhakthi marga, and so it was natural for Tyagaraja to compose Prahlada Bhakthi Vijayam. In the kirtana, &#8216;Narada gana lola&#8217; set in Atana, Tyagaraja referes to Maha Vishnu as the Protector of Devotees. There are several references to Hanuman in Tyagaraja kritis while singing the praise of Rama.  My favourite expression of Tyagaraja&#8217;s bhakti is in the soothing Nilambari kriti, &#8216;Ennaga manasuku rani,&#8217; where Tyagaraja asks what the point is in having this body if one is not able to use it to hug Sri Hari?Rama was Tyagaraja&#8217;s ishtadaivatha, but Tyagaraja was a devotee of all Hindu Gods, in particular of both Siva and Vishnu. Tyagaraja considered it a mata beda (blasphemy) to differentiate between Siva and Vishnu. Indeed in the majestic kirtana Evarani in raga Devamrithavarshini, Tyagaraja asks whether Rama is to be described as Siva or Madhava, because the two syllables Ra and Ma that make up the name Rama are taken from the jeeva (soul) of the mantras &#8216;Om namo Narayanaya&#8217; and &#8216;Om namah Sivaya.&#8217;One of the key features of Tyagaraja&#8217;s compositions is that very often an important idea is expressed right at the beginning. The rest of the kriti is an elaboration of this idea with examples. For instance, the grand kirtana &#8216;Manasu Swadhinamaina&#8217; in Sankarabharanam opens with the statement that for one who has control over the mind, where is the need for mantras or tantras? Similarly in another Sankarabharanam composition &#8216;Sundareswaruni Juchi Surula Juda Manasu Vatsuna,&#8217; the opening line states that the Lord Sundareswara (Siva) is so beautiful, that after beholding Him, one cannot have the mind to see any one else. To attain perfection in music, one&#8217;s life has to be enmeshed in it. As an academician, my motto has been &#8216;The pursuit of science is at its best when it is a part of a way of life.&#8217; I had this motto inscribed on the walls of the MATSCIENCE Institute at its creation. I have the greatest admiration for Srinivasa Ramanujan for his single minded devotion to mathematics. If Ramanujan could be described as a man who knew infinity, then Tyagaraja was one who (through music) knew divinity!My father Professor Alladi Ramakrishnan, who passed away in June 2008, was an ardent rasika of Carnatic music. From the time the Madras Music Academy Hall was inaugurated in the early 1960s, he attended every Annual Conference of the Academy with my mother. Thyagaraja kritis were his passion. Because of his sound knowledge of Telugu, he could understand the true meaning of these great kritis and thereby was able to appreciate them at a deeper level. Tyagaraja kritis had a great inuence on his life.This article highlights a few of the observations that he made in his talk, &#8220;The spiritual diction of Tyagaraja&#8221; that was delivered at the Annual Conference of the Music Academy on December 21, 1993. I compiled these observations from his hand written notes, and from a video recording of his talk.With advancing age, the spirituality in Tyagaraja&#8217;s kritis became more and more dominant in my father&#8217;s life. He had a book of Thyagaraja kritis in Telugu, in which he made several notes in the margins. He carried this book with him everywhere, even in his international scienti_c lecture tours. During his last few months, it was this that he was reading constantly. My father was a Rama bhakta, and Tyagaraja kritis provided him spiritual guidance, blissful music, and peace of mind. - Krishnaswami AlladiPassion for TyagarajaMy father Professor Alladi Ramakrishnan, who passed away in June 2008, was an ardent rasika of Carnatic music.
