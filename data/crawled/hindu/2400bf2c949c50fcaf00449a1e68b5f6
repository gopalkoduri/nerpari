VFirst to tee off, with Tyagaraja as his muse, Tiruchi Pradeep Kumar&#8217;s considerable creative prowess was shown to advantage in Thodi (&#8216;Aaragimpave&#8217;) and Kapi (&#8216;Intha Sowkhya&#8217;). This vocalist&#8217;s approach is anything but staid. The niraval-swara segment in Thodi reflected flashes of brilliance.The Kapi alapana was a subtly shaded, read-between-the-lines portrait rather than a black and white join-the-dots grid. Involving much clever play of swaras, the delineation projected inventive imagery offering more food for thought than for the soul. The most rewarding moments came when the artiste opted for a meandering stroll through the raga&#8217;s by-lanes.The violinist, Srilakshmi Venkataramani trod a more conventional path which relied on karvais and familiar phrases. A brisk &#8216;Nenarunchinanu&#8217; (Malavi) featured adventurous episodes in the chittaswaram.Second in line, Amrutha Venkatesh exhibited her talents, in kritis by a wide range of composers excluding Tyagaraja&#8217;s and Tamil compositions, the already &#8216;taken&#8217; themes. The line-up included &#8216;Bhajare Manasa Sri Raghuveeram&#8217; (Gowla, Walajapet Venkatramana Bhagavathar), &#8217;Saketa Nagara&#8217; (Khamas, Mysore Sadasiva Rao), &#8216;Maravagave O Manasa&#8217; (Sama, Patnam Subramania Iyer) and &#8216;Mamava Pattabhi Rama&#8217; (Manirangu, Muthuswami Dikshitar).In what seemed to be a departure from her customary style, the vocalist&#8217;s Bhimplas alapana served as a showcase for her vastly improved speed skills. Lively, charged sancharas wired to the madhya sthayi gandhara and panchama and to the tara sthayi shadja lent a sense of urgency to the here and now approach.Surprisingly for Amrutha, there were few self-forgetful karvais and fewer ruminative nooks. Perhaps an instance of the artiste spreading her wings to explore new horizons. Mysore Vasudevachar&#8217;s &#8216;Bhajare Re Manasa,&#8217; a composition of surpassing beauty, was handled with sensitivity, as were the kalpanaswaras in two speeds.The final player, Master M. Balamuralikrishna managed to get it just right.Striking a perfect balance between the crispness in presentation demanded by the limited duration and the bhava-rich interpretation of compositions from Arunachala Kavi&#8217;s &#8216;Rama Natakam,&#8217; the artiste began by positioning a conventionally last-aired favourite, Sindhu Bhairavi, in the vanguard, with &#8216;Ramanai ---&#8217; (the remaining words swallowed up by a bad, bad mike).The unfailingly popular &#8216;Ramanukku Mannan Mudi&#8217; worked its magic along with kalpanaswaras that pursued melody sans saccharine overtones.The vocalist offered emotive insights into Mukhari in his alapana and in the composition &#8216;Arivaar Yaar Unnai,&#8217; voice and creative impulses opening up to achieve a splendid synergy in the tara sthayi.A solemn &#8216;Yaarendru Raghavanai&#8217; (Yadukulakhambodi) served as an excellent foil for the exuberant &#8216;Kanden Kanden&#8217; (Vasantha) that followed.Srilakshmi&#8217;s sketches of Bhimplas and Mukhari played up the positives of sticking to the straight and narrow.Harinarayanan&#8217;s mridangam accompaniment was marked by youthful zest and a soft sure touch that evoked spontaneous appreciation in his short, time-savvy tani.The only damper was the poor sound system. Compounded by indifferent acoustics scattering sound and generating echo at random points in the hall, the task of deciphering the lyrics of compositions frequently amounted to an exercise in lip reading for the listener.
