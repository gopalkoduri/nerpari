His concert in the company of Thyagaraju on violin and Vidyasagar on mridangam was presented under the aegis of Hyderabad Music Circle at Thyagaraya Ganasabha&#8217;s mini hall.He is presently under the tutelage of noted vocalist Seshachari of the Hyderabad Brothers duo.Anil lives in Philadelphia with his parents and is said to have given many concerts there and visits Hyderabad to continue his learning with Seshachari.
