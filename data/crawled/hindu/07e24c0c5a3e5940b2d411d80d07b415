VShowcasing of mastery in the expression ofManodharma(aalapana, neravuandswaram) and jugglery has almost become the order of the day in the classical music concerts rendered even by stalwarts  for almost all sangeetha sabhas. More often than not, it is out of their over anxiety to be in popular demand, that they adopt such techniques shunning all parameters of aesthetic rendering.In order to let the performer feel the freedom sans any inhibitions to sing or play music for the sake of music and make the other artistes including students of music evolve good relish for sublime music, local musicians decided to organise chamber music once every month.The inaugural recitalfor a select audience was rendered by renowned vocalist B. Arundhathi Sarkar in the Bharatiya Samskruti Bhavan last Sunday. She was accompanied elegantly on violin by M. Srinivasa Narasimha Murty and on mridangam by Vankayala Venkata Ramana Murty.Starting with theAtathala varnaminSriragam, she renderedPanchamathanga(Malahari) withswaram, Nanugannathalli(Sindhukannada),Sabhapathiof Gopalakrishna Bharathi (Abhogi) withAalapanaandswaram, Etijanmamidi(Varali) similarly, a rarely heard composition of Dikshitar (Udaya Ravichandrika) before she eruditely and expansively elaboratedSankaracharyamof Subbarama Dikshitar (Sankarabharanam).  Narasimha Murty in particular in his turns on violin and Ramana, especially in hisThani, exhibited aesthetic artistry and scholarship.A.R.SBottom Template Starts
