VNadavarshini, an  orchestra comprising vocalists, instrumentalists and laya vidwans, sought to bring before the  audience a variety of musical compositions. The ensemble could sustain the interest of those present through its chosen form and content,\u000a with some eye-catching background visuals and state-of-the-art lighting. The grounding respectfully was on core Carnatic values.The age group of the performers was between 10 and 67, thereby blending experience with emerging youth power. As many as 31 musicians decorated the stage &#8212; 12 violinists, three tabla artists, nine vocalists and one each on the ghatam, mridangam, morsing, ganjira, organ, drums and the flute. Their layered seating was as orderly as it was tasteful.The concert began with &#8216;Omkara Nadham&#8217; and &#8216;Sriman Narayana&#8217; (Annamayya), for which the Deity of Thirumala was the backdrop. This was followed by &#8216;Mathe Malayathvajan&#8217; (Muthiah Bhagavathar-Khamas) in which the built-in swaras were distributed among the performers to present the orchestra-feel in full measure. This finely coordinated musical extravaganza included the Ragamalika &#8216;Sri Chakraraja Simhasaneswari&#8217;, &#8216;Alai Payudhe&#8217;, a Meera bhajan, and a thillana. It concluded with &#8216;Vande Mataram&#8217; and &#8216;Raghupathi Raghava Rajaram&#8217;.A special number in Karnaranjani (by T.S. Krishnamurthy) and another in Mayamalavagowla (by Anantha Krishna Sharma), that had elements of fusion, were creative ventures that showcased the composing abilities of the vidwans. The entire show, perhaps the first of its kind in Chennai, was conceptualised and designed by T.S. Krishnamurthy, a leading violinist, with Anoor Anantha Krishna Sharma, a seasoned mridanga vidwan.Each artist on stage was a picture of self-assurance in terms of diction and impeccable rendering, and this reflected the effort put in by these two vidwans in ensuring the success of Nadavarshini. The sruti alignment of the stringed, wind, percussion and electronic instruments was perfect and the sound-mixing was done with a keen sense of proportion and was handled with required professional expertise.One, however, longed for alapana sketches and lively swara exchanges as these have a high potential for imagination, especially among the youth. A serene lamp would have been more appropriate for &#8216;Raghupathi Raghava Rajaram&#8217; rather than the  inept dancing of circling lights.This programme organised by Ozonegroup,  was held at the Mutha Venkatasubba Rao Concert Hall in Chetpet.
