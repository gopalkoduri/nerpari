VT.M. Krishna, an acclaimed singer\u000apresented his concert under\u000athe joint auspices of Mysore\u000aChowdiah Trust, S.P.V.G.M.C.\u000aTrust and the University of Mysore\u000ain Mysore recently.Shri Shivaratri Deshikendra Swamiji\u000agraced the function organised in\u000amemory of Mysore Chowdiah, a legendary\u000afigure in the field of Carnatic\u000amusic. The Trust honoured the veteran\u000aT.N. Krishnan by bestowing on\u000ahim the title, Gayaka Shikhamani.\u000aT.M. Krishna's extempore started\u000aunfurling from Veena Kuppayyar's\u000avarna, "Intachalamu Chesithe" (Begade)\u000ain perfect tune with the\u000ashruthi, taala and laya. He added a\u000afew passages of brisk and sprightly\u000akalpana swaras too.An overview of the concert led to\u000aobservations of varied nature,\u000aspread over three examples, with\u000aone common feature: interesting\u000athan absorbing and scholarly than\u000adisarming. In Dikshithar's "Sheshachala\u000aNayakam" (Varali) the selected\u000atempo suited well with the\u000aconstruction of the composition in\u000ageneral, and diction and the accents\u000aappreciably expressed the import of\u000athe text.However, while he was expanding\u000athe charana at "Aravindapatra Nayanam",\u000aone earnestly wished the\u000amovements to have matched the\u000abeauty of the lotus petals, the simile\u000athe composer tastefully employed\u000awhile describing the bewitching and\u000alustrous eyes of the Lord. Sanskrit\u000awords were muddled up with the\u000asurging articulations, more rhythmic\u000athan musical.Though, the present style exhibited\u000athe artiste's musical capabilities,\u000ait did not support his approach\u000ato the lyrics and significance of its\u000aexpansion. In contrast, his involvement\u000aand the method of employing\u000athe gamakas, maintaining a continuous\u000aflow of lilting melody, yielded\u000aremarkable results in Dikshitar's\u000a"Amba Nilayatakshi" (Nilambari).\u000aThe soft ascents and descents over\u000athe scale anchored firmly to the\u000ashruthi, and majestic recital of the\u000alyrics, received apt support from\u000aboth the violinist and the percussionists,\u000awho exercised care and diligence\u000awhile playing their\u000ainstruments."Ninnuvinaga Mari" of Shyama\u000aShastri in Purvikalyani reached attractive\u000aclimaxes in all the sections:\u000aalapana (done with composure and\u000amethod), the krithi proper (emotively\u000asung), neraval at "Parama\u000aLobhulanu Pogadi Pogadi" (meaningful\u000aexpatiation), swarakalpana\u000a(sprightly) and a tani avartana. Venkataram\u000a(violin), Tiruchi Shankarayya\u000a(mridanga), Amruth\u000a(khanjira) and Rajashekhar (morsing)\u000aaccompanied the singer.
