VTHERE HAS always been a freshness about a vocal recital by K. Omanakutty because of her ability to select the best compositions byvaaggeyakarasof the past and those by the composers of modern times, and to mesh them appropriately  during her concerts. She chooses  ragas that are easy on the rasikas and renders kritis in the medium tempo in order to keep it  on an even keel all through the concert.Omanakutty's recent recital at Gangothri Mandapam in Kochi, held in connection with the second anniversary of Avishkar (Kottaram Sankunni Nair Smaraka Kala Kendram), was smooth sailing.Catchy renditionDespite a belated start, the vocalist enthralled the listeners with a catchy `Bhajaamahe' (composed by Thulaseevanam) in `Hamsadhwani' (Aadi), redolent with the flourish with which she usually begins her concert. The depiction of Kanada was elegant and the stately patterns of swaras attached to `Maamava Sadaa' in Roopakam must have been beneficial to several upcoming vocalists and instrumentalists under going training at Avishkar. `Murukaa Murukaa' in Saveri (Chappu) by Periya Swamy Tooran and `Himagiri Thanaye' in Sudha-Dhanyasi by Muthayya Bhagavathar led to the lucid description of Poorvi Kalyani. `Santhana Gopala Moorthim' by Narayanan Kutty Menon, composed on Lord Poornathrayeesa, moved the listeners.. Then came a racy `Bhogindrasaayinam' (composed by Swati Tirunal), drawing inspiration from `Sreerangasaayinam' by Maargadarshi Seshayyangar, a composer of the pre-Trinity era. Attukal Balasubramanian showed good anticipation on the violin. Cherthala Jayadevan (mridangam) and Chenganassery Krishnakumar with ghatom supplied suitable percussion.JAYARAMAN VBottom Template Starts
