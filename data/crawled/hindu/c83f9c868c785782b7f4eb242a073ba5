VDespite the popular belief that that more or less all Bengalis sing &#8211; especially women &#8211; it is intriguing that none, except Malabika Kanan and Meera Banerjee, entered the arena of Khayal singing while Maharashtra dominated the national scene. The post-independence scene had been as bleak till the advent of Sangeet Research Academy.Vijay Kichlu, the founder director, focused only on Khayal  and chiselled Subhra Guha and Kaushiki Chakrabarty. While Kaushiki, groomed under her father Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty&#8217;s wings, is perhaps one of the most sought after vocalists of this generation, Subhra enjoyed Kichlu&#8217;s undivided attention and like her mentor, turned out to be an excellent guru as well.That their success story has inspired many was apparent last season. Every year the &#8216;season&#8217; dawns with Poila Boishakh, the first day of Bengali New Year, and gathers momentum with Guru Purnima, Malhar Utsav, etc., to peak during winters and bids adieu with the colours of Holi. It was heartening to find several brilliant women khayal singers this time.Two students of Shubhra Guha &#8211; Sabina Mumtaz Islam and Sanjukta Biswa, both, blessed with rich soulful voices, have imbibed the characteristics of Agra school and absorbed the finer nuances of thumri as well. Their impressive solo renditions revealed that while Sabina is more into sparkling virtuosity, Sanjukta is soothingly emotive. This became more apparent when both featured together during a mammoth &#8216;Jugalbandi Festival&#8217; organised by Indo Occidental Symbiosis in February 2009.Young Moumita Mitra&#8217;s khayal and thumri renditions during Madhyami&#8217;s Guru Purnima celebrations and at the revered stage of Satyananda Devayatan during Sreethakur&#8217;s birth anniversary in March this year were very reassuring. This is probably because she was initially trained by none else but Pandit A. Kanan and later continued with his disciple Anjan Mazumdar.Her delicate, mellifluous voice is like the caress of cool breeze. She uses it to the optimum while improvising in true Indore style, revealing an impressive melodic thought process. The cascading taans with well-modulated grains of varied weight and glide during slow and faster tempo flow with such disarming ease that the intrinsic charm of the voice does not change even a bit. No wonder she got rave reviews wherever she performed. A successful trip to Pakistan last year has encouraged her immensely.The exceptional musical talent of innumerable girls takes the back seat when family gets the first priority. But some, like Nandini Chakraborty, are able to handle both with &#233;lan. Her raging passion for music made her a keen listener, student and performer at a very tender age. She continues to nurture her love with great resilience and diligence. Last season saw her presenting neat khayals and lilting thumris from several prestigious platforms like Rajya Sangeet Academy, Swar Ganga and Sankat Mochan in Varanasi.
