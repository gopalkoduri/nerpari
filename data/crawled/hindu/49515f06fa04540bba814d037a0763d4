VLAKSHMI VENKATRAMANWhat struck one in Calcutta Srividya's concert was her sense of confidence. Beginning with this season's favourite song, `Siddhivinayakam' in Mohanakalyani, she rendered the Kannadagowla kriti, `Sogasujoota' well.The somewhat lengthy alapana of Hamsanadam had some attractive prayogams.B. Ananthakrishnan's version on the violin was short and sweet. The popular `Banturitikolu' had niraval at `Ramanama' and Srividya needs to pay better attention to the lyrics. The swaras affixed to it had some attractive patterns. Again the lyrics were the victims in `Bajare Re Manasa' in Karnataka Devagandhari, which followed.Harikhambodi  is not an easy raga  to deal with; even in the past only a few artistes could handle it competently.Srividya seemed to lose her moorings while rendering  the alapana for her RTP in that raga. She did a better job with the tanam at the beginning. The violinist got carried away somewhat in his effort. The pallavi was set to kanda jati triputa tala in kanda nadai.In the ragamalika of the pallavi, Srividya performed the  vinyasa of the line a few times with tala manipulation before singing the swaras in each raga, namely Anandabhairavi, Sahana and Revathi. But while retracing the ragas backwards, she had difficulty in moving from Sahana to Anandabhairavi.Calcutta Mohan on the mridangam handled his supportive role well. After a couple of Tamil songs Srividya concluded the concert with a tillana in Hamsanandi.Bottom Template Starts
