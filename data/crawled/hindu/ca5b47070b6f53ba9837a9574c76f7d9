VA. RAMALINGA SASTRYVenkatesh with sublime spontaneity contributed grandeurSangeetha Kalaasamithi organised a full-fledged layavinyaasam  at Sri Sadgurubrahma Ramadootha Mandiram in Madhuranagar on Sunday last.It started on a pleasant note with vinyaasam in Roopaka talam on mridangam by 10-year-old Kartik. Going far beyond expectations, he  executed varieties of combinations of beat achieving perceptible harmony.The main programme had Manda Krishna Rama Prasad, a prime disciple of renowned mridangam artiste Dandamoodi Raama Mohana Rao, his daughter-disciple Meher Kalyani , grandson Master D.V.S.N. Tarakaram and morsing by G. Venkatesh. Prasad took up Chaturasrajaathi Triputa talam for treatment in detail in Diguva and Paikaalams. He, with impeccable precision, executed all known classical sets of rhythmic matrices adorned with multifarious hues of Yathi first. Then he  went on shifting from the Chaturasram into Trisra and Khandagathis. Kalyani and Tarakaram proved to be almost his peers executing comparable sets of matrices incorporated with subtle model shifts in their turns. Venkatesh with sublime spontaneity and aesthetic exposition of layabhava contributed grandeur in his turns which he got in cyclic order after Prasad, Kalyani and Tarakaram.While the secretary of the Sabha, noted exponent of laya on mridangam V.V. Ramana Murty introducing the artistes gave a brief account of the important features of the process of layavinyaasam, Prasad started his programme after honouring veteran Maardangika Vankayala Narasimham first on the occasion. President Murty presented mementos to the artistes.Bottom Template Starts
