VUnder the auspices of Amirthavarshini Sangeetha Sabha, T. N. Seshagopalan gave a music concert recently at Veda Bhavan Auditorium, Ranipet, accompanied by Nagai Sriram on the violin and Palghat Suresh on the mridangam. His son T.N.S.Krishna gave vocal support.Gifted with a rich and melodious voice, Seshagopalan began the concert with a varnam in Begada and followed it up with "Gajavadhana" in Sriranjani.Rasikas were enchanted when he rendered "Brovabharama" in Bahudari, with his creative abilities."Kaa Vaa Vaa" in Varali reminded one of the late Madurai Mani Iyer, especially in rendering the swarams. "Mahalakshmi" in Sankarabharanam and "Alai Payudhe" in Kanada were rendered with grace and subtlety and with absolute ease.A tillana in Abheri was rendered in inimitable  style and Seshagopalan ended the programme with a Tiruppugazh. The programme was sponsored by M/s. Thirumalai Chemicals Ltd., SIPCOT, Ranipet.Joint secretary S. Govindarajan (grandson of late Kaveripakkam Veeraraghavachariar) introduced the artistes and C.S.V. Jayaraghavan (Ragu), secretary, proposed a vote of thanks.AMUTHAN RAMASWAMIBottom Template Starts
