VIt is possible to analyse a raga, define and decode, offer a theoretical description and deconstruct it too. Yet there remains something indefinable about it, something that can only be felt. It is such a feeling that the absence of the sarod legend Ustad Ali Akbar Khan has created in the world of Hindustani music.He lived far away, in San\u000aFrancisco, breathing music\u000aand teaching sarod at the Ali\u000aAkbar College of Music. Pandit\u000aRajeev Taranath visited\u000ahis guru a month ago. Laden\u000awith feeling, he shared fresh\u000amemories of precious hours\u000aspent with Khan saheb, moments\u000athat he would cherish\u000athe rest of his life.When the shishya wept\u000awith his head resting on the\u000aguru's knee and kissed his\u000afeet, came the parting statement,\u000a"You too are my son".\u000aIn spite of his insistence that\u000aRajeev play at the college during\u000athat visit, it had to be put\u000aoff to November. Pandit Taranath\u000awill be going there in\u000aNovember, but to the abode\u000awhich only carries the memories\u000aof his guru.True teacherKhan saheb had lost his\u000amobility and looked fragile\u000aand diminutive in form. But\u000aonce lifted up the stairs in an\u000aelectric chair fixed to the banister\u000aand shifted into his\u000aclassroom and put before the\u000amike, his teaching session\u000awould begin in all gusto and\u000ago on for hours. And at the\u000aend of it all, he would look\u000amore shrunk. For some time\u000ain the recent past, unable to\u000ahandle the sarod, he had resorted\u000ato teaching through\u000athe vocal medium and would\u000arepeatedly hone his students'\u000aoutput till he was satisfied.He started the Ali Akbar\u000aCollege in 1955 at Calcutta\u000awhere sitar, surbahar and sarod\u000amusic were taught by\u000astalwarts like Nikhil Bannerjee,\u000aAshok Roy, Indira Choudhari,\u000aBahaddur Khan and his\u000aown sister Annapoorna Devi.He journeyed away from\u000athis premier institute in 1965\u000asince he felt he did not get the\u000asupport he deserved. He continued\u000ato teach and perform\u000aregularly in India for another\u000adecade, after which a similar\u000aengagement occupied him\u000aoverseas for the rest of his\u000alife.Comparing his teaching experience\u000ain India and abroad,\u000aPandit Taranath feels that he\u000ataught probably much more\u000athere in terms of the number\u000aof ragas, but what he expected\u000afrom students there differed.\u000aHe was satisfied with the correct\u000aplaying as per notation\u000abut here in India, he sought a\u000amore profound understanding.The Maihar gharana did\u000anot discriminate when it\u000acame to teaching. There was\u000aan open mode of teaching\u000athat believed - the more you\u000ateach, the better you learn -\u000aunlike other gharanas, which\u000achose to remain private and\u000aclosed-in.Ustad Allauddin Khan, the\u000apioneer, did not belong to a\u000afamily of professional musicians\u000aas such and his passion\u000afor music-learning took him\u000ato various places and gurus.\u000aLater it was under the compulsion\u000aof the Raja of Maihar\u000athat he settled down to teach\u000athere.His struggle shaped his being\u000aand he understood the\u000arelevance of teaching music\u000athrough this quest and indulged\u000ain it wholeheartedly.\u000aBut for his son and daughter,\u000ahis student community was\u000apredominantly non-Muslim.\u000aRavi Shankar, Nikhil\u000aBannerjee, Panna Lal Ghosh,\u000aV.G. Jog and others. Khan saheb\u000atook this tradition onward,\u000awith the same love and\u000arigour.Major re-engineering of\u000athe sarod is said to have taken\u000aplace in the 1930s. The sophisticated\u000aform it has assumed\u000atoday is credited to\u000aAllauddin Khan and his\u000abrother Ayet Ali Khan. Khan\u000asaheb played the sarod designed\u000aby his father and crafted\u000aby his uncle, a gift he\u000areceived at 16, and which remained\u000ahis companion for 70\u000ayears. Playing on it was worship\u000ato him.The uniqueness of the sarod\u000astems from the fact that it\u000auses animal skin to cover the\u000achamber-resonator. It is possible\u000ato perceive this feature\u000aas a liberation from the dead\u000aclarity that a wood or metal\u000acover would generate.Certain meends unique to\u000athe sarod, the ghasit, which\u000alends a rare beauty to the sarod\u000aidiom, the Maihar gharana's\u000arepertory of a variety of\u000agats and the unique bolkaari\u000a- Khan saheb's genius exploited\u000aevery one of these elements,\u000aas also the distinct\u000apercussive features of the restructured\u000asarod to generate\u000amasterly music rich in melody.\u000aDiscontinuity in the melodic\u000aflow was no barrier but a\u000apath to a newer mode of melodic\u000ainterpretation through\u000amultiple timbres, bolkaari\u000aand kaleidoscopic patterns.Inviting notesPandit Taranath delineated\u000aKhan saheb's genius in very\u000asubtle terms: "The distinct\u000acontribution of Khan saheb\u000awas his extreme sensitivity to\u000amelody. He sucked the juice\u000aout of every note and every\u000amovement. When he came\u000aand stayed on a note, quite\u000aoften one felt `That's it'. It\u000awas so delicate and so pure.\u000aHe would stay on a note,\u000amake a home there and invite\u000ayou. Not only the note, not\u000aonly the correctness of the\u000anote, but the different kinds\u000aof tone - everything mattered.\u000aThe note would change\u000atone depending on the raga,\u000awhat people call shruti. The\u000ainstinctive care that he took\u000ain all this - so much of thinking,\u000ameditation and feeling\u000amust have gone into that\u000aachievement - and the note\u000aspoke for itself. I have not\u000acome across anybody else do\u000athis. His concerts were a gift\u000ato the gods."There was a long pause and\u000aTaranath seemed withdrawn.\u000aThen reflecting on the indefinable\u000avoid that Khan saheb's\u000adeparture had created, he\u000asaid "His being somewhere in\u000asome corner of the world was\u000aenough for me. But I lost him.\u000aWhat if one day, Mount Everest\u000asinks? That is what has\u000ahappened. People will play\u000afaster, wear better clothes\u000aand perfumes when they play,\u000abut."
