VIt was a pleasant recital by Chaitra Sairam, a disciple of Bombay Jayashri, at the &#8216;Eppadi Paadinaro' programme, jointly organised by Rasika Ranjana Sabha, Tiruchi, and the Krishna Sweets held at the Sabha FGN Hall recently.Starting with Bahudari (Sadananda Thandavam), Chaitra presented Purvikalyani (&#8216;Enneramum' ) with multiple swaras and vibrant sargams followed by Malayamarutham (&#8216;Karpaga Manohara') and Chakravaham (&#8216;Kaana Kan Kodi Vendum') in an unhurried manner.Chaitra's Ragam, Tanam and Pallavi comprised of multiple ragas and her tillana and tukkadas amazed the audience. The violin accompaniment by Anuthama Murali, disciple of A. Kanyakumari, and V.S. Raghavan on the mridangam were good.Clear renditionDr. Varalakshmai Anandakumar, with Anaiyampatti Venkatasubramanian on the violin and Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar on the mridangam, began her recital with Narayana Tirtha's &#8216;Jaya Jaya Swamin.' She dealt Lathangi (&#8216;Aparadhamulan') with propensity and traversed deep in Sindhubhairavi (&#8216;Karunai Deivame') and Madhyamavati (&#8216;Karpagame'). Her rendition of Kharaharapriya (&#8216;Chakkani Raja') and &#8216;Aparathamulan' (Lathangi) replete with vibrant sargams and fast swaras in an unhurried style was well received by the audience. The accompanists Venkatasubramanian and Sivakumar lent able support.
