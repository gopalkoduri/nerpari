VAnanya is presenting a new series on music programmes, &#8220;Allied Ragas&#8221;.A senior artiste will provide a deeper insight into the gross and subtle differences in grammar as well as tradition attached to the rendering of ragas allied to one or more in a pair or small group.The melodic make-up of each raga will also be highlighted. For young musicians this will enhance their mental perception and grip on the rendering of each raga.For the discerning audience the distinctions and similarities in the melodic modes of each raga, in a bracketed pair or group, can become better discernible and each such raga more quickly identifiable and enjoyable.Some of the allied ragas are: Aarabhi and Devagandhari, Aarabhi and Darbar, Bhairavi and Manji, Bhoopalam, Bhowli and Revagupti, Madhyamavathi and Sreeraagam, Hameerkalyaani and Saaranga, and so on.Inaugural concert will be given by a well-known musician and musicologist Dr.T.S. Sathyavati, accompanied by Nalina Mohan on violin and H.S. Sudhindra on mridanga.This will be held at Ananya Sabhangana on Sunday, May 30, 2010 at 10 a.m.
