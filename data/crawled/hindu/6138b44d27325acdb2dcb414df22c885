VThe Master Recording Company, Sangeetha, that has entered the Guinness Book of World Records by recording  more than 300 audiocassettes of Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna under its banner, has now released six audio CDs &#151;  five comprising Tyagaraja kritis and the sixth Purandaradasa's Devar Namas (Rs. 125 each). The compilation with different accompanying artistes, has been put together from already existing albums.The compositions of Tyagaraja including the Pancharatna kritis have always received exclusive melodic and lyrical expression from the vidwan and the five albums containing some of the Divyanama songs, Kshetra kritis and Utsava Sampradaya Kirtanams that are sublime experiences in Vishranti and Sowkhyam, speak volumes for the outstanding quality of an artiste who has scaled the summit for many long years. The Purandaradasa hymns stand testament to the fact that music targets one's heart chords irrespective of caste, creed or religion.  Two songs in the same raga Poorvikalyani, "Manava Janma" and "Ghatikachaladhi" that are placed consecutively could have been arranged more suitably.S.P.Bottom Template Starts
