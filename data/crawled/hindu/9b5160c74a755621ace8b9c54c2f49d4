VTHE VOCAL recital of Malladi Brothers (Sri ram prasad and Ravi Prasad), under the aegis of Alapana, was marked by Azhutham and Visranthi. Their refined presentation of alapanas with heart-warming musical idioms was a sheer delight to the rasikas. Their judicious selection of kritis was reflective of their homework to embellish the recital with aesthetic niceties. The concert began with "Jalajaksha" in Hamsadhwani set the tone for a lively evening.  Ram Prasad's alapana of Saraswathi for the kriti, "Anuragamule" with not even a fleck of ostentation in the higher octaves lent a touch of radiance. "The raga vinyasam of Kambodhi by the duo in turns with lengthened karvais and asaivus and the rendition of "Evarimaata" followed by neraval and swara passages were replete with aesthetic flashes. M. A. Krishnaswamy gave able support on the violin playing beautiful phrases in Saraswathi and Kambodhi. Raju (mridangam) and Govindaprasad (morsing) enhanced the dignity of the recital in the laya wing.T. K. GANAPATHYBottom Template Starts
