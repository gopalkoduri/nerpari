VAll the secrets of music&#8217;s beauty locked up in ragas and kirtanas wait to be  brought out by the performer, the nature of his voice of course playing a significant role.  If this ought to be the central objective and the summit of aspirations, \u000athe effort by the Carnatica Brothers &#8212; Sasikiran and Ganesh &#8212; for the 50-50 club was noteworthy. Sadhaka and commitment seemed to have ripened if  the way they unhurriedly rendered the kirtanas was an indication. Particularly at the hands of Sasikiran the outward interpretation of the well-selected songs gained an inward orientation.The duo has one great advantage &#8211; Sasikiran&#8217;s booming tone and the facile voice of Ganesh compliment each other to  endow the items  depth and felicity. Though lacking in mobility Sasikiran&#8217;s placement of Purvikalyani  (&#8216;Gnanamosagaradha&#8217;) revealed talent and self-assurance, marked by kutcheri maturity. His endeavour really was not to explore every inch of the raga, but to deploy his resources to telling sancharas. The dense texture of such passages gave weight to the handling. It conveyed a happy blend of sampradaya and creativity.In the alapana of Kedaragowla by Ganesh, &#8216;Saraguna Palimpa,&#8217; there was fluency and effortlessness in negotiating melkala sancharas.  Had he sung them open-throated, instead of shifting the voice, the impact would have been immense.Framing a successful concert calls for big effort in the choice of kirtanas, deciding the  alapana and the  length, the amount of  swaraprastaras  and the  objective that has to serve as motivation. The Carnatica Brothers can be said to have thought on these lines.After the Ata tala Kanada varnam, &#8216;Nera Nammiti,&#8217; the song list anchored first in the Arabhi Pancharatna &#8216;Sadinchane&#8217; followed by the Purvikalyani kirtana, &#8216;Marivere Gati,&#8217; (Anandabhairavi) and &#8216;Vidajaladura&#8217; (Janaranjani).They left out the usual practice of an elaborate Anandabhairavi alapana and an equally over-loaded swaraprathara (somewhat as gilding the lily) to the already sweet chittaswaram composed by Syama Sastri.It spoke of where their musical instincts lay. Such adherence to values provides the building  blocks to their future rise in the field.The experience gained by frequent presence as an accompanist has conferred its reward on Usha Rajagopalan (violin) to bring her artistry close to the style of the Carnatica Brothers with flashes of raga sancharas in her solo sessions peppering the usage of Purvikalyani and Kedaragowla.Kallidaikurichi Sivakumar (mridangam) presented himself as one whose talent is backed by discriminating percussive support while playing for kirtanas. He never lost the focus of the role of laya-intense and rippling in his thani.
