VJAYARAMAN V.When N.P. Ramaswamy performs, his repertoire includes   popular and rare compositions. The vocalist also maintains  the equilibrium and tempo.A descendent of the legendary Palakkad Parameswara Bhagavathar, he is a conscientious teacher, able composer and a perspicacious musicologist, delving deep into  ragas and kritis.Showcasing his scholarshipHis  concert at Sree Venkitesha Mandiram in Thripunithura  showcased his scholarship and   desire to  familiarise listeners with rare ragas and kritis.He began the concert with his own varnam in Vasantha Bhairavi, followed by a sketch of Hamsanaadam with the composition `Jai Jai Ganapathi' by Ganapathi Sachidananda Swamiji of Mysore. `Divakara Thanujam' by Dikshitar in Yadukula Kambhoji preceded a depiction of Saveri.`Thulasi Jagajjanani' (Roopakam), in which Tyagaraja pays homage to Thulasi Devi, was sung with appropriate niraval andkalpana swaras. Naasikabhooshani, though a raga of major status, is not often taken up for a detailed exposition. His treatment of the raga was met with applause.Ramaswamy sang `Kamalambike' by Dikshitar. M. Chandrasekharan, on the violin, accompanied the vocalist melodiously. R. Ramesh, a disciple of Karikudi Mani, on the mridangam and  Rajarajan on the ghatom, provided exemplary percussion.Bottom Template Starts
