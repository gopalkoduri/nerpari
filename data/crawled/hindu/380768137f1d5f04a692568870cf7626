VHARISH BALFollowing a strictpatantharainherited from her guru R.K. Srikantan makes M.S. Sheela's concerts special. She does not fail with the creative aspects as well.Her concert for Poornathrayeesa Sangeeta Sabha  was a success because of the perfect balance she attained in her rendition of kritis,  exposition of ragas and singing ofswaras.  She started with the Nattakurinji raga varnam `Chalamela.' `Sobillu saptaswara' was presented with neraval on `dharahrutsamathulalo,' and it was embellished with spontaneousswaras.In keeping with the occasion of Krishna Jayanti, the vocalist sang Tyagaraja's composition `Ganamoorthe' in the raga with the same name. A briga oriented raga expansion of Kharaharapriya from the vocalist was followed by a morelakshya-based approach by Swaminathan. He focussed on the key phrases, giving some melodious movements revolving around the upper rishabham and nishadam.The vocalist excelled in the neraval for `Palukku palukku laghuthene.' Although one or two syllables of the lyrics were not clear at certain points, she rendered some rapid notes.  A vibrant raga Kadanakuthoohalam, which often embellishes the middle part of a concert, was presented vibrantly through the kriti `Neekeladaya raghuramachandra' with its brilliant chittaswaram.Charming modulationsSheela's  full throated singing gave way to  some charming modulations in her Mohanam exposition.  `Nannupalimpa,' a chowka kala kriti, was rendered to perfection and hermanodharma swaraswas perfect.  Vaidyanathan was on the mridangam and  Kottayam Unnikrishnan on the  ghatom.Bottom Template Starts
