VV. Vamshidhar couldn't, perhaps, have escaped music. His great grandfather M. Venkatesha Iyengar was the Asthana Vidwan at the Mysore palace, grandfather V. Desikachar was a well-known flautist and his grand uncle V. Doreswamy Iyengar was a name synonymous with the Mysore veena tradition.No wonder then that Vamshidhar took to playing flute when he was barely three. His grandfather Desikachar was, of course, his first guru and the duo went on to give several performances together. After the passing away of the flute maestro, Vamshidhar began learning the finer nuances of music from Vidwan D. Balakrishna, son and disciple of Doreswamy Iyengar. They have together been giving veena-venu performances both in Karnataka and outside the State. Vamshidhar has won the first prize in the annual All India Radio music competition in the year 2003 and Ananya Prathibha Puraskara by Malleswaram Sangeetha Sabha.Vamshidhar is now releasing his first CD at Mysore tomorrow at Veene Sheshanna Bhavan. The programme will be held under the aegis of Sushira, V. Desikachar's Academy of Music, as part of the music trust's sixth anniversary celebrations. Accompanied by Nalina Mohan on the violin, T.A.S. Mani on the mridanga, G.S. Ramanujam on the ghata and V.S. Ramesh on the morsing, the CD features six compositions. On the following three days (August 13, 14 and 15), there will be concerts by Vamanan Namboodri (vocal), A.S. Padma (veena) and Kalavathy Avadooth (vocal).The CD will be released at Veene Sheshanna Bhavan, Adichuncinagiri Road, Kuvempunagar, at 5.30 p.m. by senior veena artiste R. Visveswaran. It will be followed by Vamshidhar's concert. For details on the CD, email flutevamshi@yahoo.co.in.Bottom Template Starts
