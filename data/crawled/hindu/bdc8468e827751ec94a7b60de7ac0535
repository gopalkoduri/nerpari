VT. K. GANAPATHYGood homework and a penchant for virtuosity help an artiste to bring out the essence of aesthetic refinement and quality of communication in a concert. A variety of aesthetic twists contributing to the sukham aspect of music characterised the vocal recital of Unnikrishnan featured in the monthly concert sponsored by Sree Krishna Sweets in the programme, `Eppadi Paadinaro' at the Ramar temple.Unnikrishnan's cutcheri was scholarly with perfect alignment to sruti throughout and with no sag in the fluent flow of his vocal oscillations. His resonant start of ``Inta Modi'' varnam followed by "Varalenduku" in Gurujari established an instant rapport with the audience-friendly rasikas. His nonchalant delineation of the raga, Varali for the song, "Karunai Elakante" and for the kriti, "Guruvayurappane Appan" stressing the essential moorchanas with chiselled phrases and appropriate brighas and gamakas to highlight their beauteous aspects showed his commendable depth.Bewitching portrayalHis bewitching portrayal of Khambodi from the base to the crescendo rising to great heights in phases brought out its glorious shades in the madhyama and tara sthayis for the kriti, "Thiruvadi Charanam".The neraval and swaras with his nuanced expression were reflective of his creative energy. His rendition of "Sogasujuta Tharama" (Kannadagowlai) and "Srichkraraja" were in the same keyed-up excellence. An ashtapadi, Dasar padam, "Eppadi Paadinaro" and "Alai Paayude" in Kaanada were winners in their own way."Theeradha Vilayattuppillai," a distilled essence of Lord Krishna's childish pranks revealed the vocalist's musical glitter.Varadarajan excelled in his violin accompaniment and his soft lyricism in the solo versions of Varali, Khambodi, Ritigowlai and swara forays won kudos.Prasad's tuneful support on the mridangam heightened the recital's metrical effectiveness.Bottom Template Starts
