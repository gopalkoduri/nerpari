VIn the Skanda Sashti series of Sri Krishna Gana Sabha Carnatica Brothers Sasikiran and Ganesh, packed their programme with Tyagaraja kirtanas. Much need not be said about the level of their presentation. The songs and alapanas were pertinent to bring\u000a about the solidity of kirtanas and swaroopas of ragas. Dedication to Carnatic music mattered most to them.The kirtana list enabled them to achieve their aim &#8212; &#8216;Karuna Elagante&#8217; (Varali), &#8216;Vara Siki Vahana&#8217; (Supradeepam) &#8216;E Vasuda Nee Vanti&#8217; (Sahana), &#8216;Mokshamugalada&#8217; (Saramathy) and &#8216;Vidajaa-Ladura&#8217; (Janaranjani).In the alapana section the method of Ganesh in dealing with Varali and Sahana was fluency and that of Sasikiran&#8217;s Saramathy was built on vocal strength, with short specific phrases forming its content. There was no extravagance of technique to make their recital exceptional but it was sufficiently value-based to make it dignified. It did not  hurt the sensibilities of listeners. With good harmony between them, &#8216;Gajavadana,&#8217; the other kirtana in Thodi was interpreted with proper emphasis on the different shades of the raga  employed in the chittaswaram.V.V. Ravi  (violin), K.R. Ganesh  (mridangam) and Nerkundram Shankar (kanjira)  played a subdued role in their accompaniment.
