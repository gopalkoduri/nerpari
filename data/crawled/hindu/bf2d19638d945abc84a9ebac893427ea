VPantula Rama has an ardent fan following in Chennai and her concerts always have  something distinct and novel to offer.  A senior musician in the audience confessed to not having heard her first song in Nilambari (&#8216;Sringara Lahari&#8217;, Myso\u000are Lingaraja Urs) for years. The sedate alapana for Revagupti (&#8216;Gopalaka Pahimam&#8217;) that followed and an out-of-the-ordinary adventure in Kunthalavarali (&#8216;Bogeendhra Sayeenam&#8217;) &#8212; both compositions of Swati Tirunal &#8212; took the listener to  unexplored territory.Khambodi (&#8216;Maa Jaanaki&#8217;, Tyagaraja) that came close on the heels of Subapanthuvarali (&#8216;Sri Sathyanarayanam&#8217;, Dikshitar) was perhaps an overload but both the raga delineation and niraval had their stately, enchanting elements and the swaraprastharas presented calculative and subtle variations. Two more Tyagaraja kritis, &#8216;Padhavini Sathbakthi&#8217; (Salakabhairavi) and &#8216;Manavyalakinchara&#8217; (Nalinakanthi) were rendered.Prayogas where one phrase moves smoothly   into the next forming an infinite upward spiral,  were interspersed in her alapanas. For those habituated to Rama&#8217;s music, there seems to be a paradigm shift in her  choice of ragas and kritis&#8230; they have begun to take on a meditative edge and tend to emphasise more on mood than anything else.M.S.N.Murthy, who belongs to the same ilk as Rama, who  accompanied on the violin, matched her in all the qualitative aspects. His tidy replies during the swara exchanges enlivened the concert. Ramana Murthy on the mridangam  had a style that was his own and his tani was marked with some winsome rhythmic structures.Sasidhar&#8217;s flute concert that preceded Rama&#8217;s recital, had a characteristic niraval at &#8216;Nadharoopa&#8217; for the Mayamalavagowla kriti &#8216;Deva Deva&#8217; (Swati Tirunal). There were those routine phrases for Kalyani (&#8216;Sundari Nee&#8217;, Tyagaraja) that were imaginatively rendered. Two more songs &#8216;Eppadi Manam&#8217; (Huseni, ArunachalaKavi) and &#8216;Sri Guruguha&#8217; (Devakriya, Dikshitar) quickly followed.A majestic opening phrase for the Thodi signalled an equally majestic &#8216;Gajavadhana&#8217; of Kumara Ettendhra where the chittaswara has as many 14 ganthara usages. The flutist acquitted himself creditably by bringing in enough to mark each one of the prayogas,  without compromising on the grammatical aspects.Pakala Ramadas on the violin gave satisfying alapanas that had many fine dimensions but had to struggle to come into his own during the swara replies. Trivandrum Vaidyanathan on the mridangam while providing subdued laya support, gave a tani that showed him as an adequate accompanist.The two concerts were held on the concluding day of the 33rd annual celebrations organised by the SSI Golden Jubilee Foundation, at Kasturi Srinivasan Hall.
