VThe monthly schedule of Visakha Music Academy featured a vocal recital by Mambalam sisters, R. Vijayalakshmi and R. Chitra, at Kalabharathi in Visakhapatnam last Saturday evening. Excellent support on violin by their other sister R. Hemalatha, Kalla Kuruchi Sivakumar on mridangam and their father K.S. Rangachary on ghatam, all from Chennai, marked the concert.Having started singing in public from the age of 12 and credited with more than 1,500 performances all over the country besides Srilanka and Singapore and `A' grade artistes of AIR and Doordarsan, they started their recital in Kalabharathi as expected on a brisk note.Rendering of a compositionNeranammithiinKanada, Vandeham(Annamayya's inHamsadhwani) withswaramand thenDasaradha TanayaofThyagaraja (Asaveri)seemed to be a warming up session. Then they took upNinne Nammithi (Simhendramadhyamam)for a brief but beautiful elaboration. A similar treatment ofKanugontini (Bilhari)next established an engaging tempo. Then followed an expansive espatiation ofDaachukovalenaofTyagaraja (Todi).Theaalapana, neravuandswarakalpanain the two speeds alternately by the sisters including Hemalatha on violin were scholarly exercises.Hemalatha, with her soulful and aesthetic touch, contributed grandeur. Then after spiritedly rendering the composition of Bhadrachala Rama Das, Ramabhadra Rara inAnanda Bhairavi, they sang adwiraga ragam tanam pallaviinMohanaandVaram(allswarasofHindolamexceptchatusruthi Daivathamin place of thesuddha Daivatham, also called asHindolagaminiorMadhuradhwaniorSaardalaangias per the Sangeetha Prasthaara Saagaram of M.
