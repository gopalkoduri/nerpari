VV.BALASUBRAMANIAN.One amazing quality of Sudha Raghunathan is her concert planning and structuring. And she never fails to draw a full house. She lived up to the reputation performing at the Music Academy for the HCL series.Right from the word `go'  Sudha meant business bringing out the splendour of the Bhairavi raga Ata tala varnam of Pachimaram Adhiyapayya. The chittaswaras, so intelligently composed by him, ooze with the raga's essence and never is an arithmetical exercise.After doing full justice, as she always does, to ``Thulasidala" (Mayamalavagowla-Rupakam-Tyagaraja) and ``Amba nee Erangayenil" (Atana-Papanasam Sivan-Adi), Sudha's choice was ``Janani Ninnuvina" (Ritigowlai-Misram-Syama Sastri). Her rendition of the chittaswaram, in particular was thrilling.``Bhavayami Raghuramam"(Ragamalika-Rupakam-Swati Tirunal) preceded the main item of the day, " Kalyani," whose resplendence was well brought out with wonderful interpretations.Fantastic coloursThe vakra prayogams reminded one, of her Guru MLV, who was nifty at such researches, both in the raga and kalpana swara segments. She delved into all the possible phrases cleverly varying their pace thus giving them fantastic colours. M.R. Gopinath on the violin with all his experience of concert playing gave a spirited display of his skills in elaborating Kalyani.``Unnai Allal" (Adi, Papanasam Sivan) was a beauty. Sudha's neraval on the chranam phrase " Neeye Meenakshi Kamakshi, Neelayadakshi" was more a meditative effort.The emotionally evocative ``Chinnanchiru Kiliye" was the next to follow. The Sai Bhajan "Man Ki Ankhen Kolo" which is a regular at her concerts took one to the precincts of Shirdi and Prasanthi Nilayam.Sudha concluded her concert with yet another evergreen Ragamalika, Rajaji's " Kurai Ondrum Illai" Neyveli Skandasubramaniam (mridangam) who has earned a reputation for his accompanying skills for krithis, played excellently, embellishing the concert with his interesting arudhis.  He along with A. Raman on the morsing presented the Thani filled with interesting exchanges.Bottom Template Starts
