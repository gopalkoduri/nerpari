VVeena is such a versatile instrument that it can &#8216;sing' in accordance with the musical vision of the performer. Geetha (Ramanathan) Bennet plays the instrument in a style that sounds most of the time more stately than sinuous. But, wait; please don't misconstrue my statement for a negative comment and think that Geetha's music is far from being soft and subtle.Geetha could dramatise her music because she was capable of touching the soft notes in the Dhenuka kriti (&#8216;Teliyaleru Rama') but in the swara section, she switched over to sureness. The Ritigowla raga expansion alternated between strong and supple notes to present a colourful collage and Swati Tirunal's &#8216;Paripalayamam' had a regal touch. The swarakalpana centring on shadjam showcased the splendour of the raga. Then came Bharatiar's &#8216;Oozhi Koothu' (tuned by Bharatiar himself in Mohanam), a song of deluge dance by Goddess Kali , that started like thunder and ended with a touch of romance as Shakti turned sober when she met the eyes of her Lord Shiva. The Navaragamalika varnam in two speeds stressed the speciality of each raga followed by an airy alapana of Malayamarutham and Sivan's composition &#8216;Karpagamanohara' suffixed with enticing swaras.Rare RishabhapriyaThe main slot went to the rare Rishabhapriya; the raga, the pratimadyama version of Charukesi, had a tinge of the blues of Charukesi but was buoyant otherwise. The exclusive feature for the veena, the tanam, was presented as a bouquet of ragas by Geetha with Ahiri, Neelambari, Chetasri (Suddha Dhanyasi with a different nishadam) and Sindhu Bhairavi. The singular and prominent composition of Koteswara Iyer, &#8216;Gana naya desika', and a classically aligned kuraippu swara segment were characterised by their sterling approach.Mannargudi Eswaran and Adambakkam Shankar on the mridangam and the ghatam proved that even with minimum decibels, the tani avartanam can be interestingly perceived. Their combined percussive patterns were quite elevating especially during &#8216;Oozhi Koothu'.Sedate &#8216;Chandram bhaja' in Asaveri (Dikshitar), jingling &#8216;Anaadundanu' in Jingla (Tyagaraja), emotive &#8216;Va Velava' in Sivaranjani (Dr. Ramanathan) and cheerful &#8216;Chinnanchiru kiliye' (Bharati) were the other pieces that Geetha played at the concert held at Dakshinamurthy Auditorium, Mylapore for Raga Tarangini.
