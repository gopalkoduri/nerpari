VGARIMELLA SUBRAMANIAMGeetha Rajasekhar's vocal recital, organised as part of the 31st music fest by Muthamizh Peravai, was on the whole quite enjoyable, although one did feel at times that she somewhat lost her way while developing a composition.Geetha Rajasekhar, who was conferred `Isai Chelvam,' sang the first three kritis, all with ample improvisations, in a brisk tempo and yet with ease and melody. Raga Bahudari is as good a scale as some of the best we know to commence proceedings and composer Tulasivanam's `Bhajamanasa Vigneswaram Anisam,' in Adi talam was a good  choice. Rajasekher's niraval for Swati Tirunal's Mayamalavagowla song `Devadeva Kalayamite' and the kalpanaswara were convincing.  Tyagaraja's `Bhuvinidasudani' (Sriranjani) was given a particular flavour as the artiste built up the ornamentation gradually through the ascending notes before she finally touched base.Against this backdrop, the next alapana in Saveri noticeably lacked in rigour although some balance was restored in the kriti `Muruga Muruga Endral.'  Papanasam Sivan's `Idadu Padam Thooki Aadum,' concluded the first part of the concert.Geetha Rajasekhar's essay of Kalyani was engaging enough, despite some dull patches. The kalpanaswara following the song `Etavunara'  sounded more or less as in chouka kalam.  Noteworthy among the light melodies that were featured thereafter were `Narahari Vesha Narayanane,' in Surya and `Jagajanani Sukhapani Kalyani.'Vittal Ramamurthy's violin support was most notable in the Saveri and Kalyani raga essays. Vellore Ramabhadran always raises expectations and lives up to them with matching consistency  on the mridangam. This evening was no different in that respect. H.Sivaramakrishnan who played the ghatam did not lag behind.Bottom Template Starts
