VBig Music, Rs.150The film&#8217;s music is different from what we usually get in Bollywood films. It starts with &#8220;Dhoop Ke Sikka&#8221; by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi. It contains elements of rock and classical music and reminds of the trio&#\u000a8217;s earlier compositions for serious films like &#8220;Phir Milenge&#8221;. Beautifully rendered by Anusha Mani and Shankar Mahadevan, the song grips you over a period of time.&#8220;Gulon Mein&#8221; pays tribute to the legendary poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz. It is in two versions, one is composed by emerging young composers Justin-Uday and the other one by Sandesh Shandilya. Mohit Chauhan has done a good job in the serene version while KK&#8217;s upbeat version leaves a lasting impact. We seldom get to hear a naat in films. Here is an opportunity as &#8220;Arzoo&#8221;, a soul stirring traditional composition rendered by Kashmiri boy Mehrajuddin.&#8220;Allah Hoo&#8221; and &#8220;Manzaraat&#8221; are weak but Justin-Uday regain form with the folksy &#8220;Chaal Apni&#8221; beautifully rendered by Hrishikesh Kamerkar and Hamsika Iyer. Not a bad bet for those seeking something different.
