VA few years ago, this scribe listened to the melody-soaked performance of the Balasai and Durgaprasad combo on the flute and gottuvadyam and it made a lasting impression. The presentation  at Sarvani Sangeetha Sabha&#8217;s Tyagaraja aradhana was a f\u000aar cry from that. It was aggression that prevailed, the sound system playing a partner.The start of the duo with violin from Raghavendra Rao, Ramesh on the mridangam, E.M. Subramaniam on the ghatam, Anirudh Athreya on ganjira was indeed very promising; &#8216;Nada Thanumanisam&#8217; in Chittaranjani was soft and subtle. Whatever came after this was sheer din.   The mridangam&#8217;s beats were loud and the flute was an assault on the ear.  The  technicians could hardly exhibit any sense of balancing the decibels based on the character of the instrument. As expected here the casualties were the gottuvadyam and the ganjira, both of which were drowned.A brief alapana and a jet-set &#8216;Bantu Reeti&#8217; in Hamsanadam with aggressive swara exchanges between the flute, gottuvadyam and the amplified tone of the violin at &#8216;Ramnama mane&#8217; drew applause but lacked sublimity. &#8216;Sadinchane,&#8217; the Arabi Pancharatnam was a temporary relief and the Purvikalyani alapana was shared by the three, mostly dominated by Balasai. Again there was a roller coaster ride after &#8216;Gnamosaga Rada&#8217; in the form of niraval-swaras at &#8216;Paramatmudu Jeevatmudu.&#8217;Kiravani came as a breath of fresh air. The raga has such superiority that it elicited many a fine phrases from the violin, venu and gottuvadyam in the alapana. Prefixed by a quick set thanam on the flute and the gottuvadyam, &#8216;Kalikiyunde Gada&#8217; could be hardly mauled by anyone and once again fortunately the players set for swaras sans niraval at &#8216;Baguga sriraghu.&#8217;Mastery over the instrument should not end up with the artist showing off his skill by indulging in pyrotechnics.  Also this will encourage  percussionists to unleash noise; and this happened that evening.Kasthurirangan&#8217;s voice sounds pliant and sweet in the middle and upper regions and it takes a different heavy tenor when he touches the lower octave. This at times gives the impression of another voice intervening. Anyway, listening to him is a different experience. Trained by various gurus, Kasthurirangan  tries to integrate them all in the proper style.His concert for Sarvani Sangeetha Sabha  provided a glimpse into some of the compositions of Tyagaraja which are dainty and dear. His main preference of course went for Pantuvarali essay initially followed by &#8216;Aparama bhakti&#8217; with a long stretch of swaras converging on panchamam replete with various jandai-swara combos. Kasturirangan impressed the listener with his swaras on atheetha eduppu in the initial phases at &#8216;Rama bhakti.&#8217; The latter part of his concert accommodated Khambodi in detail for the heavy weight composition &#8216;O Rangasayee&#8217; and niraval-swaras at &#8216;Bhoologa vaikuntam.&#8217;The raga essays of Kasthurirangan certainly exhibit his acumen in structuring them with choicest phrases linking fine akaras to freewheeling karvais. This was evident  in the Pantuvarali essay and later in the Khambodi alapana. Perhaps, one would have expected Kasthurirangan to make a few more forays in the upper region which made a faster landing in the middle and lower segments for conclusion. The admirable facet of the presentation was the vocalist&#8217;s resisting the temptation to go overboard with Khambodi, bordering on the boisterous.  The kalpanaswaras  were compiled on a significant mode with the korvai swaras crisp and on different style.S. Varadarajan on the violin commendably complimented the vocalist in ragas and swaras. Notwithstanding, in total, his support sounded a little lukewarm which was surprising. B. Ganapathiraman and A.S. Krishnan on the percussion front (mridangam and morsing) participated in the proceedings with zeal.Sooryakantham (&#8216;Muddu momu&#8217;) with swara appendage, Atana (&#8216;Anupama gunambuthi&#8217;), Ranjani (&#8216;Durmaraga chara&#8217;), Devamanohari (&#8216;Evarikai&#8217;), Gangeyabhooshani (&#8216;Sariyevvare&#8217;) were nice inclusions apart from the starting pancharatnam &#8216;Endaro Mahanubhavulu&#8217; in Sriragam.
