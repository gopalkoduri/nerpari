VLess well-known and yet\u000aeffectively active in their\u000aown small niches are\u000asome of Europe's cultural\u000alegacies, including (and in\u000aparticular) the traditional\u000aspiritual music which flows\u000asteadily in our Christian circles.The most common manifestation\u000aof such music is the\u000aregular singing of sacred\u000ahymns and carols by the\u000awhole congregation in our\u000achurches and cathedrals, accompanied\u000aby the organ\u000awherever possible. But there\u000aare also earnest choral groups\u000awhich constantly strive to\u000aachieve a high degree of excellence\u000ain singing not only\u000afamiliar verses, but also short\u000aextracts from sophisticated\u000aworks by famous composers,\u000aand other historically representative\u000apieces of sacred\u000amusic dating back to the early\u000aChristian era.Now and then such choirs\u000aget opportunities to perform\u000afor the general public, thanks\u000ato the sustained efforts of\u000asome dedicated institutions\u000aand individuals. Such a rare\u000atreat for many Western-music-\u000alovers in Chennai was a\u000arecent performance of the\u000aHandel Manuel Chorus in the\u000acompact Pitti Tyagaraya Hall.\u000aThe ensemble consisted of 36\u000asingers (21 sopranos/altos\u000aand 15 tenors/bass), accompanied\u000aby guest-pianist Neecia\u000aMajolly from Banglaore;\u000aand they performed with excellent\u000aco-ordination under\u000athe able guidance of Sharada\u000aSchaffter, a pioneer in this\u000afield.Sacred chantsStarting with a Gregorian\u000achant titled `Kyrie: Cunctipotens,'\u000adating back to 800 A.D.,\u000athe chorus traced the progress\u000aof sacred music in the\u000aWest with a string of motets\u000aby medieval composers such\u000aas Palestrina and Vivaldi, and\u000ashort extracts from the works\u000aof famous composers belonging\u000ato the 17th and 18th centuries\u000a(Bach, Beethoven,\u000aBrahms, Handel, Mozart,\u000aMendelssohn) and the 19th\u000aand 20th centuries (Rachmaninoff,\u000aWilliams).The lyrics were in Greek,\u000aLatin and German in the case\u000aof the earlier works (with English\u000atranslations provided in\u000auseful programme notes);\u000aand in other cases the texts\u000awere themselves in English,\u000aeither originally or as standard\u000atranslations. Many\u000amembers of the audience\u000awere habitual church-goers\u000afor whom the music was familiar;\u000ayet a very useful running\u000acommentary was\u000aprovided by Timothy Daniel\u000afor the benefit of other listeners.The concert concluded\u000awith a couple of lively pieces\u000ain the Calypso and American\u000aSpiritual modes, and sandwiched\u000abetween them was\u000athe serene and universally\u000apopular hymn `Abide With\u000aMe.' The last-mentioned item\u000awas set to an enchanting melody\u000acalled `Dorland Mountain,'\u000acomposed by Randall\u000aGiles, the well-known American\u000amusician who lives in\u000aChennai and who has travelled\u000aaround the world teaching\u000aand disseminating\u000aChristian music.The performance, which\u000awas admirable from beginning\u000ato end, was organised for\u000athe benefit of the Zamar Education\u000aTrust (which provides\u000aEnglish-medium education\u000afor less privileged children).\u000aIt was sponsored by Classic\u000aHymns, the producer of a\u000acouple of CDs featuring choral\u000agroups of 150 to 300 singers\u000adrawn from more than a\u000adozen choirs which are active\u000ain Chennai; Chennai Live\u000a104.8 FM radio was also associated\u000awith it.
