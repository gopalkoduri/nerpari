VK. K. GOPALAKRISHNANKrishna is planning to release an audio album based on the notations in `Sangeeta Sambradaya Pradarshini,' of Subbarama Dikshitar.Listening to T.M. Krishna, one of the few popular Carnatic vocalists of the young generation is indeed a treat. His career graph shows he is one of the few young musicians who are earning the top slots in almost all the music festivals the world over.Hailing from a family with hardly any linkage to music, or any other fine arts, he was initiated into the world of music by his mother. " When I was about four, I would watch my mother learning music under Vidwan Seetharama Sharma. To her pleasant surprise my mother noticed that I too learned it! Thus she initiated me to music under the tutelage of Seetharama Sharma himself."As a vocationHis first public concert was in 1988 at the `Spirit of Youth' series of the Music Academy, Chennai, and since then there was no looking back for him."It was in 1992, however, that I decided to take music seriously, as the number of concerts I participated, increased. In 1994, it was while I was doing my second year B.A. degree course in economics that I decided to become a full-time professional musician," says Krishna who goes on to add, " I have no regrets not becoming an economist or management expert which was what I wanted to be before I become a musician."Krishna did a brief stint specialising in Ragam Tanam Pallavi under Chengalpet Ranganathan  and under the late doyen Semmangudi Sreenivasa Iyer for seven years. However, despite being a disciple, Semmangudi's influence hardly shows in his concerts.Listening to Krishna's music is like feeling the rich and rare combination of melody, mellifluousness and mathematics of traditional music.He is traditional to the core and highly innovative within the tradition, creating new and inimitable waves.Golden eraAccording to Krishna, Carnatic music is currently in its golden era. "Compared to the 1970-80 periods, a lot of highly talented youngsters are coming up in the Carnatic music world and there are opportunities available to the talented," he says.Krishna has, along with Vijaya Shiva and Dr Sunder, released the first ever Carnatic music album, `Learning to appreciate Carnatic music,' by HMV in 1998.In 2001, Bombay Jayaree, Sanjay Subramanian and Krishna authored a book on Prof. Sambamoorthy to commemorate his birth centenary, which was published by the Music Academy, Chennai.He is now planning to release an audio album based on the notations laid down in `Sangeeta Sambradaya Pradarshini,' of Subbarama Dikshitar. Collaborating with violinist R.K. Sriram Kumar, this Telugu book, written 150 years ago and published in 1904, is considered the first book on Carnatic music in notation form. "This book tells us how Carnatic music was sung 150 years ago. We hope to give it an audio archive form so that it will be useful for the present as well as future generations."Bottom Template Starts
