VHariharan M.B. and Ashok S. presented a vocal duet under the auspices of Ganagruha Academy of Music and Dance, and Sahakaranagara Sangeetha Sahithya Sabha, last weekend in Bangalore. They were accompanied by M.S. Govindaswamy (violin), T.A.S. Mani (mridanga), and S.N. Narayana Murthy (ghata).The concert commenced with the aditala varna in Abhogi, revealing consistency of style and adherence to tradition.Swathi Tirunal&#8217;s &#8220;Devadeva Kalayami&#8221; in Mayamalavagoula and rupakatala featured a sumptuous neraval as well as kalpana swaras at &#8220;Jatharupa Nibhachela&#8221;, to which the soft melody of the Thyagaraja composition in Shahana, &#8220;Sreerama Sreerama&#8221;, provided a fitting contrast. Dikshithar&#8217;s navagraha krithi in Yadukula Kamboji, &#8220;Divakara Thanujam&#8221;, rendered at an appropriately sedate pace, preceded Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8220;Guruvayoorappa&#8221; in Chakravaka, suffixed with brisk kalpana swaras.The compositions thus far were preceded either by a sloka or a viruttam, extracted from the text of the kriti itself. A conventional raga alapana for at least one of the items would, however, have fulfilled the demands of the concert format and significantly increased the aesthetic and intellectual appeal of the performance as a whole.Thodi was elaborated in a leisurely fashion, interspersed with brigha-laden passages around the dhaivatha and mellow sancharas at the tara shadja. Kumara Ettendra&#8217;s composition &#8220;Gajavadana Sammoditha Veera&#8221; in adi tala was beautifully presented, though no neraval was attempted. The kalpana swaras in the first speed alternating between the two singers and the violinist, and the sudden transition to the second speed without a break, was an interesting and stimulating exercise, augmented by brilliant support from the accompanists.**** Raga-Sangama hosted a vocal recital by G.S. Sandhya Shree, accompanied by B. Raghuram (violin), Anoor Dattatreya Sharma (mridanga), and S.N. Narayana Murthy (ghata), the following day.The artiste came into her own with the succinct, sparkling alapana of Kannada, and the Thyagaraja krithi, &#8220;Ide Bhagyamuga&#8221;, having had some difficulty in achieving a comfortable level of synchronisation with the accompaniments in the initial three items &#8220;Samidayajuda&#8221;, the adi thala varna in Kedaragoula varna, &#8220;Vandeham Jagatvallabham&#8221; in Hamsadhwani and kandachapu thala, and &#8220;Sugunamule&#8221; in Chakravaka set to rupaka thala.Dikshithar&#8217;s &#8220;Annapoorne&#8221; in Sama, was rendered in a slightly faster tempo than usual, but managed to retain the raga bhava.The Panthuvarali suite comprising alapana, Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Shambho Mahadeva&#8221;, neraval and kalpana swaras, enriched the well-planned concert with its classicism and liveliness. The artiste&#8217;s melodious voice, carrying more lilt than power, was ideally suited to the exquisite GNB composition in Amrithabehag, &#8220;Kamalacharane&#8221;.The alapana of Todi was meticulous, and adorned with deft touches, but a few elongated pauses on the pivotal notes would have conveyed the essence of the raga with greater efficacy. The rendering of &#8220;Kaddanuvariki&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in aditala, with its multiple stacked sangathis, was impressive. While the neraval at &#8220;Niddura Niraakarinchi&#8221; was competent, a more comprehensive exploration of technical and melodic possibilities would have enhanced its total impact. The kalpana swaras featured a few cycles of diminishing length at the tara shadja, followed by an absorbing tani avarthana.Outstanding support from the accompanists was one of the highlights of the concert.
