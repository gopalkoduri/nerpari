VA flute duet by B.K.Anantharam and Amit Nadig, accompanied by H.K.Narasimhamurthy (violin), V.S. Rajagopal (mridanga) and Raghavendra Prakash (ghata) was part of the Gokulashtami celebrations at the Sri Venugopala Krishnaswamy Temple, Bangalore.The concert commenced with a two-speed rendition of &#8220;Karunimpa&#8221;, the adi tala varna in Shahana, and progressed with a sedate &#8220;Theratheeyagarada&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in Gaulipanthu raga and adi tala. A sketch of Poornachandrika suffixed with Mysore Vasudevacharya's &#8220;Narayana Namosthuthe&#8221; in rupaka tala and a few kalpana swaras, followed. Bahudhari was then encapsulated in a sweet and succinct alapana, succeeded by Thyagaraja's &#8220;Brova Barama&#8221; bedecked with kalpana swaras.The mellow shades of Abhogi were highlighted in a fairly detailed alapana that incorporated a profusion of sancharas around the tara sthayi rishabha, touching the plain gandhara to great effect.Dikshithar's &#8220;Sree Lakshmivaraham Bhajeham&#8221; was presented with an engaging expansion of the charana sahithya beginning &#8220;Shankara Priyakaram&#8221;, though no kalpana swaras were essayed.&#8220;Ganamurthe&#8221;, the Thyagaraja krithi in Ganamurthy raga and adi tala, which provided a vivid contrast to the previous item, led to a comprehensive and melodious alapana of Shankarabharanam that incorporated rests at crucial points such as the gandhara, panchama, tara sthayi shadja and gandhara.Thyagaraja's &#8220;Swararagasudha&#8221; in adi tala was played in a bracing kalapramana, augmented with fluent kalpana swaras that concluded with a passage of diminishing tala cycles at the gandhara and followed by a tani avarthana. Appropriate improvisational inputs from the seasoned accompanying artistes served to support and enhance the efforts of the lead artistes.***The International Music and Arts Society hosted a vocal recital by Prince Rama Varma, accompanied by S.R. Vinu (violin), B. Harikumar (mridanga) and Giridhar Udupa (ghata) celebrating 35 years and commemorating Founder's Day.&#8220;Viriboni&#8221;, the atta tala varna in Bhairavi, presented here in the first and second speeds with a intervening tisra gathi, set the stage for a concert steeped in tradition laced with individuality. &#8220;Gajavadana Mam Pahi&#8221; an exquisite composition of M.D. Ramanathan, adorned with a spate of kalpana swaras in a plethora of melodic and rhythmic patterns, was followed by the rare Thyagaraja krithi &#8220;Raminchu Varevarura&#8221; set to Suposhini raga.A seamless coalescence of lyrics, music and bhava was manifest in &#8220;Ekadi Manushajanmamu&#8221; set to Revagupthi raga, which the artiste announced as a composition of Pedda Thirumalacharya.Purandaradasa's &#8220;Hodi Nagaarimele Kayya&#8221; in Anandabhairavi was presented with an animated accent on the sahithya, and prefaced the main raga of the evening, Sarasangi.The alapana was deeply meditative, drawing out the tender and plaintive yet mellifluous shades of the scale in a series of spontaneous sancharas that ran the full gamut of the scale, revealing in particular a sonorous clarity of articulation in the mandra sthayi.Swathi Thirunal's &#8220;Jaya Jaya Padmanabha&#8221; in adi thala was followed by kalpana swaras that included a segment of single avarthana cycles in a variety of rhythms that were replicated individually by each of the accomplished accompanists, culminating in a tani avarthana.Among the concluding pieces was a soulful &#8220;Siva Siva Siva Bho&#8221;, Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar's composition in Nadanamakriya.
