VThere were sufficient indications of potential in the solo concert of young violinist Shreya Devanath at the Krishna Gana Sabha. The blueprint of her foundations was quite promising to turn her into a competent artiste. In the two vital aspects of bowing and fingering essential for a violinist, she revealed flexible technique to translate her need into a song or a raga.In her cautious raga essays of Kiravani and Madhyamavati, she showed that she had been well trained to touch the salient morchanas to bring out their swaroopas. In the rendering of songs, patantara was high in scale to give them pleasing presentation. The raga sancharas, though manodharma was minimal, diligently eschewed obesity.The programme included &#8220;Pahi-Maam-Sri-Raja Rajeswari&#8221; (Janaranjani), &#8220;Amba-Vaani&#8221; (Kiravani), &#8220;Anuragamule&#8221; (Saraswati) and &#8220;Rama-Kataa&#8221; (Madhyamavathi).Shreya Devanath was accompanied on the mridangam by R. Hemanth and on the ghatam by Chandrasekhara Sarma. Their adequate support was tailored to the nature of the main artiste&#8217;s play.What makes a Carnatic music recital ecstatic is not the strict observance of text-book precision. Only sensitivity and aesthetics grafted into the exposition can enrich it. For instance, a Nilambari song brimming with emotional classicism can become prosaic, as the Priya Sisters, Haripriya and Shanmukha Priya presented in their kutcheri at the T.T.D. Navarathri series. It had a sampradaya cloak, but was not enthralling garnished.The competence of the sisters was well preserved in the list of songs they rendered &#8211; &#8220;Gana-Nayakam&#8221; (Rudrapriya), &#8220;Karpagambike&#8221; (Bilahari with raga alapana) and &#8220;Ramabirama&#8221; (Dhanyasi). The first half session of the concert flowed evenly with good co-ordination between them. Voice management, talent and steadfastness, if only motivated by higher ideals than just success, would have made their music highly engrossing.The Nilambari kirtana &#8220;Amba-Nilambari&#8221; of Ponniah Pillai that steadied the middle of the concert failed to reflect brilliantly the gracefulness of the raga of the beauty of the kirtana. The song structure was, however, intact.Of the raga alapanas earlier, Bilahari and later Chandrajyothi (Baagaayanayya) were marked by consistency and vocal control. But the moot question was: should Chandrajyothi vinyasa be given such royal treatment of lengthy handling? This aspect suggested poor basics.The recital picked up stature, both in quality and dignity-wise, in the Thodi elaboration followed by the Naravarna piece, &#8220;Kamalambika&#8221;. The parameters of the raga were well explored in swift-paced sancharas with healthy rhythm driven by talent consciousness. Versatility not withstanding, the beauty of the raga demanded elegant embellishments.Not tuned to the wave-length of the Priya Sisters, the violin support by V. V. Srinivasa Rao was comparatively subdued with not many peaks in his solo versions of the ragas. His creativity was greatly restricted.The mridangam accompanist Neyveli Skanda Subramanian brought varied patterns in packing sangatis in the kirtanas. Percussive creativity was carefully guided to suit the specific purpose that each kirtana called for. B.Sri Sundar Kumar (kanjira) had very little role on the dais.
