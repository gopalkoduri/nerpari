V&#8216;Nera nammi&#8217; the Kanada Ata tala varnam, was fixed with a  fast set third kalam in the charanam and chittaswaram, a characteristic approach of  flutists. Purandaradasa&#8217;s &#8216;Jaya jaya nanda&#8217; and the suit of kalpanaswara  was a lengthy affair with several combinations. &#8216;Darini telusukonti,&#8217; the composition of Tyagaraja, once again proved  the artist&#8217;s  control over the bamboo treating the audience to an array of sangatis.The Ramapriya raga alapana and the Tyagaraja composition &#8216;Sandehamu&#8217; were the main attractions once more with a long segment of swarakalpana. Shanthala&#8217;s Ramapriya raga vinyasa was designed at a leisurely pace touching the several faces of the raga&#8217;s native strength; her choice of phrases, especially in the mantrasthayi was supple, soft and caressing to the senses. The tempo was  steady with striking swirls and creative bends.  The swara segment here too was a delectable long spree with multiple matrices of smart swara sets. The concluding numbers were Dikshitar&#8217;s Dvijavanti raga kriti &#8216;Akilnadeswari&#8217; and a vivacious thillana in Khamas.The violinist Pakkala Ramadas responded to Shanthala with perfect comprehension providing impressive replies on the raga exposition and swara passages. But on the whole, the percussion duo &#8212; Ramanamurthy on the mridangam and S.V.Ramani on the ghatam &#8212; were exuberant right from the start. Their presence could be felt in each number through their enjoyably boisterous punctuation on each kriti. Thus it did not come as a surprise when  their thani avartanam sizzled. G Swaminathan
