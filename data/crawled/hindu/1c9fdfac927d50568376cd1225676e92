VCarnatic music is an art form which has produced many seasoned artists who through their assiduous practice, dedication and absolute sincerity have learnt the system of music for the sheer love of the art. Many of them have emerged as performers of c\u000aonsiderable merit. V. Muthusubramaniam is a senior vocalist who has quite a few decades of experience as a concert singer. His voice is marked by azhutham and is capable of negotiating fast paced sancharas and brighas though with a nasal twang.In this album, a live record (Brindavan Audio-9444034268) of his concert at Gana Kala Vidya Nilayam, Goregaon, the vocalist is in the company of seasoned accompanists like M. Chandrasekharan (violin) and Umayalpuram Maali (mridangam). The team spirit is evident from start to finish of the concert.&#8216;Vaatapi Ganapathim&#8217; (Hamsadwani-Muthuswamy Dikshitar ) provides an auspicious start to the proceedings with a bright spate of solfa passages sung for the pallavi.When flourishes are added on to the basic established sangatis in a kriti like &#8216;Vaatapi,&#8217; a certain thought procedure has to be gone through especially by senior performers. During the course of providing a flourish in a sangati at the charanam, &#8216;Mooladhaara Kshetra,&#8217; the Chatsruthi Daivatham makes an appearance which should be eschewed, the note being alien to Hamsadhwani.A pacy rendering of Swati Tirunal&#8217;s &#8216;Deva Deva&#8217; in Mayamalavagowla is a bhava-rich rendition with a satisfying niraval at &#8216;Jatha Roopa&#8217; followed by kalpanaswaras and a kuraippu with a tisra korvai. The kuraippu reply by the violinist is a bit over animated and the sowkhyam aspect remains elusive. The vaara kriti (&#8216;Suryamurthe,&#8217; Sowrashtram, Muthuswamy Dikshitar) is sung with a good and authentic patanthara and is engaging. &#8216;Telisi Rama&#8217; (Purnachandrika-Tygaraja) serves as a filler before the alapana of the first raga is taken up.A brief sketch of Ritigowla is sung by Muthusubramaniam in a pleasing fashion. The violinist&#8217;s raga portrayal of Ritigowla is a mature display brimming with the vital pidis of the raga. Subbaraya Sastri&#8217;s &#8216;Janani Ninnuvina&#8217; is an authoritative vocalisation.The first prati madhyama raga composition sung in this concert is the outstanding creation of Papanasam Sivan in Varali (&#8216;Kaa Vaa Vaa&#8217;). Many past masters of Carnatic music have had a special liking for this composition and have handled this masterpiece giving off their individual hues of manodharma during their presentations of this song. This song rendering falls a bit short of the standard of the compositions sung earlier in this concert. The sahitya and raga bhava do not impress.  Further there are a few sahitya lapses during the singing of the charanam.The Kharaharapriya vinyasa by the vocalist is highly engrossing and accounts for the maximum listening pleasure in this album. The sancharas in the three  sthayis with time tested phrases are very pleasing to listen to. One cannot but notice the influence of Semmangudi during the Kharaharapriya exposition. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Raama Neeyeda&#8217; is the kriti sung.Muthusubramaniam and Chandrasekharan sing and play the niraval, kalpanaswaras and the kuraippu with confidence for the Kharaharapriya number at the charanam.The success of this concert is in no small measure due to the highly anticipatory playing on the mridangam by Maali. He thoroughly understands the individual styles of his partners in the concert and expresses himself with his playing to suit their approaches. Maali never allows the tempo of the concert to sag. His thani avarthanam is lilting without a dull moment.An Appar thevaram &#8216;Vaananai&#8217; in Kiravani is movingly rendered by the singer. The Virutham is sung in ragamalika comprising Kalyani, Bilahari, Mohanakalyani and Khamas. There could have been a better variation in the choice of the two  ragas following Kalyani. The violinist plays Mohanakalyani with gay abandon incorporating snatches of the Muthaiah Bagavathar composition &#8216;Bhuvaneshwariya&#8217; during his raga essay.A kriti composed by the head of the Sringeri Mutt (Saradambam-Khamas) delightfully set to tune by V. Subhramanian is well sung. The concluding fare consists of &#8216;Saravanabhava&#8217; (Shanmukhapriya-Papanasam Sivan), &#8216;Bogindra Sayinam&#8217; (Kuntalavarali-Swati Tirunal ) and &#8216;Jalajabandhu&#8217; (Surutti- Swati Tirunal). This is a weighty kutcheri and worth listening to.
