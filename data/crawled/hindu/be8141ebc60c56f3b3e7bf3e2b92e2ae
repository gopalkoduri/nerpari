VD.K. Pattammal, whom Ariyakudi had called&#8216;Paattukkaka paadupetta amma&#8217;(a lady who had toiled hard for music),  exhorts up-and-coming vocalists to shun the note-book culture during concerts.  However, even  senior musicians are guilty of this unsavoury practice of referring to books or pieces of paper and it was  a welcome deviation when Amrutha Venkatesh from Malleswaram (Bangalore) sang an entire concert without the help of a book or paper.In these days of fast music, it was a rare experience to listen to Carnatic music presented in a conservative and slow style by a fledgling vocalist. Her recital at the Sree Poornathrayeesa Sangeetha Sabha in Thripunithura was evocative of the halcyon days of Brinda-Muktha combination.She has an awesome repertoire and her mentors, Selvanarayana and Charumati Ramachandran, deserve credit for grooming this young vocalist,  who looked capable of transporting the listeners to a blissful plain of &#8216;Naadabrahma.&#8217;Her finesse in projecting the message in a composition in consonance with the score and the tempo was obvious in the presentation of &#8216;Idi Samayamuraa&#8217; in Chaayaa Natta, (an offspring of 34th melam, Vaagadheeswari) in which Tyagaraja reminds the Almighty to intervene and stop the  misdeeds characteristic of Kaliyuga.  She ushered in  a congenial atmosphere by virtue of &#8216;Sarasudaa,&#8217; a popular varnam in Saveri, created by Kothavasal Venkatarama Iyer. Amrutha  followed it up with  &#8216;Sidhivinayakam&#8217; in Chaamaram.Reethigowla is considered to be one of the Upaghana ragas.  It was well utilised by the singer especially in the lower octaves. &#8216;Jananee Ninnuvinaa,&#8217; a composition by Subbaraya Sasthri in Chaappu, found sublime expression through slow strides. &#8216;Neevaada ne Gaana&#8217; in Saranga (Jhampa tala), composed by Tyagaraja, amply reflected Amrutha&#8217;s learning and aesthetic sense.Mohanam was essayed aesthetically.  In no sequence of this raga was she lost, instead she  effortlessly unravelled her graceful, musical discourse.&#8216;Nanu Palimpa&#8217; is believed to have been created by Tyagaraja to compliment his disciple Walajpet Venkitaramana Bhagavathar, when the latter walked a long distance and gifted Tyagaraja  a huge picture of Kothandarama, drawn by him.   The vocalist modulated her voice to  suit the descriptive nature of the kriti. Niraval and swaras were presented in elongated and shortened segments.Abdul Aziz,  Mangatu Jagadeendran,  and Paravur Gopakumar accompanied on the violin, mridangam and  mukharsanghu respectively. The concert was organised in connection with Maruti Sangeetha Sandhya held in memory of V.V.M. Vasudevan Nambuthiripad and Rathnam Thampuran.
