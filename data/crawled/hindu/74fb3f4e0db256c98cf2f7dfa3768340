VA vidwan may be gifted with a deep, strong and firm voice, but how he controls  his exposition is what matters. Some at least get lost in self-exhibitionism. The image of music&#8217;s beauty cannot be presented by dazzling delineation. Speed, madhyamakala, karvais and kalapramana, in proper balance, play a leading role in contributing to excellence. A good and pliant  voice tempts a musician to over reach himself making the performance lopsided with excess of one asp\u000aect and  vocal eloquence normally paralysing  the faculty of moderation.These thoughts arose while listening to the kutcheri of S. Kasturirangan for the Sri Thyagaraja Seva Samiti on the Bahula Panchami day. His effort proclaimed him to be a fully worthy performer.  The training he had received is well founded in music of deep vitality. The way he brought out the grandeur and grace of Sri Tyagaraja&#8217;s songs was praiseworthy.Kasturirangan revealed his consummate  skill in the majestic picturisation of ragas. His bhani, fully reflective of the techniques and idiosyncrasies  of the guru, made for the supremacy of a youngster&#8217;s concert. It must be said to his credit that he has so trained his voice that nothing in expression is beyond its reach.The uniform tonal depth had a sparkle of its own. So the Tyagaraja kirtanas he rendered glowed with aesthetic distinction.In raga alapanas, niravals and songs his expansive manodharma made a rasika think of this youngster&#8217;s concert as exceptional. He willingly surrendered to the fascination of his vocal mobility. Listeners riveted their attention on how well he worked out his musical objective.He rendered alapanas of Kalyani and Thodi, both allowing full scope for his exuberant display. With speed and madhyamakala phrasings there was noticeable change of pace with a clever adjustment of vocal modulation and direction. While there was perceptible vigour in his exposition there was no trace of stridency because of the melodic stimulation naturally grafted in his voice.The song list included &#8216;Evarani&#8217; (Devamritavarshini), &#8216;Amma Raavamma&#8217; (Kalyani) and &#8216;Enduku Dayaraadhura&#8217; (Thodi). Good sense in the choice of the songs made for the success of the concert. While  his music contained all the good points, he has to pay attention to one vital factor. Over-emulation of the guru&#8217;s bhani ought not to inhibit individuality. Absorbing the essentials, he has to build an image of his own.In the matter of style, the vocalist&#8217;s and that of violinist Shertalai R. Sivakumar were  at variance. The latter ploughed his own furrow. Mridangist B. Ganapathi Raman relished Kasturirangan&#8217;s prompting.Bottom Template Starts
