VOne such event was the talk of the town in Kalamazoo, a culturally thriving city in western Michigan, U.S., where it is believed Elvis Presley still lives!Billed as the &#8220;farewell&#8221; concert by mridangist of Indian origin, Rohan Krishnamurthy who, it was announced, is leaving for doctoral studies at the  Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, the event was a jugalbandi between Rohan and four-time Grammy award winning percussionist, Glen Velez.The programme itself lasted slightly more than an hour. The first piece was called &#8220;Coba&#8221; and involved Glen on two frame drums and Rohan on the ganjira.The name Coba refers to an ancient Mexican city. This is normally a frame drum speciality, but at this event both players engaged in a dialogue of intricate patterns and novel use of vocal percussion by Glen over drumming.It was followed by a  captivating solo by Glen on what he called the &#8220;blue tambourine&#8221; and shakers.The shakers comprised a wide variety of instruments with great timbres emanating from simple instruments.Glen&#8217;s solo had an equal response by the mridangist in his &#8220;thani&#8221; set to Misra Chapu, in the traditional format incorporating different nadais.Known for his throat singing, Glen pulled another rabbit from his hat where one could hear two notes at the same time (overtones) with added frame drum for effects. Glen and Rohan provided a combination of effects in the next piece, &#8220;Masmoudi,&#8221; where the ganjira was combined with a variety of drums displaying compositions based on Middle-Eastern rhythms with significant improvisation alternatively by Rohan and Glen Velez.The culminating piece was one Rohan composed called &#8220;Shades of Three.&#8221; In simple terms it was a juglabandi between mridangam and riq (Middle eastern frame drum) in tisra nadai Adi talam.&#8220;Putting together this concert was quite easy,&#8221; Rohan said  &#8220;given the competence of Glen and his own familiarity with South Indian percussion.&#8221; According to Rohan, the concert was part of the regular Indian Classical Concert and Lecture Series that he has been directing for the past four years.The series has featured in the past well known musicians like Guruvayur Dorai (Rohan&#8217;s teacher), Ravikiran, N. Ramani, T.N.Krishnan, Sowmya, Raja Rao as well as U.S. artists such as saxophone player Prasant Radhakrishnan. Academicians such as Dr. David Nelson, Dr. Steve Rush and Dr. Woodson have also appeared for the series.On the whole, the experience was new and worth attending and exhibited the great skills of an already established percussionist and a prodigious young talent.
