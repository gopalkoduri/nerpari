VRamdas presented a harmonium recital at the Nadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha, Mysore, accompanied by H.K. Narasimha Murthy (violin), C. Cheluvaraju (mridanga) and Tumkur B. Ravishankar (ghata). Display of his musical excellence renewed and reaffirmed the c\u000alassical relevance of an instrument which has now become almost obsolete in the field of Carnatic music.More interestingly, the wise and imaginative artiste ideally adhered to the essence of music rather than resorting to any redundant technical feat. Final outcome was a unique presentation of popular compositions, wrapped in a style that combined dexterity, imagination and artistry.Observe compositions like &#8220;Ramabhakti&#8221; (Shudhabangala-Thyagaraja) and &#8220;Enthanine&#8221; (Mukhari-Thyagaraja), presented in the gaayaki style. Apt pace and accentuations, complemented by meaningful (not only musical) nilugades were distinctive features, often missing even in vocal concerts.Fluent expatiations of Mukhari, Shudhabangala, Shahana (&#8220;Vandanamu Raghunandana&#8221; - Thyagaraja) and Bindumalini (&#8220;Entha Mudho&#8221; - Thyagaraja) convincingly reflected his intuitive sense of ragabhava, which never left the audience in any uncertainty in identifying them.Raga-thana-pallavi (&#8220;Dasharathakumara Sitharama&#8221;) in Shyamalangi was mystical rather than being musical. Perhaps, Shanmukhapriya or Simhendramadhyama could have been better choices for a lasting appeal.&#8220;Shri Mahaganapathi&#8221; (Atana - Jayachamaraja Wadiyar), &#8220;Pillangoviya&#8221; (Mohana-Purandaradasa) and &#8220;Shri Chamundeshwari&#8221; (Bilahari-Vasudevacharya) were other inclusions.***As a tribute to M.H. Raja Rao, the noted organiser, Nadabrahma Sangeetha Sabha had conducted a workshop on Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s compositions under the guidance of senior musician, Vidwan T.P. Vaidyanathan.In the valedictory session, around 11 senior participants sang selected compositions of high musical and devotional values. Expressions harmonising with the sentimental core of the lyrics, &#8220;Umaramanan&#8221; (Hindola), &#8220;Devi Neeye&#8221; (Kiravani) and &#8220;Shrinivasa Tiruvenkata&#8221; (Hamsanandi) justified the composer&#8217;s vision and scholarly depth.***R. Ganesh&#8217;s vocal concert followed. H.K. Venkataram (violin), Madipakkam Suresh (mridanga) and G. Guruprasanna (khanjira) accompanied. Soon after a short while from the commencement of the concert by a varna (&#8220;Neranammithinayya&#8221; - Kaanada - Ramnad Srinivasa Iyengar) and &#8220;Shri Mahaganapathiravathu&#8221; (Goula -Dikshithar), the concert gained perceptible momentum. But in the midst of evolving manodharma, the artiste&#8217;s remarkable fluency transformed into a gushing vivacity.Incidentally, some of the lyrical areas suffered. The alapanas mainly reflected the ragas instead of complementing the compositions.Observe, Thyagaraja&#8217;s &#8220;Shambhomahadeva&#8221; (Pantuvaraali), a composition that inheres, inspires and in return expects a delicate rendition warranting utmost delicacy and involvement. A speedy recital and surging bhirkas almost muddled up the Sanskrit lyrics. Even the neraval at the pallavi suffered similarly, though the artiste&#8217;s expertise remained unquestionable as far as his sense of rhythm and quickness in swara-configuration were concerned.Added to this, the percussion support was  not in favour of the composition. Mukthayas resembled the fervour one expected in a tani avarthana.Raga (Saveri) &#8212; Thana &#8211; Pallavi (&#8220;Bhaavayami Raghuramam&#8221;) expanded into raagamaalika (Naatakuranji, Mohana, Mukhari and so on). It was an admirable presentation establishing the artiste&#8217;s thorough control over his voice which modulated in accordance with his manodharma. &#8220;Naradaguruswamy&#8221; (Durbar-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Raara Rajivalochana&#8221; (Mohana -Vasudevacharya) were other highlights.
