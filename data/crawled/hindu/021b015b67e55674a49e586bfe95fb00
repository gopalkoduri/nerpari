VThe concert of T.V. Ramprasadh commenced on a solemn, poignant note. He made a reference to the sad demise of the Sabha Secretary K.S. Venkataraman and as a mark of respect to the departed soul, the artists and the audience stood in silence for a minute.The departure of a good friend might have made Ramprasadh render &#8216;Eti Janmamithiha, O Rama' in Varali and &#8216; Mokshamugalatha' in Saramathi. Both were Bhava laden. If the former brought out a melancholic feel, the latter created a thoughtful mood. The Varali kriti of Saint Tyagaraja had an expansive niraval at &#8216;Sagara Sayanuni,' but no kalpanaswara. May be, the artist wanted the composer's emotion to stay on. In the Saramathi kriti, which he rendered at the concluding portion of the concert, significantly the artist laid stress on the charanam, &#8216;Praana Anala Samyogamuvalla.'The piece-de-resistance was &#8216;Ramabhirama' of the Saint in Dhanyasi. The elaborate alapana brought out the bhakti rasa of the raga. He did not leave a single sangati untouched. V.L. Kumar, the veteran violinist did not lag behind. His exposition too was equally mellifluous. In the kriti, Saint Tyagaraja pleads with Lord Rama to be constantly in a dialogue with him. &#8220;Is there any bliss greater than this?' asks the Saint. The niraval and swaras were at the pallavi itself. The thani by the father-son duo, Prapancham Ravindran (mridangam) and Prapancham Shylendran (ganjira) was of a very high order. If the mridangam was musically thunderous, ganjira was soft as silk. The combination created a lovely rhythmic ambiance. The tisra and misra nadais were scintillating.Earlier, the concert opened with the Abhogi varnam. It was old wine in a new bottle. Yes, the Pallavi was rendered in two kaalaas, with the charanam in tisra and tisra mel nadais. A lot of practice would have gone into it, no doubt. &#8216;Ramachandram Bhavayami' (Vasantha) in Rupakam along with swaras was a neat rendition.His Bilahari alapana brought in nostalgic memories of great masters handling the raga. It was appropriate for a wintry morning. The all time favourite, &#8216;Parithanamichithe' of Patnam Subramania Iyer in Khanda chapu was the chosen piece. The Kathanakuthuhalam piece of Mysore Vasudevachar, &#8216;Ni Keladayaraadhu Ramachandra' was as sweet as it was breezy. It has a lovely chittaswara as well. The concert concluded with the Purandara dasar devaranama, &#8216;Govindaa, Ninna' and a Thiruppugazh.(ramakrishnan.h@gmail.com)
