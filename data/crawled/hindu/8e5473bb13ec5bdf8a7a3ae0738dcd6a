VBanyan Tree Events, a company that has in the past brought to the Capital festivals of music on various themes, now brings Ruhaniyat, a Sufi and Mystic Music Festival this Sunday at the Garden of Five Senses. Says Mahesh Babu, Director of the company, who has conceptualised the festival, "The speciality of Ruhaniyat is that there are no big names. These are people who practice Sufism in their lives. That is why we wanted to expose them to people in the cities too." Though the festival has been an annual event in Mumbai for the last six years, where, says Babu, it draws huge crowds, it is being presented in Delhi for the first time. The line-up includes Jikir Jari by Hafiza Begum and Group from Assam, Sufi Kalam by the Nanak Manak Brothers of Punjab, Zikr-e-Rifayi by fakirs of Hyderabad, Baul songs by Parvathy Baul and group, mystic songs and Sufiana mausiqi by Kalash Mehra Sadhu from Kashmir, Sindhi Seraiki and mystic songs by Kachra Khan, Rana Khan and others from Rajasthan and Sufi Qawwali by the Sabri Brothers of Jaipur.The festival starts at 6 p.m. this Sunday.
