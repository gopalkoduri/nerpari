VLALITHAA KRISHNANSinging under the auspices of the Tirumala Tirupathi Devasthanam at the TTD Information Centre, G. Bhuvaneshwari presented a neat, well-ordered recital. Having been groomed by eminent gurus such as Neyyatinkara Vasudevan and Professor Omanakutty, the artiste based her concert on a judicious mix of compositions highlighted by apt tonal modulation and an unhurried approach.Annamacharya&#8217;s &#8216;Sriman Narayana&#8217; (Bowli) struck a devotional note, while in Tyagaraja\u000a&#8217;s &#8216;Venugana&#8217; the upper reaches of Kedaragowla were negotiated with comfort.A composition of Suvarna Nalapatt, &#8216;Gopala&#8217; (Mayamalavagowla) set a sedate pace. The imposing edifice of the Syama Sastri masterpiece &#8216;Mayamma&#8217; cast its customary spell. One was left wishing that the artiste had opted to delve deeper into the emotive content of this esoteric oeuvre, instead of settling for a pragmatic approach. The patterned formations of the vocalist&#8217;s Mohanam delineation spoke of a planned approach, while in his version, the violinist, V.L.Sudarshan allowed spontaneity to take over.The lyrical appeal of Oothukadu Venkatasubbaiyer&#8217;s &#8216;Swagatham Krishna&#8217; held sway before concise tisra and chatusra gait kalpanaswara sallies surfaced. Another composition of Suvarna Nalapatt, &#8216;Chandramowlini devi&#8217; (Chalanattai) was an off-the-beaten-track offering, followed by Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Venkataramana&#8217; (Lathangi)The artiste&#8217;s competent sketch of Todi, the main raga, touched upon the salient features with practised ease. The Oothukadu krithi &#8216;Thaye Yashoda&#8217; supported niraval at &#8216;Kaalinil Silambu&#8217; and the swaras in two speeds were animated by a lively spark, drawing pat responses from the violinist. Clarity and a natural interlinking of ideas marked V.L. Sudarshan&#8217;s Thodi exposition. Tripunithura A.S, Neelakantan (mridangam) came up with an absorbing tani avartanam laced with emphatic variations.The tukkadas included &#8216;Rama rama&#8217; (Tilang) and &#8216;Uyyala&#8217;(Neelambari) brushed with a soothing touch.Bottom Template Starts
