VB. RAMADEVIThe Pollachi Tamizhisai Sangham chose to celebrate its 35th anniversary and Rajah Sir Muthiah Chettiar's birth centenary with a five-day programme of dance and music at Mahatma Gandhi Mandapam, Pollachi.At the inaugural concert, Dr. Sirkazhi Siva Chidambaram offered great entertainment to the audience by singing popular  Tamil songs to a packed hall.With a heart-warming smile that stayed on his lips throughout, Siva Chidambaram commenced his concert with `Sevikka Vaendumayya' in Andolika by Muthu Thandavar.After a meaningful virutham he presented `Nilladha Selvathai Nilaikka Seydhaan,' a song specially composed on Rajah Sir Muthaiah Chettiar, highlighting his generosity, benevolence and service to the cause of education and Tamil music.He offered musical versions of three Thirukkural couplets on gratitude &#151;   `Ennanri Kondraarkkum Uyvundaam', `Nandri Marappathu nanranru' and `Kaalathinaal Seidha Nandri.' `Thalaiye Nee Vanangu', `Kattai Kadandhaen' (an Arutpa, by Ramalinga Vallalar) and `Saathiyilai Madhangalilai' were some of the lively songs he presented before he began an elaborate alapana of Amrithavarshini.The song `Enai Nee Maravadhe' was a favourite of his illustrious father Sirkazhi Govindarajan.The neraval and swaraprastharas were exercises in sprightliness and the accompanying artists,  Sikkil Bhaskaran (violin), Kudanthai A. Saravanan (mridangam) Thiruvarur G. Sai Krishnan (Kanjira) Madras J. Ramdas (ghatam) and Chidambaram Rajendran (morsing) openly showed their enjoyment in accompanying him.As the vocalist sang a few phrases of swaras, the others took over one by one and as the swaras rose to a crescendo.Siva Chidambaram spread cheer among his co-artistes, encouraging and appreciating them.A group  of tiny tots brought in listeners' requests and he happily obliged them. Some of them were `Eppadi Padinaro', `Chinnanjiru Penn Polae', `Amuthum Thenum Edharku', `Ullathil Nalla Ullam'and `Samarasam Ulaavum Idamae'.One could not help thinking how meaningful the film songs have been.The concert came to an end with a Thiruppugazh, and `Vaazhiya Senthamizh.'Sivachidambaram was awarded the title `Senthamizh Isai Sudar' the following day.Bottom Template Starts
