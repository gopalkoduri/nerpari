VPatnam Subramanya Iyer, a prasishya of Thyagaraja, was a versatile composer who composed a large number of krithis, varnams, javalis and thillanas. His compositions have become very popular among the musicians. Many of his varnams likeNavaragamalika varnam,Jalajakshha(Hamsadhvani),Evaribhodhana(Abhogi),Sarasuda(Saveri) and several other varnams have become part of the initial training in Carnatic Music. His compositions are widely sung in concerts.The Swarajhari Sabha and Sama Gana Lahari Trust of Vijayawada jointly organised the 106th vardanthi of Patnam at Sri Sivaramakrishna Kshetram.
