VG.S. PAULMusic lovers of Thrissur had an exhilarating experience when the caricaturist Jayaraj Warrier took them on a tour of select film songs, last Saturday. `Mazhakkinaavukal' (Monsoon Dreams) conceived and compered by him highlighted the graphic description of the seasons in the lyrics of Malayalam film songs. Twenty-five songs were presented by a group of young artistes  that was held under the aegis of the cultural organisation Bharatam. Quoting profusely from the works of many poets, Jayaraj expatiated on the agony and ecstasy ushered in by the monsoon season. This found expression through `Panineer mazha, poo mazha, then mazha,' a creation of the Vayalar-Devarajan team in the film `Bhoomidevi.' It was rendered quite alluringly by the playback singer Viswanath. Roshini's `Pranayamayi' from `Azhakiya Ravana' followed.At this juncture, Jayaraj pointed out that the rainy month of `Karkitakam' marked also a period of separation. Viswanath's `Innale ente nenchile' (Balettan) conveyed this mood quite alluringly.Onam was portrayed through the song `Manjani poo nilavil' (`Nagarame Nanni').The duet `Manssilunaroo, usha sandhiayaay' (`Marunattil Oru Malayalee') by Naveen Namboodiri and Roshini evoked memories of Navarathry.Jayaraj depicted winter with the help of `Sabari Malayil Thanka Sooryodayam' (`Swamy Ayyappan').' The duet `Mehruba, mehruba' (`Perumazhakkalam') evoked memories of Ramadan that falls in the same season. Notable among the songs selected for the season of winter was `Sisira kaala megham' (`Devaragam'). `Pramadavanam veendum' (`His Highness Abdulla'), one of the captivating creations of the late director Raveendran, announced the arrival of spring. The new comer Srirekha exhibited remarkable maturity while singing `Poovukalkku punnya kaalam' (Chuvanna Sandhyakal).`Thullikkoru thudam pemaari' (Eetta) sung by Viswanath and Roshini was a fitting finale to the musical journey through the cycle of seasons.Sunny Master's orchestra did a good job.Bottom Template Starts
