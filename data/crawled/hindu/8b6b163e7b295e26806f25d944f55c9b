VHer voice seemed to possess the right magical potency that was evident  throughout.The songs themselves (Narasimha Mamava, Swarajati (Rave), Anjaneya and Gnanamo Sagaradha and more) with an emphasis on Swati Tirunal were  of equal worth.The swaraprastharams had an easy flow and followed the Semmangudi style.  Bhama, who provided vocal support, played her role in a pleasing way.Lalgudi Vijayalakshmi&#8217;s (violin) accompanying style during the alapanas and swara sessions was well patterned to display her own virtuosity, with due respect to  the age and experience of the main artiste.Vaidhyanathan (mridangam) and Ramachandran (ghatam) provided laya support that had an enhancing effect on the songs.ForLalgudi Jayaramanthe sruthi alignment (Sruthi Suddham) and the laya consistency (Thala Nirnayam) were emphatic. Her voice had an immeasurable power and  weight (Gaathram) and the curves and twists (jaaru) derived their strength from this voice. What was sung and heard was Carnatic music that was stately and ideologically the purest. That a lady performer at this age could sing for nearly three hours spoke volumes of  commitment that must have given her this stamina.The sabha made a fine gesture by announcing that it proposed to present the title Acharya Choodamani to her, during the Gokulashtami series which happens to be Semmangudi&#8217;s centenary year and Ponnammal happens to be one of his earliest disciples.
