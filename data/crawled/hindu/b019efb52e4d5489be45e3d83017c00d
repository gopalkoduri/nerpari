VLALITHAA KRISHNANEvery once in a while, artistes or organisers make a conscious attempt to come up with something different. This time round though, you wished a bee hadn&#8217;t buzzed in someone&#8217;s bonnet at the TTD Information Centre because it meant a change\u000a in the customary accompanying instrument for a nagaswaram recital.Obliged to part from its majestic tradition-bound partnership with the thavil, Injikkudi E.M.Subramaniam&#8217;s nagaswaram was coaxed into a wary friendship with the violin, mridangam and kanjira. If the combination didn&#8217;t exactly gel as a team, it certainly wasn&#8217;t for lack of trying. Each artiste fared well in his individual capacity. The stumbling block came in the form of kalapramana and an occasionally recalcitrant tala which charted a wilful course until it was sternly yanked back on approximate track by majority consensus.A brisk start with Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8216;Thathvamariya tharama&#8217; (Ritigowla) and measured swaraprastara revealed that the main artiste was indeed in form. A brief sketch of &#8216;Gangeyabhushani&#8217; (mela 33) was an intriguing lead-up to Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Evvare Ramaiyya.&#8217; The kriti, played at a meditative pace, was a piece of finely etched craftsmanship, the accurately captured vivadhi notes testifying to the artiste&#8217;s sadhana.Though the percussive department grew rather enthusiastic and leaned towards a quickening of pace, the main artiste held firm to his chosen kalapramana with resolution. Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Nee Bhakti Bhagya&#8217; (Jayamanohari) with limited kalpanaswaras adopted a sprightly gait.One of Subramaniam&#8217;s  strengths is the piercing intensity and utter steadiness of the shadja, both in madhya and tara sthayi &#8212; the bedrock on which his creative forays rest. This asset came to the fore in his alapanas of Lathangi and Khambodi. Crystal-clear gamakas glittered in the firmament of Lathangi. Whether in the handling of a gently oscillated dhaivata or superfast brigas, an organic unity was evident in the raga&#8217;s development.Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s &#8217;Venkataramana&#8217; with disciplined ordering of sangatis carried the impact of a vocal rendition, the sarvalaghu swaras interspersed with characteristic swirls unique to the instrument.The artiste scored again with Papanasam Sivan&#8217;s poignant &#8216;Thunai Purindarul&#8217; (Varamu). Seasoned pidis and a natural progression of ideas shaped Khambodi, particularly in the tara sthayi.After a decisive rounding off at the shadja, the exposition settled down to a leisurely exploration of the madhya sthayi at the panchama and gandhara suite via long, intertwined garlands.The kizhkala swaras for Tyagaraja&#8217;s &#8216;Evarimata&#8217; were rounded off with definitive vadi-samvadi permutations, the slow swinging gait drawing the listener irresistibly into the mood and moment.V.L Kumar&#8217;s electronically amplified violin tone was on a par with the nagaswaram&#8217;s volume. Swayed by the main artiste&#8217;s drift, he produced eventful essays and octave-traversing passages in his raga expositions.Tirupati P.B.V.Krishnamachari (mridangam) and Thiruvananthapuram D. Rajagopal (kanjira) enriched content with deft rhythmic patterns.Bottom Template Starts
