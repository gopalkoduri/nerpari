VSattiraju Venu Madhav is a promising young Carnatic musician who&#8217;s given a few  vocal recitals in the city and outside and is much sought after artiste by the reputed dancers.His recent performance at Thyagaraya Gana Sabha for the Venkat Arts Academy, which promotes and works for the preservation of Annamacharaya Kirtanas, was a pleasant experience. No wonder that the well known name in this field &#8211; Garimella Balakrishna Prasad &#8211; present in the concert lauded Venu Madhav&#8217;s performance. Incidentally Venumadhav rendered mostly Balakrishna Prasad&#8217;s musical compositons of Annamacharya Kirtanas.It was a thoughtful selection of 15 Annamayya kirtanas. He treated some of them as Carnatic concert pieces withragaandswara prasthara. A nata raga kirtana and thenGnana yagnameegathiin Brindavani gave good launch to the programme.Venkatadriset to music by renowned guru Sripada Pinakapani in raga Vasantha gave weight to his vocal skills.  TheDasaavathara Sankeerthanaset in a folk style andSirutha Nnavvulavaadu Sinnekkain Mohana were exhilarating renditions.  Kolanka Saikumar on violin, Jayakumar Acharya on mridangam and B. Janardan on Ghatam lent apt support.
