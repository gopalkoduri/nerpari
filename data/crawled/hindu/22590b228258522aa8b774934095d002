VKumar Das sang under the aegis of Vasundhara Performing Arts Centre as part of five-day National level dance and music festival, Parangathothsava. Veerabhadrayya Hiremath (harmonium) and Gurumurthi Vaidya (tabla) accompanied the singer.Kumar is one of the rare artistes endowed with the efficiency to convince any serious listener who longs to relish the essence of the lyrics in the light of the luminosity of the ragas radiating when trusted into the hands of competent and imaginative musicians.Whatever may be the movements he spontaneously opts to unfold his imaginations and clarity remained undistorted. Composure and taste precluded him from temptations to get flashy. As a collective result, the bol aalap sections as well as the ancillary ones constituting the bandhishes carried the listeners to meaningful ecstasies: discretion prevailing, refinement marked the taans and sargams in delicate proportions. Introductory airs of Puryadhanashri at once pointing at the distinctness of it, prepared the audience before hand to enjoy the cheez, &#8220;Abto Rithuman&#8221;. Sargams interspersed between important pieces of the lyrics at different stages of the badhat sumptuously complemented the composition.Similar meritorious patterns characterised the next passages that followed in Kalavathi (&#8220;Shyama Mandir Aavo&#8221;) and Bageshri (&#8220;Kin Sothan&#8221; and &#8220;Kaun Karath&#8221;). &#8220;Ramagovinda Hare&#8221;, &#8220;Chakorange Chandramana&#8221; (Basavanna) and &#8220;Bedavo Paramanege&#8221; were other absorbing inclusions.Both the melody and rhythm accompanists were mellow and lent meaningful support. ***Archana Bennur, sang under the auspices of Shri Krishna Gana Sabha, accompanied by K.T. Udayakiran (violin), P. Nataraj (mridanga) and M.R. Manjunath (ghata).The young artiste's repertoire rendering the concert lively and absorbing drew attention commanding whole-hearted appreciation. She would invariably introduce the compositions through introductory alapanas; methodically preparing the audience to enjoy the moods to come up in the compositions.Cheyyur Chengalvaraya Shastri's &#8220;Re Re Maanasa Bhajare&#8221; (Naata) featured a short scholarly alapana and a few passages of swarakalpana of the same nature and depth. Few more like &#8220;Bagayanayya&#8221; (Chandrajyothi-Thyagaraja), &#8220;Ninuvina&#8221; (Rithigoula-Shyamashastri) kept the audience transfixed until she reached decisive moments in Dikshitar's &#8220;Shri Sathyanarayanam Upasmahe&#8221; (Shubhapantuvarali), which established her as an artiste of mature competence.Clarity in the narrative sequence brought the import of Dikshitar's composition. This was one of the presentations, which displayed all the merits of the singer at all stages: alapana, neraval (at &#8220;Matsyakurmavaraha&#8221;) and the swarakalpana, deriving further support from the accompanists who suitably reciprocated the singer's improvisations, proving their individual strengths wherever relevant and permissible.&#8220;Bhaavayaami Gopalabalam&#8221; (Yamam Kalyani - Annamacharya) and Jagadhodharana (Kaapi-Purandaradasa) were other absorbing inclusions.
