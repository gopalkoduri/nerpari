VThe three-and-a half hour musical extravaganza &#8216;Clarion 2007&#8217; was presented by a  newly formed musical outfit called Clarion.  It was an impressive exposition of sublime music that encompassed  Classical Western and Classical Indian music\u000a.  The organisers had rightly named the show a &#8216;music buffet,&#8217; for the audience had a wide range of &#8216;brands&#8217; to pick and choose from.The programme began  with a superb recital of  &#8216;Vande maatharam&#8217; by Bhavyalakshmi. As she was joined by Ustad Liyakat Ali Khan on the sarangi, the audience stood up to pay tribute to India.  Soon, a 21-member choir sprang a surprise by rendering the  song in four parts in the typical Western format.The credit for harmonising Desh raga quite ingeniously went to Philip Francis who also conducted it the choir. The show was conceived and directed by Philip, a former cultural diplomat of the Indian Government to the West Indies and a disciple of tabla maestro Ustad Fiyaz Khan. For the next one hour and more, it was a journey through chaste Western classical scores of the 18th century, both vocal and instrumental.The String Quartet by Francis Xavier (first violin), Herald Antony (second violin), Carol George (viola) and Cheem (cello) demonstrated the alluring harmony of  strings. They played Mozart&#8217;s composition &#8216;Corona&#8217; and the South American number &#8216;Lacum Parista.&#8217;The Quartet came up with a memorable recital of the famous &#8216;Sound of Music&#8217; number &#8216;My Favourite Things.&#8217;Ankita, a young  young pianist, showcased her bewitching artistry by essaying Schubert&#8217;s &#8216;Impromptu D 935.&#8217; Mozart&#8217;s Sonata No: 15, first and third movements, were the other number she  presented. Among the choir&#8217;s inputs, George Frederic Handel&#8217;s &#8216;For Unto Us&#8217; and &#8216;Halleluiah,&#8217; both from the album &#8216;Messiah,&#8217; were majestic.The cynosure of all eyes was  Ustad Fiyaz Khan himself. Supported by his grandson Imran on the tabla and Ustad Liyakat Khan on the sarangi, the septuagenarian  expounded teen Taal inspiringly for 45 minutes.  Laudable was the wizardry that turned the percussion instrument into a musical one. The young flute wizard Rison presented his own composition &#8216;Winds of Ecstasy,&#8217; in which flutes of all varieties, including, recorder and key flute of the West and a Pan flute were employed. The ambience of a deep forest that he had created with the instruments was praiseworthy.Fusion exponent Josy demonstrated how the bass guitar could play a lead role through his solo performance. The ensemble by Joboy (drums), C.T. Francis (bass guitar), Johnson (lead guitar) and Robin (keyboard) was ecstatic. A fitting finale was a solo by  Joboy whose artistry  recreated the fireworks of Thrissur Pooram.  The programme was staged at Lulu International Convention Centre.
