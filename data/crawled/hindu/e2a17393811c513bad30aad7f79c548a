VThe third day of the three-day Ragam Tanam Pallavi Series of Saraswathi at the Narada Gana Sabha Mini Hall featured two artists &#8212; V.K. Manimaran and Ushalakshmi Krishnamoorthy.RTP, which has been reduced to a 15-20 minute affair in most of the kutcheris today was given a 90-minute span  so that the artists could do   full justice to their creativity.Manimaran&#8217;s robust voice is his strength but occasional streak uncertainty is  his weakness.The Kiravani raga alapana was  fluent dotted with many  finely nurtured karvais, swirls and links. Some of the segments like the lower region and the madyama section cruises demonstrated his closeness to the raga bhava and Manimaran&#8217;s ability to underpin the stirring melody of Keeravani.The thanam that followed also displayed sobriety. The Pallavi, set in Kandajathi Triputa talam, was on the  well-known line &#8216;Un darisanam kidaikkumo Nataraja dayanithe.&#8217;The niraval, trikalam and kalpanaswaras only in the chosen raga gave fullness and created a warm ambience of Keeravani.The opening was in Hamsadhwani, &#8216;Pahi pahi balaganapathe&#8217; with  swaras and the closing was with   &#8216;Tullumada vetkai,&#8217; the Tiruppugazh verse in Hamsanandi.A few glitches apart, Melakkaveri K Thiyagarajan closely followed Manimaran  and B. Sivaraman was in  high spirits. His compact tani avartanam was worthy.Ushalakshmi&#8217;s choice of Begada RTP was voluble and confident. The raga was presented in two instalments with a few repetitive phrases.  The thanam was vibrant and the pallavi, set in Chatusra Rupakam, went like this: &#8216;Gananatha gunaboda malarpatham kanamum maraven.&#8217; The pallavi not fixed on &#8216;sama eduppu&#8217; was given several tough combinations of the rhythmic variations.In the ragamalika offering Ushalakshmi moved on to Tisra Triputa in Saranga and once again swung back to chatusra rupakam. Apart from Saranga, the appended ragas were Dwijavanthi and Revati. The accent  was more on  demonstrating rhythmic cycles. When the focus falls  onkankku-vazhakku,melody automatically takes a backseat. That happened here too. It was once again Thiyagarajan who  accompanied Ushalakshmi on the violin. Manikudi S Chandrasekharan provided  adequate support on the mridangam.
