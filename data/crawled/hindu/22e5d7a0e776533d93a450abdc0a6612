VDEVAYANI MEDHEKARThe biggest influence in Srinivas&#8217; life&#8230; has been the Pakistani ghazal maestro Mehdi Hassan&#8230;It was an ardent fan&#8217;s tribute. Playback singer and music director Srinivas, a fan of Mehdi Hassan, sang the maestro&#8217;s ghazals   for an enchanted audience at  Vyloppilli Samskriti Bhavan, Thiruvananthapuram.From a Tamil fusion-pop album &#8216;Paarvai,&#8217; advertisement jingles, devotional songs and tracks songs for A.R. Rahman, Hindi film songs and now ghazals, Srinivas has sung them all.Speaking on the earliest influences on his music, Srinivas says that Kishore Kumar is his all-time favourite along with S.D. Burman, Madan Mohan, MSV classics, Illayaraja and Rahman. The biggest influence in Srinivas&#8217; life, however, has been the Pakistani ghazal maestro Mehdi Hassan whose &#8216;Ranjish Hi Sahi,&#8217; which he says he has heard over 200 times, motivated him to embark on the ghazal trail.This influence was evident during Srinivas&#8217; recent  &#8216;Ghazal Nilavu,&#8217; presented by Swaralaya. Captivating the audience with his soulful rendition of the maestro&#8217;s ever popular, and Srinivas&#8217;s personal favourite &#8216;Ranjish Hi Sahi, Dil Hi Dukhane Ke Liye Aa,&#8217; Srinivas was totally at ease with the Urdu diction and the nuances of the ghazal.His mastery over this delicate and difficult art was in full display as he sang his  favourites such as &#8216;Wo Dil Nawaaj Hei Lekin Nazar Shinaas Nahin,&#8217; and &#8216;Aaye Kuchh Abr Kuchh Sharaab Aaye.&#8217; With his talented and versatile accompanists &#8211; Roshan on the tabla, Prakash on the harmonium, Bernie on the guitar and Rason on the flute, this accomplished  singer set the mood for the evening with the ever popular &#8216;Zindagi Mein toh Sabhi Pyaar Kiya Karte Hain,&#8217; &#8216;Rafta Rafta Wo Meri Hasti Ka Saamaan Ho Gaye,&#8217; &#8216;Aaye Kuchh Abr Kuchh Sharaab Aaye&#8217; and &#8216;Ab Ke Hum Bichde toh Shaayad Kabhi Khwaabon Mein.&#8217;Charming the audience with his mellifluous voice and a flawless rendering of the traditional style of ghazals, he had the audience asking for more. Requests for &#8216;Shola Tha Jal Bujha Hoon,&#8217; and &#8216;Gulon Me Rang,&#8217; followed.With &#8216;Laagi re Laagi Lagan&#8217; similar to &#8216;Ennuire&#8217; and &#8216;Sargam chedu Barkha barsein,&#8217; Srinivasan set the tempo.Not confining herself to ghazals, he regaled the receptive audience with &#8216;Azhage Sukhama&#8217; from the Tamil film &#8216;Parthaleparavasam&#8217; without music accompaniment, and two Baburaj songs including &#8216;Suryakanti, Suryakanti.&#8217; Kishore Kumar&#8217;s &#8216;Mere Naina Saawan Bhadon,&#8217; Jaydev&#8217;s &#8216;Ajeeb Saaneha Mujh Par Gujar Gaya Yaron,&#8217; sung by Hariharan on the same tune as &#8216;Kabhi Khudpe Kabhi Halat Pe Rona Aaya,&#8217; and &#8216;Kal Chaudhavi Ki Raat Thi&#8217; also kept the audience enthralled.The interesting medley of ghazals, film songs and light numbers showcased Srinivas&#8217;s versatility and his ability to cater to all sections of music lovers.Bottom Template Starts
