VA distinct feature in the performance of Sabari Girish for Nadopasana was his respectful approach in the interpretation of the songs, particularly of Sri Tyagaraja, because of his good knowledge of Telugu.So the message of the songs, "Teratheeyaga Raadha" (Gowlipanthu), "Kripa Joochutaku" (Chaya Tarangini) and "Narada Gana Lola" (Atana) was well brought out.The influence of sahitya emotion predominated.Vivid and consistentIn the raga alapanas of Atana and Pantuvarali ("Raghuvara Nannu"), there was vividness and consistency.Within his limitations, in his exposition of ragas and kirtanas, commitment to the values of traditional music could be sensed.Without exhibitionistic scholarship, the un-ornamented rendering of kirtanas had its own impact.He was well supported on the violin by A. G. Venkatasubramanian and on the mridangam by Manikudi Chandrasekharan.SVKBottom Template Starts
