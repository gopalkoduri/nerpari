VNadhaa Veena - CDP. Vasanth Kumar Amutham Music (Rs.99)Sukhanubhavam, Sowlabhyam and Sunadham &#151;  these words sum up the experience one gets listening to P. Vasanth Kumar.Lalgudi's Valaji Varnam, full of passionate phrases woven cleverly into beautiful rhythmic patterns, has been played with elan. Dikshitar's ``Maha Ganapathim" (Nattai) rendered in copybook style is replete with swaraprastharams brimming with the raga's essence.The kurraippu kalpanaswara phrases are evocative in Tyagaraja's ``Aparadha" (Rasali-Adi).Vasanth Kumar has showcased the beauty of Hindolam in a purely classical style, followed by a faithful rendering of ``Sama Ganalole" (GNB, Rupakam).The sahithya Meetu (plucking) is impeccable. Periyasamy Thooran's ever popular ``Thaye Tripurasundari" (Suddha Saveri,Kandam) has been essayed neatly without any frills.An awe inspiring Kalyani alapana full of subtle and sweet phrases followed by a tanam performed unhurriedly by him is like watching a left handed batsman executing well timed cover drives and flicks of the toes with nonchalant grace.``Birana" (Shyama Sastri, Kalyani, Adi, Tisra Gati) is a spiritual experience with well-structured swaras in the climax. His soothing touches create a soporific effect.Srimushnam Raja Rao (mridangam) and V. Suresh (ghatam) mesmerise the listener with their controlled accompaniment for the kirthanams and a well-planned tani garnished with attractive sollukattu.Annamalai Reddiar's Kavadi Sindhu is lilting in gait. Vasanthkumar winds up with Dasar's ``Venkatachala Nilayam" (Sindhu Bhairavi, Adi) and Dharmapuri Subbarayar's ``Paru Lanna" (Kapi, Rupakam).The CD takes one through a journey of pure classical music rich in tradition. No gimmicks. No complicated arithmetic. A meditative fare recommended for early morning or late night listening.A word of appreciation to the sound engineer who has mixed and balanced the sound very well.V.
