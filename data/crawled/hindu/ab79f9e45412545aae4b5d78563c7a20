VConcerts serve a true purpose when, on a special occasion like Tyagaraja aradhana, the artist rekindles and reconstructs the contents of the saint's songs laying stress on both the sangita and sahitya dimensions. These aspects can contribute to enhanced appeal when articulation and enunciation of sahityas are softened to impart emotion. But to-day's performances aim at unnatural effect of exuberance. To some extent a woman musician's voice, being naturally gentle, makes melodic efforts easy of achievement.One major unattended factor in sabhas is the casual operation of the mike poorly balanced mainly between the vocalist and the mridangist. It was pronounced in the concert of Gayatri Girish. Club. It looked as if R. Ramesh, the mridangam player was the main performer and Gayatri Girish, the accompanist.The expository technique of Gayatri Girish was distinctly of an authentic quality. In the interpretation of the kirtanas the innate artistic process was given importance than external dressing up by the vocal manipulation. The charm of her recital was that even in spontaneity of expression there was a method without over-reaching artistic limits.Vibrant delineationGayatri Girish handled four raga alapanas &#8211; Pantuvarali (&#8216;Sambho Mahadeva'), Devagandhari (&#8216;Naamoralakimpa'), Vakulabharanam (&#8216;E Ramuni Nammithino') and Bhairavi (&#8216;Thanayuni'). The sancharas in every one of them were meticulously chiselled without dramatising them from the entertainment angle. If only the vocalist had also spaced them properly it would have done more to music's excellence. Of the four, Devagandhari and Bhairavi delineation was vibrant with emotional intensity. A sense of balance and compelling technique were in perfect fusion. As they progressed impressive features were unfolded.The success of the performance was due to the lucidity with which Gayatri Girish laid before the rasikas the beauty of Tyagaraja kirtanas, particularly &#8216;Namoralakimpa' and &#8216;E Ramuni Nammithino.' On hearing them a listener could feel the pulse of Trinity culture.H.N. Bhaskar is a highly talented violinist, but in his solo versions the sancharas carried a sort of assertiveness that ill goes with the sweetness of violin sound.The phrasings chased each other in quick succession without essential spacing creating the impression of raga alapanas in haste.Softer bowing and a sensitive kalapramana would speak of his vidwat and a sadhaka in appreciative terms.
