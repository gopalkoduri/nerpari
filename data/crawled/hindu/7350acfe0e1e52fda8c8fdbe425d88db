VThis concert  is not likely to be forgotten by those who attended it. Each piece was better than the preceding one and the crowning moment was the last, a racy thillana in Garudadhwani. Like all but three of the ten renditions that figured in the concert, the thillana was Balamurali&#8217;s own composition and it bore ample testimony to the vocalist&#8217;s extraordinary creativity.The central piece of the concert was Shanmukhapriya (Sada tava pada sannidhim) composition created and popularised by the vocalist.The previous piece was a lilting Mohanam (Harihara rama of Bhadrachala Ramadas). Both were preceded by alapana, presented in Balamurali&#8217;s inimitable style. In both the essays the stalwart drew applause for his Anup Jalota-like long karvais on the upper sa. It was nice to see violinist Mysore Nagraj cotton on to the style and keep pace with the vocalist.It was also interesting to see Balamurali approvingly voice-follow Mysore Nagraj, vocalising the violinist&#8217;s phrases.The other elements of the concert were a Kalyani (Sogasu ni sommu kalyani ragini), Khamas (Sujana jivana), Hamir Kalyani (Na jane tava dhyanam vina) and Mayamalavagowla (Meru Samana). The Kalyani and Hamir Kalyani compositions were Balamurali&#8217;s own, the other two were of Thyagaraja.Mridangam vidwan Lakshminarayana Raju and ghatam artiste Vaikom Gopalakrishnan were as good as not being there for most part of the concert, but they provided a thrilling tani.A few other observations. It was disappointing that no niraval or swaras figured  except in the Shanmukhapriya piece. Also, except for the Mohanam and Shanmukhapriya, there was no (or too brief) alapana so much so that for most part, the concert sounded like light-classical singing.Second, Balamurali had vocal support, but because of the poor mike  and also because the artist  would not open up and sing confidently, the &#8216;support&#8217; fell flat, leaving gaps in the concert, especially in the early part.  Nonplussed, Balamurali often looked left and right for the sound-man, but to no avail. This was the only disturbance in the otherwise memorable concert.
