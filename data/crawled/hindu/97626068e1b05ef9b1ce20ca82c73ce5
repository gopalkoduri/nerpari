VIn her introductory speech in the CD, poet `Mathioli' Saraswathi mentions the skill of composers Lakshmi Viswanathan, Manibharati and R. Ganesh, who have woven music into the words she had penned over the years.The nine songs in the recently brought out `Isaikku Isaivaan' have been presented by a host of singers &#151;  Gayatri Girish, R. Ganesh, Bala, Uma, Sruthi, P. Radha, Raji Parthasarathy, Pushpa Anand, Deepa Ganesh, Priya Bharath, Janani and G. Srikanth.Beginning with `Irul Neeki' in Bhoopalam and moving on to extol the grace of Maha Shakti and Lord Krishna, the lyrics also touch upon virtues such as patriotism and right values. And all the songs, without exception, seem to lend themselves to dance movements. In fact you can visualise the footwork of dancers rendering movements to the rhythmic beats. So more than the music, it is the dance feel that dominates `Isaikku Isaivaan.'The audio in CD and cassette format, have been produced with the purpose of being given away as gifts to those who contribute to the Nandalala Medical Foundation.The cassettes and CDs may be secured from N.S. A. Narayanan, Ratnam House, No.91/4, Vinayaka Nagar, Kutcheri Road, Mylapore, Chennai &#151;  600 004. For details call: 2467 0893; 2498 3631.MALATHI RANGARAJANBottom Template Starts
