VThe Purab Ang Utsav, a cross-country search initiated by Vinod Kapur &#8212; of VSK Baithak fame &#8212; for singers of the Purab Ang Gayaki that includes genres like Thumri, Dadra, etc., is drawing to the end of round one, with the &#8220;Puraskar Baithaks&#8221; being organised from this coming Saturday. Twelve of the 36 singers who performed earlier in Delhi, Kolkata, and Varanasi have been shortlisted for these Puraskar Baithaks, which will take place in the Wildlife Fund for Nature building, Lodhi Estate.Kapur calls the selection process &#8220;torturous&#8221; since all 36 could not be brought to the Capital. However, his selection panel includes eminent artistes Rita Ganguli, Savita Devi, Purnima Choudhuri, Shubha Joshi, Ritwik Sanyal, Dalia Rahul, Subhra Guha and Malashree Prasad.The line-up7 &#8211; 9.30 p.m. dailySaturday, April 23Aastha Goswami (Vrindavan)Sanjana Chakraborty (Nadia)Aditi Bannerjee (Mumbai)Mansi Majumdar (Kolkata)Sunday, April 24Brajeswhar Mukharjee (Kolkata)Sanjukta Biswas (Kolkata)Mausumi Sen (Kolkata)Anjana Nath (Kolkata)Monday, April 25Dipanjana Bose Chanda (Kolkata)Kakali Mukherji (Siliguri)Madhumita Chattopadhyay (Kolkata)Suranjana Bose (Kolkata)
