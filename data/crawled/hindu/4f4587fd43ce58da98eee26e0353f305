VFOR AN artiste who has practised regularly (Sadhaka),it will be easy to perform that art effortlessly. Rugmini Gopalakrishnan proved this during her veena concert at Changampuzha park under the aegis of Edappally Sangeetha Sadas.Rugmini Gopalakrishnan is the granddaughter of Gayakashikhamani L. Muthiah Bhagavathar and the niece of Nellai Krishnamurthy. She learnt under the tutelage of K.S. Narayanaswami. A recipient of the award for the best veena player in 1954, she is a former Principal of Palakkad Music college.Rugmini started her concert with the Bhairavi Atathala varnam `Viribroni.' This was followed by `Saranam Sidhi Vinayaka' in Saurashtra, `Makelara' in Ravichandrika and `Paratpara' in Vachaspathi. She chose `Nattakurinji' as the main raga for the Thanam for the evening. The thanam she played, a ragamalika (Dhyanyasi, Atana, Mohanam, Malayamarutham, sahana, Varali and Surutti), was marvellous.The kriti `Mamavasada' was played effortlessly and everyone expected a `Thani' to follow this. But it was kept aside for `Pahaaimohana' (Kamas in rupakam thalam) a composition of Kunhikutty Thankachi.  Rugmini concluded her concert with `Theeratha Vilayattupillai' in ragamalika. The recital was really a feast for rasikas.P.R. NairBottom Template Starts
