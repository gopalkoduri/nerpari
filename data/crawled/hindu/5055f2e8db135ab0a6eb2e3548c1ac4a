VWould it not be relevant on an aradhana occasion to present more songs of the saint composer than wearisome vinyasas of ragas? Seshachari was upbeat in this respect in Varali and Raghavachari in Kharaharapriya. Would not the many excellences of Tyagaraja&#8217;s songs themselves be sufficient to proclaim the tall stature of Hyderabad Brothers?Seshachari&#8217;s Varali was no doubt traditional enriched by creativity. The style of presentation was powerfully energetic, controlled and fertilely imaginative. The kirtana was &#8216;Eti Janma.&#8217; Their interpretation clearly brought out the emotional radiance of the composition. The special appeal of this item was well unfolded. If a good artist is one who with minimal phrasings etches the beauties of a raga, Raghavachari&#8217;s Kharaharapriya was not of this genre. Where a few telling sancharas would have sufficed, be let go thirteen to a dozen. An overdose of sancharas, often repetitive, reflected Raghavachari&#8217;s pursuit of fleeting pleasures of musical erudition. Craft more than aesthetics engaged his attention.The song was &#8216;Chitra Ratnamaya,&#8217; not often heard. It stood high and apart as regards the musical values with an intrinsic appeal of its own. Hyderabad Brothers had the right support from the violinist S.Varadarajan, mridangist K.V.Prasad and the kanjira artist Mayuram Sarma. A rich and deep tone constantly prevailed on the violin in its precise and fluent sancharas. There was not even a faint suggestion of faltering or a minimal sag in tonality. In Varadarajan&#8217;s solo of Varali and Kharaharapriya there was perceptively pervasive brilliance. To his felicitous play he brought the weight of his experience. A clear stream of musical values ran along aesthetic pathways.K.V.Prasad, with the kanjira player, offered an impeccably graceful laya support. It reflected the subtle inter-relationship between song and sound pattern. His technique stressed that percussive aid had deeper import than merely running after beats.Earlier, Mambalam Sisters, Vijayalakshmi and Chitra provided a creditable recital of songs and ragas, Kalyani (&#8216;Nammi Vachchina&#8217;) and Khambodi (&#8216;Maa Janaki&#8217;). Their raga delineation captured the essential fundamentals with a sense of balance. The respect they showed in their interpretation of these two songs and others, &#8216;Ilallo Prana Tharthi&#8217; (Atana), &#8216;Kanna Thalli&#8217; (Saveri) constituted the merit of the recital. A view of musical fervour permeated their presentation.R.Hemalatha (violin), being their sister, could easily anticipate the minds of the vocalists and so her cooperation was wholesome. The simple straight-forward approach was on familiar lines, but the satisfaction for listeners was well addressed. Thanjavur Subramaniam (mridangam) with K.S.Rangachari (kanjira) provided a brief but restrained thani.
