V&#8216;Sarvamangal Ganesh&#8217; (Times Music; CD: Rs. 195; cassette: Rs. 45) contains eight well known pujas rendered by the melody queen to Mayuresh Pai&#8217;s arrangement and direction. They include such Western India favourites like the Siddhivinayak Santati prapti and the Ganesh mahamantra and gayatri.The rendering is quiet and thoughtful &#8212; unlike most &#8216;seasonal&#8217; offerings these days which seem to be influenced by television coverage of the more boisterous &#8216;sarvajanik&#8217;  Ganesh utsavs in places like Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad.The same music company has also rolled out a popular compilation of Ganesha aartis by what is almost a reliable and perennial repertory company of singing talent at puja time: Suresh Wadkar, Usha Mangeshkar, Jagjit Singh and Ravindra Sathe &#8212; offering 15 well loved aartis and post-aarti prayers (CD: Rs. 150; cassette: Rs. 45). Timely releases for this year&#8217;s Ganesha festivities.
