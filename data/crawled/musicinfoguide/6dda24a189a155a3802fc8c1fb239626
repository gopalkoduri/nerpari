Since childhood, he imbibed his family's interest in spirituality and composed several keertanas on Raama. His devotion to Vaikunta Rama at the temple at Bhadrachalam, a small village in the middle of the jungle on the northern banks of the holy river Godhavary, earned him his name Bhadrachala Raamadaas. His guru was Raghunatha Bhattacharya.<br />During the reign of Abdul Hasan Tana Shah,(the nawab of the Qutub Shahi Dynasty at Golconda), Ramadas (Gopanna), thanks to his uncle Madanna, was appointed as a Tahsildar at Bhadrachalam, a pretty and picturesquely situated temple town on the Godavari river. Ramadas was always distracted and his intense love for Lord Rama compelled him to build a temple at Bhadrachalam. He collected money for the construction from the citizens, but didn't have enough. So he borrowed from the tax revenue of the nawab and gave his god a worthy abode, vowing to return the money. The nawab was furious and sentenced Ramadas to <span style="color:#ff6666;">12</span> years in prison. Raamadaas thus earned the name Bandekhana Raamadaas. Frustated at god's indifference to his pleadings, Ramadas composed some of the finest keertanas in his prison cell (reminding Raama of his services in Ishvaku Kula Tilaka).<br />It is said that <span style="color:#ff6666;">Raama &amp; Lakshmana</span> in the guise of two youngsters paid up his dues and got his release papers. The golden coins paid by Raama are known as Ram Tanka coins .They can be seen even today. These coins have the Pattabhishekam scene on one side and the picture of another Rama Bhaktha, Hanuman, on the other side. The nawab was moved and recognized the greatness of Raamadaas and released him immediately and gave him land around Bhadraacalam to continue his dedicated service to Bhadrachala Raamamoorty. Raamadaas spent the rest of his life on these lands and composed further moving poems that were to inspire Tyagaraja: in ksheera saagara sayana in devagaandhaari, he says <span style="color:#3366ff;">"Dhirudau Ramadasuni Bandhamu dirchinadi Vinnanura Rama?"</span> (O Rama! I have heard how You obtained the release of the bold Ramadas from his prison life) ; in brindaavanalola in thodi, in kaligiyunde gada in keeravaani, in Emi dova balkuma in saaranga and in Prahlaada Bhakti Vijayam he says <span style="color:#3366ff;">"kaliyugamuna vara bhadra calamuna nelakonna raamacandruni pada bhaktula kella varudanandagi velasina shree raamadaasu vinutintu madin"</span> (I praise Sri Raamadaas, who shines in this world as the supreme devotee of Sri Raamacandra, who shines forth from his seat at Bhadraacalam in this kali Yuga). </p><br /><p><span style="color:#ff6666;">Background:</span> Named Gopanna by his parents Linganna and Kamalamba, he became known as Ramadas (Das meaning servant or slave), because of his deep devotion to Lord Rama. </p><br /><p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Region:</span> He belonged to Nalakondapalli, a small village Andhra Pradesh.</p><br /><p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Mudra:</span> Bhadraadivaasa, Ramadas </p><br /><p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Contribution:</span> He composed in the keertana form (the precursor to the Kriti form) and his songs contain multiple Charanams. Tyagaraja seems to have been a great admirer of Ramadasa\u2019s devotion to Rama and praises him in a few of his compositions. His language is very simple and music very pleasing. His works include Manache Sloka, Dasabodha and Sundara Kandam of Ramayana.</p><br /><p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Theme:</span> The theme was predominantly devotion.</p><br /><p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Languages used:</span> Mostly Telugu and occasionally Sanskrit.</p><br /><p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Signature:</span> He used several mudras like Bhadrachala, Bhadradri or Bhadragiri.</p><br /><p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Popular Compositions:</span> Emayyarama (Kambhoji), Rama dayajudave (Dhanyasi), Paluke bangara mayena (Anandabhairavi), Nannubrovu (Kalyani) etc. Other compositions are positive invocations, favored by traveling minstrels, including the Tondaiman rulers of Pudukottai in Tamil Nadu, who popularized his songs. Among his other accomplishments is the creation of the whole Ramayana story in the form of a prose-poem, a Choornika. Ramadas described himself in this way in the last verse of his Dasarathi Satakam: "Allana Linga Mantri Suthudu(son), Atreya Gothrudu, Adi Sakha , Kancherla Kulothbhavudu, Gopakavindrudu." Bhadraacala Raamadaas lived for <span style="color:#ff6666;">68</span> years. </p><p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Compositions:</span> </p><p>alola tulasi - shankaraabharanam<br />adugu daati - mohanam<br />amma nannubrovave - saveri<br />antaa raamamayam - aananda bhairavi, kaamavardhani<br />bhajare shreeraamam - kalyani<br />caranamule nammiti - kapi<br />dasharatha raama - shankaraabharanam, kaapi<br />dheena dayaalo - bhairavi, kaapi<br />diname sudinamu - kaapi<br />E teeruga - naadanaamakriyaa<br />edanunnaado - naata kurinji<br />ee vela nannu - kamas<br />emayya raama - kaambhoji<br />ennagaanu raama bhajana - kamavardhani<br />ento mahaanubhaavudavu - shankaraabharanam<br />etiki dayaraaduraa - mukhaari<br />evaru dooshincinanemi - aananda bhairavi<br />garuDagamana raaraa - shurutti, kaamavardhani<br />hari hari raama raama - dhanyaasi<br />itaramu leruganayyaa - shankaraabharanam, naadanaamakriyaa<br />kaakutstha tilakudu - asaveri<br />kamalanayana vaasudeva - shenjurutti<br />mithilesha tanaya - kaambhoji<br />muchhataina naadavemiraa - huseni, naadanaamakriyaa<br />naa moraalakimpa - vasanta<br />narayana narayana - shankaraabharanam<br />nammina vaarini - dhanyaasi<br />nannu brovamani - kalyani<br />narahari deva - yaman kalyani<br />narulaara chedi - shankaraabharanam<br />O raama nee - yamunaa kalyani<br />O raghunandana - madyamavati<br />O raghuveera - kedara gowla<br />paahi maam raamaayante - yadukula kaambhoji<br />pahi raama prabho - madyamavati<br />paalayamaam shree - madyamaavati<br />paavana raama - dhanyaasi<br />paluke bangaara maayenaa - aananda bhairavi<br />raama daivashikhaamanee - thodi<br />raama raama bhadraacala - neelaambari, aahiri<br />raama raama raama - mukhaari<br />raama raama seetaaraama - aananda bhairavi<br />raama raama shreeraama - dhanyaasi<br />raama sudhaambudi - saveri, madyamavati<br />raamaa dayajoodave - dhanyaasi<br />raamaa naa manavi - aananda bhairavi, asaaveri<br />raamabhadra raaraa - shankaraabharanam<br />raamajogi mandu - vasanta, kamaas<br />raamakrsihna govinda - dhanyaasi<br />raaraa naavenna - kambhoji<br />rakshincamanu marokkeda - sahaanaa<br />seetaaraama seetaaraama - huseni<br />shree raama naamamu - naadanaamakriyaa<br />shree raamula - saveri<br />swaami nanu - shurutti<br />taraka mantramu - dhanyaasi<br />tagunayya dasharatha - shankaraabharanam<br /></p><br /><div></div>
