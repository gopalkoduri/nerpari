In fact, he is considered an avathara (incarnation) of Saint Valmiki. Tyagaraja\u2019s compositions are rich in devotional and philosophical content. They are noted for their superior structure, superb handling of ragalakshanas and apt choice of raga and words. The world of Carnatic music owes a lot to Saint Tyagaraja for the treasure that he is bestowed on them</span><br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(51,51,255)">Every year on \u2018pushya-bahula panchami\u2019 day (incidentally today), thousands of musicians throng the sanctum sanctorum of Saint Tyagaraja at Tiruvaiyaru on the banks of the river Cauvery to offer their musical tributes to the great composer. Saint Tyagaraja is believed to have reached the abode of his favourite diety Sri Rama on this day, in the year 1847. Since then, the \u2018Tyagaraja Aradhana\u2019 is commemorated on this day every year.</span><br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(51,51,255)">It is believed that Saint Tyagaraja was born on the 4th of May 1767 at Tiruvaroor. (The life-history of Tyagaraja as we now know, is only from the palm-leaf document of his disciple Sri Venkatramana Baghavathar and from the notoebooks of Sri Krishnaswami Baghavathar (son of Venkatrama Baghavathar)). Tyagaraja was born as the third son to Sri Ramabrahmam and Smt. Seethamma. Sri Ramabrahmam was patronised by the Tanjore prince Thulajaji II. Sri Ramabrahmam earned his living by giving discourses in Ramayana and singing bhajans. Tyagaraja actively participated in the religious activities of his father. Once, during one of the daily \u2018poojas\u2019, Tyagaraja sang \u2018Namo Namo Raghavaaya Anisam\u2019 in the raga \u2018Desiya Thodi\u2019, a krithi which he composed spontaneously.</span><br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(51,51,255)">Upon hearing this krithi, Sri Ramabrahmam brought Tyagaraja under the tutelage of Sri Sonti Venkataramayya for advanced musical training. Then on, Saint Tyagaraja composed hundreds of krithis wherein he extolled his favourite diety as a brave warrior, a King, a Hero. Krithis praising Sri Rama\u2019s eloquance, gait, skill in archery were also composed during this period. Saint Tyagaraja is said to have had a glimpse of Sage Narada through his immense devotion. Sage Narada is supposed to have had gifted the musical treatise \u2018Swararnavam\u2019 and Tyagaraja\u2019s krithis \u2018Sri Narada\u2019 and \u2018Vara Narada\u2019 express his gratitude to the Great Sage.</span><br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(51,51,255)">The Five Keerthanas known as \u2018Pancha Ratna Krithis\u2019 sung during the Aradhana are Jagadananda (Nata), Dudukugala (Gowla), Sadinchanae (Arabhi), Kana kana Ruchira (Varali) and Endharo Mahanu Bhavulu (Sri). These krithis are like epics in size and content.</span><br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold; COLOR: rgb(51,51,255)">A word about his devotion and love of God. Like a doting child to its mother or the suckling calf to the cow, he runs to his Rama to report, explain, complain, appeal, solicit, beg, weep or to protest and get angry with. Rama was the warp and woof of his very existence.</span></div>
