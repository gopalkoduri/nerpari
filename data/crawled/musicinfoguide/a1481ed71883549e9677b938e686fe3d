The <span style="color:#ff6666;"><em>Sama-Veda</em></span> (one of the four volumes of the Holy Scriptures the others being: <em>the <span style="color:#ff6666;">Rig-Veda, the Yajur-Veda and the Artharva-Veda</span></em>) is thought  to  have laid the foundations for Indian music for it is within this volume that many of the hymns and prayers in the <em><span style="color:#ff6666;">Rig-Veda</span></em> were set to musical tunes. The seven swara system in Carnatic music is also Vedic in origin.<br />In line with most other aspects of Indian culture it is also thought that there are many divine origins in Carnatic Music. Carnatic Music is very much associated with Hinduism (the dominant religion in India) with many songs praising a God or Goddess. Some Gods and Goddesses are also linked to certain instruments e.g. Krishna and the flute and Saraswathi and the veena. Many literary epics such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana also contain references to Carnatic Music. Perhaps most significantly, the <em>Yajnavalkya</em> Smriti (one of the three main Smritis, written by sage Yajnavalkya of Mithila) says: </p><br /><p align="left"><br /><strong>"Veena vadhana tathvangna sruti, jathi, visartha talanjaaprayasena moksha margam niyachathi"</strong></p><br /><p align="left"><span style="color:#000099;">("The one who is well versed in veena, one who has the knowledge of srutis and one who is adept in tala, attains salvation without doubt.")</span></p><br /><p align="left">Many aspects of Carnatic music are also thought to be derived from Ancient Tamil Music. Pann (the melodic mode which has been used by Tamil people since Ancient times) is thought to be the precursor to the raga system that is found today in Carnatic Music. The rhythmic meters found in Thirupugzh, for example, bear a resemblance to talas that are used today. Tamil works like <em>Silappadikaram, Tolkappiam</em> and other Sangam literature works give old Dravidian names for the seven notes in the octave, and describe how new scales can be developed by the modal shift of tonic (shifting the reference <em>Shadja</em>) from an existing scale. </p><br /><div></div>
