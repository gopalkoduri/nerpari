V<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><b>By MV Swaroop</b><br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SuRcWem7Q5o/Tyks1TCnAWI/AAAAAAAAASU/ct-kl0_qqkU/s1600/t_brinda.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SuRcWem7Q5o/Tyks1TCnAWI/AAAAAAAAASU/ct-kl0_qqkU/s200/t_brinda.jpg" width="186" /></a></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">I have turned to T Brinda\u2019s music, over the years, in moments of despair and anguish, not because her music comforted or reassured me, but because it shared that sense of desperation, that longing, and revelling in that emotion, as if it were a desirable place to be. When I heard her sing <i>Sakhi prana,</i> I could feel her pouring her life into singing prana at the start of the song. When she sang <i>Dharmapuri vaasudu</i> <i>nannu marachene</i> (She takes some liberty by cutting the line at Dharma, and starting the next one with <i>puri,</i> but we can excuse that), she wailed, almost. When I first heard her sing <i>Mosamaya</i> in Ahiri, I didn\u2019t sing any other raga for weeks. So, when I imagined her singing, my mind pictured emotions running riot on her face, it imagined a face, as a friend put it, \u201cin character\u201d, it pictured a musician consumed by her music.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">And then, a year ago, I discovered this video on YouTube. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://2.gvt0.com/vi/_gYUmoGanpI/0.jpg"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_gYUmoGanpI&fs=1&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_gYUmoGanpI&fs=1&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></object></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">She sits there, her right hand calmly placed on her lap, staring slightly left of the camera, a slightly distant look on her face. Her saree is a dignified dark blue, nothing striking or flamboyant, draped in the most natural manner. Vegavahini, her daughter, is next to her, in a saree slightly flashier than Amma's. She looks almost bored. Without any warning or change of expression, Brindamma lets out three casual phrases that drown the listener deep in Mayamalavagowla. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Wait, I thought, when I first watched it, where is that voice coming from? She didn\u2019t move her hands, she didn\u2019t close her eyes, she didn\u2019t seem to focus. Nothing. She just sang. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">With befuddling ease, she launched into a sprightly <i>Merusamana.</i> Those near-perfect gamaka-s were all there, sometimes filling up even the smallest intervals with a startling twist, a throwaway inflection or a slight quiver; and sometimes leaving a phrase strikingly bland. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">I felt that familiar melancholy, that slight longing in her voice. But I didn\u2019t see it. She seemed so unmoved, so untouched by the beauty of her own music, it almost seemed like a still photo with an accompanying voice. I felt cheated. No one can produce music like that and remain so completely unaffected by it, I thought. It can't come so effortlessly, can it? It can't take so little out of the musician.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Maybe she isn\u2019t unaffected by it. Perhaps the emotion is there, but I, not being as perceptive of subtlety, cannot see it. Perhaps she hides it deliberately. Perhaps the music comes from somewhere else - a place so deep within her that even the emotion takes a long time to reach her exterior. Perhaps she cried, as I did when I heard it, on some other day, when no one was looking. Perhaps she did not.</div></div>
