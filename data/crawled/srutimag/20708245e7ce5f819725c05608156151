Another Vaidyanathan, Soolamangalam Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, described a Vaidyanatha Sivan concert at Tiruvaiyaru thus: \u201cGifted with a voice unparalleled for its beauty and grandeur, he sang Kalyani as the main raga that day and followed it up with the pallavi, <i>Taraka Brahma svarupa.</i> Avoiding non-euphonious phrases like \u2018tarina-tarina\u2019 and \u2018adarina\u2019, he sang the <i>raga</i> in the true Karnatic style.\u201d (from <i>CAMEOS,</i> a collection of Bhagavatar\u2019s writings on Carnatic musicians, Sunadham Publications).</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a(Vaidyanatha Iyer, for that was Sivan\u2019s name, received the title \u2018Maha\u2019 from the pontiff of the Tiruvavaduturai Mutt during a concert at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaikudi" target="_blank">Karaikudi</a>).</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMaha Vaidyanatha Sivan was a composer, credited inter alia with creating a ragamalika song featuring the 72 melakarta ragas.

The alapana for the major raga was spread over an hour and a half or even two. This was then followed by a ragam-tanam-pallavi in <i>anagatagraha,</i> with the composition starting after the tala. The concert ended with a couple of compositions in rare ragas. It was not unusual for the alapana to go on for two hours. He performed at the courts of Mysore, Travancore, Ramnad and Pudukottai, staying for months on end sometimes.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMaha Vaidyanatha Sivan was an erudite scholar in Tamil and Sanskrit, and was honoured for his scholarship in both.
