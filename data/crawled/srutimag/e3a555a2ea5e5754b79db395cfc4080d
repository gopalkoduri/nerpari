The following observations on the audience types and their reaction may interest the general body of concertgoers. No offence is meant towards anyone and the sole aim of this article is to help enhance the musical joy of concert-listeners.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The most passive type of audience member can be called the \u2018reading type\u2019, who keeps reading a book or a magazine quietly, although sometimes whispering the words or turning the pages audibly. Then there is the \u2018encroaching\u2019 type, who would like to rest both hands on his chair handles, allowing no elbow space for neighbours; the \u2018finicky\u2019 type, such as the lady who is reported to have insisted on being flanked only by ladies on both sides; the \u2018annoying\u2019 type, who claims another\u2019s seat on the ground that his own defective vision requires his sitting close to the artistes, or his weak hearing demands sitting straight in front of the loudspeakers; the \u2018garrulous\u2019 type, who keeps chatting away somewhat loudly on all and sundry matters; the \u2018singing along\u2019 type, who hums the ongoing raga or the kriti, often at a tangential sruti; the \u2018guessing\u2019 type, whose audible guess of the raga has a broad spectrum; the \u2018inquisitive\u2019 type, who keeps asking for the names of the ragas or other information; the \u2018critical\u2019 type, who openly criticizes the performers; the \u2018nostalgic\u2019 type, who bemoans the disappearance of the artistes of a former era; the \u2018tala enthusiast\u2019, who cannot help keeping an aggressive tala count that perilously extends to the neighbour\u2019s lap; the \u2018tit-bit munching\u2019 type who acts as a catalyst in switching the thoughts of those nearby from the&nbsp; music to the canteen; the \u2018bad odour radiator\u2019, who unwittingly sends out bad odour, forcing you to take evasive action and turn your face towards the other side; the \u2018showy\u2019 type, who, if a woman, wears the latest fashion attire, a dazzling sari or a sparkling ornament and hair over-decked with flowers, and if a man, prominently browses the latest model of mobile phone, occasionally showing off his gold chain or wrist watch, sometimes with an unsolicited chat about when and where the item was bought; the \u2018seat reserving\u2019 type, who keeps a handkerchief or other personal item on a seat and turns up at his or her own sweet time to claim the seat; the \u2018VIP\u2019 type, who invariably walks in after the performance starts and makes sure he is escorted to a front row seat; the \u2018walk out\u2019 type who walks out at will, as when the tani avartanam starts and comes back either when it is over or whenever he chooses.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Fortunately for Carnatic music, there are many genuine rasikas forming the majority of the audience, who are well conversant with the nuances of the melody and the intricacies of the rhythm, who gently sway their heads in unison with the music and break into an occasional, muffled \u2018aha\u2019 or \u2018sabash\u2019, deriving supreme bliss in the process.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
