A graded artiste of Doordarshan and All India Radio in vocal classical, Girija has been active in the music and Bharatanatyam field for over four decades. She is at present a lecturer in music at the Tamil Nadu Govt. Music College. Her unflagging enthusiasm has been the key to her success.</span></i><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Your mother played a big role in shaping your music. </span></b><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I come from a musical family, and without a doubt, it was my mother who made me the musician I am today. My grandmother used to sing beautifully. Although she never took it up as a profession, she had great interest and knowledge in Carnatic music. My mother Savithri Srinivasan learnt Carnatic music from the Music College in the 1960s, passing out with distinction. She used to practise regularly even after I was born. She was well versed in Telugu and could write poetic lyrics at a moment\u2019s notice.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I learnt many things about life from my mother. She was very active till her demise about a year ago. She constantly pushed me to further my growth and learning. There was no question of rest. In fact, she would say that our end should be the only time we take rest \u2013 once and for all! That motivation has kept me going all these years. I am always looking for new ways to kindle my interest and learning.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">What was your early exposure to music?</span></b><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When I was about three years of age, she was practising a kriti in Mayamalavagowlai and I started identifying the swarams. Realizing that I had a talent in music, my mother decided to teach me Carnatic vocal. At five, she decided to train me in Harikatha and she requested Sri Saidai Tevaram. T. Natarajan (her Tevaram teacher) to teach me. At first Vaadyar said I was too young to learn Harikatha but at my grandmother\u2019s and mother\u2019s insistence, he finally agreed. The first two stories I learnt were the Kannapa Nayanar Charitram and Karaikal Ammaiyar. Along with my mother I also learnt tevarams from him. Besides learning continuously from my mother, I took part in a lot of competitions in tevarams, padavarnams, padams, keertanams and so on. I acquired an extensive my pathantaram. I can only thank my mother\u2019s strict mentoring for that. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I was more her disciple than her daughter. My guru bhakti towards her was more than my relationship to her as her daughter. In fact, I was more a child with my father! With my mother, I obeyed her to the hilt and never questioned her \u2013 even as a mature adult.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Do you remember when you first performed on stage?</span></b><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I was seven and my family wanted to arrange my arangetram. They were not sure how to go about the arrangements but my vaadyar told them to hold my first concert at the Sankara Math nearby. I was so tiny then and was almost lost in the big crowd there. One of the chief guests Vaidyasubramaniya Iyer presented me with a silver lamp which I still light in my puja room everyday. I soon started performing everywhere and was known as Baby Girija. For my second performance arranged in Alwarpet, I remember my mother coming late for my performance as she was in the taxi behind mine. I cried and refused to sing until I saw her! This is my 47th year as a Harikatha artiste and I can say with humility with the blessings of many great vidwans and well wishers I have been able to develop my talents to this level.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">You received many awards and titles at a young age.</span></b><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The first title I received was \u2018Kala Rathnam\u2019 from Pudukotai Sri Santananda Swamigal. I then received the title \u2018Naavanmai Mikka Nallisai Selvi\u2019 from my guru in 1970. In 1978, I received the second prize for classical music from All India Radio. It was presented by Lalgudi Jayaraman sir. I received these titles at a young age but at no point did it give make me proud. My mother believed that as you grow as an artist, you must become more and more humble.&nbsp; </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I remember that once I attended my school exams with flowers in my hair as I had to perform right after the exam. As children do, my friends teased me and I retorted that I was talented and could do many things. Fortunately or unfortunately for me, my mother overheard this! She took me to one side and told me that what I had said in pride was wrong and that learning is a lifetime journey. She said that every time I went on stage, it was a test and I was not to ever think that I knew everything. Her words ring in my ears even today. She showed me the path to my music and my life.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">What are some of the memorable moments in your career?</span></b><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When I was about 13, I won the Padavarnam competition and the judge was none other than Brindamma. I remember her saying to me with a twinkle in her eye, \u201cGirija, people say that only I am capable of singing padavarnams but today you have proved otherwise\u2019. I treasure her words of encouragement.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I was the first artiste to record Harikatha for Doordarshan. It was for fifteen minutes and we did not have a TV in those days. I peeped through a neighbour\u2019s window to watch that broadcast!</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">In 2000, I received the Kalaimamani title for my music for vocal accompaniment for Bharatanatyam. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When did you start singing for Bharatanatyam?</span></b><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">In 1980, Mr. Sankaran from the sabha recommended my name to Dr. Vyjayantimala Bali to sing for her. At that time I did not know what a Bharatanatyam repertoire consisted of. However I chose the padavarnam \u2018Atimohamkonda\u2019 in Mohanam. I remember this varnam very well because it requires so much breath control and is so slow paced that when I was young, I found it boring! My mother advised me to learn these varnams as she said it would also help my chronic wheezing. How right she was! </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">For Vyjantimala\u2019s performance, I sang \u2018Sumasayaka\u2019 in Kapi, which I learnt directly from her. In 1981, I got married and moved to Calcutta for a few years. On my return, I joined the Padma Seshadri school to teach music, slokas and Sanskrit. Mrs. YGP asked me to sing for Madhuvanti Arun. From then on, I sang for many dancers \u2013Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam, Krishnakumari Narendran, Rhadha, KJ Sarasa, Dr. Saraswathi Sunderesan, Parvati Ravi Ghantasala and Shobanato name a&nbsp; few. At one time, I sang solely for Sarasa Amma\u2019s school which had many performances. The only time I took a break was for my Harikatha performances. I was happy to receive the Sudharani RaghupathyEndowment award from Natyarangam in 2012 for my music for Bharatanatyam.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">How did you learn compositions for Bharatanatyam performances?</span></b><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I would notate all the songs as Sarasa Amma sang during practice. I did not have the habit of recording as we do today. Sujatha Vijayaraghavan also taught me many songs from Rhadha Aunty\u2019s repertoire. I gained experience learning from Dr. Balamuralikrishna and Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan when they composed music for dance dramas. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">You taught in Padma Seshadrischool for many years. Did you enjoy teaching?</span></b><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I loved teaching. So many children have passed out having learnt music from me. I have learnt so much myself from teaching these children. Mrs. YGP often said, \u2018Girija, you may be a great performer but let me tell you the satisfaction you will get from training and moulding the lives of children is unparalleled.\u2019 She was absolutely right. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Did you aspire to become a Carnatic kutcheri performer?</span></b><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I never planned anything. I think our path is predestined. It is true that I lost out on opportunities to become a kutcheri artiste because I entered the Bharatantayam field. Sabha organizers hesitated to give me a slot for Carnatic concerts as they felt I was already singing at their sabhas for Bharatanatyam performances.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Do you teach Harikatha?</span></b><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Many people have expressed an interest to learn, but honestly, I do not know how to teach Harikatha! This art form has so many aspects to it \u2013 music, story telling, sound knowledge of mythology. I imbibed all this at a very young age and it came naturally to me. At PSBB, Mrs YGP encouraged me to teach Harikathato my son which he performed very well in his school days. I encourage my students at college who have good musical skills to learn Harikatha. They learn small stories and perform for the annual day. Unfortunately, after that they do not continue their leaning in this form. Harikatha requires regular practice. Only through experience and performances can you improve.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Which form do you enjoy most, Harikatha or singing for Bharatantyam?</span></b><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I would say both. Both these forms have some common ground. In Harikatha, I sing and do some abhinaya to animate my stories. In Natyam, I sing and someone else does abhinaya. They require different skills. In Harikatha, you have to be somewhat of a linguist. Speaking in different languages depending on where we perform is important in reaching out to the audience. I make it a point to speak a little Kannada in a performance on Purandaradasa in Karnataka or in Telugu in Andhra. In Bharatanatyam, we have to be alert and watch the dancer carefully. With experience, I have learnt to sing watching every move of the performer. In some performances, a vrittam which the dancer and I performed on stage impromptu has worked even better than the practised items. I am also careful about the pronunciation of lyrics irrespective of the language. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">My philosophy in life is simple. I am not ambitious in my musical career because I believe that opportunities will come to us if we are dedicated to our art form. When they come, I believe we must take each performance as an exam and excel. This way, we can focus on the process rather than the result. It makes life so much more satisfying and stress free.</span></div>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
