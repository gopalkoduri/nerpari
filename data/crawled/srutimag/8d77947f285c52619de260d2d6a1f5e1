Participants were asked to first connect to their bodies and find their energy centres. Warming up with yoga and after a sumptuous breakfast, the delegates branched off into the four core classes \u2013 Intermediate Bharatanatyam taken by Mythili Prakash, Advanced Bharatanatyam by Priyadarsini Govind, Bharatanatyam Teacher\u2019s Training by Leela Samson and Intermediate Odissi by Madhavi Mudgal.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />After four hours of rigorous training, with a lunch break in the middle, the participants settled in for an enriching session on Lighting Design with particular focus on Indian classical dance by K. Kalaiarasan \u2013 Technical Director at Apsaras Arts Ltd., Singapore. The session was a great eye opener, giving artistes a clearer perspective of what happens in lighting and stage management.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Followed a session on Ashtapadis in Odissi by Madhavi Mudgal. Ashtapadis \u2013 the eight-line verses penned by Jayadeva and his wife Padmavathy in the work called \u2018Gita Govinda\u2019\u2014are said to bring out the divine leela of love between Radha and Krishna. Madhavi beautifully explained the ashtapadi <i>Yahi Madhava</i> and Radha\u2019s reactions as a <i>khandita nayika</i> to Krishna who has been with another woman. She stressed the need to portray Radha as an <i>uttama nayika</i> with finesse and subtlety.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The next exciting session was just an hour away. <i>Connecting through Dance</i> by Leela Samson, Madhavi Mudgal, Priyadarsini Govind, Mythili Prakash and Prashant Shah was an interesting exchange of thoughts within the panel as well as with the audience in topics ranging from music for dance to solo versus group choreography and several other aspects of dance. Day 2 of DANCE INDIA 2013 came to an immensely satisfying close.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
