Janaki Rangarajan, the \u2018Nadanamamani\u2019 for Season 2011 (she receives the title on 1st December, Kartik Fine Arts) launched her series of performances with an impressive recital. This dancer with a Ph.D in Molecular Genetics under her belt has been a disciple of Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam for over 15 years. Having moved to the USA after her marriage to Aneal Krishnamurthy, she has diligently honed her skills on her own without going astray.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Rbm3DyhcRJU/TtcRQaC28oI/AAAAAAAAAFs/wUl3fO5bILs/s1600/26.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Rbm3DyhcRJU/TtcRQaC28oI/AAAAAAAAAFs/wUl3fO5bILs/s320/26.jpg" width="192" /></a></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">The sankeerna alarippu danced to a Tiruppugazh, was neatly choreographed to suit the theme though it did not strictly adhere to the simple alarippu format. Janaki danced the Charukesi varnam \u2018Innum en manam ariyaadavarpol\u2019 (Lalgudi Jayaraman) in an endearing way without plunging into cloying sringara. It was interesting to watch the impromptu rhythmic dialogues between anklebells and mridanga as the dancer occasionally improvised in the nritta segments. In the two padams which followed, even in the opening lines of each she was able to establish the two very different nayikas (the angry woman in \u2018Inchu boni\u2019 and the naïve young girl in \u2018Tottu tottu pesavaraan\u2019) with her communicative yet subtle abhinaya. The concluding piece was a tillana in Hamsanandi which included Subramania Bharati\u2019s lines. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Watch out for this talented dancer who plans to present a different margam in her programmes during this season.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">BuzyBee is buzzing off in search of honeyed seasonscapes.</div></div>
