Nedunuri is synonymous with classicism, tradition and soulful compositions. We were fortunate to be present when this vidwan \u2013 of the Walajapet lineage of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja\u2019s</a> music \u2013 shared his insights at the forum organised by the University of Hyderabad, under the Distinguished Lecture Series, 2013. He spoke on \u2018The re-construction of the compositions of Annamacharya and Ramadas\u2019.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The proceedings were conducted with wit and humour by scholar Dr. Pappu Venugopala Rao who kept the discussion focussed on Nedunuri\u2019s contribution to the given theme. Though Nedunuri and his guru have set to music more than 200 kritis of Annamacharya, he humbly attributed all the magic in his compositions to God and the beauty of the Telugu language used by Annamayya. Venugopala Rao regaled the audience with anecdotes and poems highlighting the virtuosity of the language as also about Nedunuri who has rendered such immortal gems of Annamayya like <i>Emoko chigurutadhramula</i> in Tilang, <i>Sakala santi</i> in Bahudari and <i>Purushottamuda vevu</i> in Revagupti. An easy camaraderie was evident between Nedunuri and Rao, and the audience hung on to every word.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />When Rao asked him about the choice of ragas for specific compositions, Nendunuri attributed it to the blessings of his guru Sripada Pinakapani. His humility was remarkable \u2013 coming from a musician who has been performing for over seven decades. He said: \u201cThe notes suggested the feeling, God suggested the raga and Annamacharya\u2019s poetic compositions brought out the different dimensions in me\u201d. As he sang <i>Polati javvana</i> in Kharaharapriya and made his way through the subtle gamakas, every flower mentioned in the song seemed to manifested itself. When he sang <i>Okapari kokapari,</i> the imbued sringara shone forth. Most compositions have remained unchanged.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Nedunuri seemed to dance his way through the songs as he rendered <i>Muddugare Yasoda</i> and <i>Paluku tenela talli</i> \u2013 each of a different mood and feeling. He said \u201cDance is integral to music, I can see dance while I sing.\u201d It is no wonder that dancers choose to present Annamacharya\u2019s kritis as tuned by Nedunuri.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Moving on to the compositions of Bhadrachala Ramadas, Nedunuri said that while Annamacharya\u2019s keertanas were inclined towards sringara, the kritis of Ramadas were full of bhakti that could lead to moksha; and it was this element that had attracted him.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Rao revealed that the real name of Bhadrachala Ramadas was Kancherla Gopanna, and he is acknowledged as the <i>aadyudu</i> or pioneer of the bhajana sampradaya. Even though we know of only 152 compositions of Ramadas, <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja</a> \u2013 the great vaggeyakara who cited him in many of his kritis \u2013 considered Bhadrachala Ramadas as one of the five great devotees of Lord Rama.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />As Nedunuri sang <i>Ramajogi mandu gonare</i> swaying and clapping with childlike enthusiasm, the audience too joined him. He said, \u201cYou must convey devotion through the songs, it is important to achieve the goal of life. This is amritam.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Nedunuri also rendered a few <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja</a> kritis. Although <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja</a> has mentioned the ragas for his songs, Nedunuri is credited for setting to music twelve of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja\u2019s</a> untuned compositions.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The evening concluded on a pleasant note when the Pro-Vice Chancellor of the University, Hari Babu, immediately agreed to Nedunuri\u2019s request to institute a \u2018<a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja</a> Chair\u2019 at the university. Later, the maestro made an ardent appeal to safeguard and propagate Telugu literature and the region\u2019s rich musical heritage. The evening of music was best summed up in the doyen\u2019s own words: \u201cMusic has no language, musicians have no age.\u201d</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
