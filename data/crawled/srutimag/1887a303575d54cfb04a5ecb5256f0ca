For some reason, I kept my Carnatic music\u000atraining a closely guarded secret, perhaps because my school, St. Anthony\u2019s, a\u000aconvent school, was rather cosmopolitan, with many Catholic students. The\u000astudents spoke a variety of languages, Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali and so on. I\u000adon\u2019t remember too many Tamil friends, perhaps because I was shy about my\u000aCarnatic music training and didn\u2019t want my schoolmates to know.

No\u000aparticular genre was prescribed in these competitions. The songs could be\u000abroadly classified as light music. Till class ten I sang Lata Mangeshkar and\u000aAsha Bhosle songs. My favourite film song was <i>Satyam Shivam Sundaram </i>and\u000aI won many prizes with it. I loved Asha Bhosle\u2019s songs in Hindi, Marathi and so\u000aon.

We sang film songs of Asha, Lata, Rafi and\u000aMukesh. In time, the group really grew large, with some 20 members.

An ad would first be recorded in Hindi and\u000athen the other language versions. The lyrics would have to be fitted to the\u000atune. And for TV ads, we had to do lip sync as well.

I think he\u000awas there to play the flute for a film song being recorded there. \u201cWhat are you\u000adoing here?\u201d he asked me in surprise. When I told him, he said, \u201cWhat!

Here I was, proud that I\u000awas the jingle queen, singing songs in so many languages, and my friend was\u000amaking light of it. I made a silent vow to show him one day how good I was \u2013 in\u000aa pure spirit of friendly rivalry \u2013 and years later we came together in\u000athoroughly enjoyable jugalbandi-s.</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u000a</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When I\u000aeventually took the plunge into a career in Carnatic music, the choice was not\u000aeasy.

I\u2019m not dancing, am I?\u201d but did not have the courage. He asked me to come\u000aback after a couple of weeks. When I went back, he asked: \u201cWhat did you see in\u000athe mirror? Anything good? You shake your head, twitch your nose, make faces,\u000alook exactly like a monkey. And you make such complicated gestures. You are not\u000asinging anything complicated, anyway.\u201d Tears welled up in my eyes, and soon I\u000astarted crying loudly. I told my mother I did not want to go back.

In time, with\u000aserious introspection, I came to understand his intent \u2013 that of imparting\u000asensitivity and intense internalisation of both raga and content.

After one of my concerts, a listener came up to me and said that she\u000ahad enjoyed my rendering of <i>Krishna nee begane </i>and that she could visualise\u000aLord Krishna. She was certain that I was singing with the image of Krishna in\u000amind. I told her that I was focusing only on the beauty of the raga\u000aYamunakalyani. This has been interpreted as my lack of belief in God. All I\u000ameant was that when I sing, it is the beauty of the raga that overwhelms me. It\u000ais rarely that you think of Krishna\u2019s peacock feather or his butter-stealing\u000aantics, while singing on stage. This can easily be demonstrated by alternately\u000aspeaking the lines and singing them. If I merely utter the words, <i>Krishna\u000anee begane baro, </i>rather than sing them, do you feel any bhakti? Is it the\u000araga or the verse that inspires bhakti?</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u000a</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>You\u000ahave been involved in jugalbandi and fusion efforts.</b></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u000a</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ronu\u000aMajumdar and I first met in Pandit Jaipurwale\u2019s music class. Even then, he\u000acomposed a lot. He\u2019d make me sing those pieces too! I sang them in small\u000achamber recitals during Ganesa Chaturthi or Dussehra. We also did a few\u000arecordings for local circulation. My whole family became Ronu\u2019s fans. You could\u000alisten to his Abhogi forever. He\u2019d play the flute while I sang Carnatic\u000akriti-s, exploring Khamas, Andolika or Mohanakalyani in his own way. Which is\u000awhy, when we came together on the concert platform decades later, the fusion\u000areally worked. We knew each other\u2019s music thoroughly. I have also collaborated\u000awith Shubha Mudgal.</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u000a</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">It was\u000aa great experience singing for Leela Samson\u2019s <i>Navarasa</i>. It was a\u000arevelation for me; my early dance training helped, no doubt. She was very clear\u000aabout what kind of music she wanted and could bring out the best in me.</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u000a</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Another\u000amemorable experience has been singing with a Finnish orchestra at Helsinki,\u000athanks to my friend Eero Hameenniemi. We have had two such concerts so far.\u000aEero has been coming to Chennai for several years, and appreciates Carnatic\u000amusic. He has also studied ancient Tamil literature, and I sang verses from\u000aSangam literature with the Avanti Chamber Orchestra to music Eero had composed.</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u000a</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>T.M.\u000aKrishna and you have been involved in collaborative efforts like <i>Voices\u000aWithin </i>and <i>Svanubhava</i>.

Among\u000aother things, we are also ensuring a future constituency of rasika-s and a link\u000abetween past, present and future.</span></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
