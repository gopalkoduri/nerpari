I was to read it out. It had a mini biography of Oli, Amritha Murali, Ranjani Ramakrishnan, B. Ganapathyraman, Subbaraya Sastry and Annaswamy Sastry - a blend of creative minds that could, on a good day, produce an intoxicating musical cocktail. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a\u201cCoffee?\u201d Bharathi asked, as I scanned the sheet to find some suitably heavy ragas on the list. I was coming straight from work, I could do with a coffee, I said.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe cosy drawing room, which, was empty but for a few sofas lined against the walls, mats covering every inch of the floor, and an iPod docking station filled up over the next forty-five minutes. Musicians, dancers, and rasikas, all settled down around the room in positions they found most comfortable.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aWhen Amritha started with Begada, I realised that listening to mikeless concerts was going to be an exercise in re-training ears. Accustomed to bombardment, the ear was going to take some time to adjust to a voice whose volume was not artificially enhanced to sound louder than the accompanists. It would take some concentration to discern those Begada nuances she was so artfully weaving into her <i>Sankari Neevani. </i></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aIn a concert featuring the Syama Sastry family, it was but natural to expect Brinda\u2019s distinct musical accent to make a haunting appearance. A ponderous rendition of the Todi kriti, <i>Sri Kamalambike,</i> was what we have come to expect from that style - a sort of beauty that seems<i> just</i> out of your grasp. You can\u2019t put your finger on exactly what she is doing, but you know that it is somehow perfect. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aA bright <i>Parama Pavani</i> (Athana) followed, before Amritha sank her teeth into a Kalyani alapana, exploring the reflective aspects of the raga in detail. Ranjani replied in the same vein, employing sensitive phrasing and meaningful pauses. Subbaraya Sastry\u2019s <i>Ninnuvinagatigana</i> has a striking chittaswaram in the swara-sahitya format which the Sastry school has made its own, interwoven with a subtle rhythm that Ganapathyraman picked up on instinctively, and punctuated with the most dextrous pats. His experience and keen understanding of raga came to the fore, as he made the niraval simmer with his playing. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAmritha\u2019s ability to couch her inventiveness in assured maturity was exhibited through a sprawling Bhairavi \u2013 Subbaraya Sastry\u2019s <i>Sri Lalite</i> - at a lively tempo. Ranjani\u2019s violin, which showed a moment or two of misbehaviour in the Kalyani, was back to its pleasing best, as she shadowed the niraval and swarams with verve and vivacity. After a beguiling korvai that took Ganapathyraman by surprise, Amritha signalled to him to play his tani. Without hesiation, he said, \u201cYou continue singing. This feeling is perfect, I don\u2019t think a tani is needed now.\u201d The gesture was a testament to how much he enjoyed playing that evening, how much of the music he appreciated. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAfter the concert ended with <i>Venkatasailavihara</i> (Hamirkalyani) and <i>Vanajasana</i> (Sri), Ganapathyraman told us about his father, Sethalapati Balasubramaniam\u2019s voice, and how when he sang at one end of the street, even without a mike, you could hear it at the other. We hear it in the voices of the pre-microphone generation, don\u2019t we? Mikes have perhaps&nbsp;changed music more than we realise. By the end of this year of Oli chamber concerts, we may have a clearer answer. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i>Oli,</i> a yearlong project, aims to revive the tradition of intense participatory listening, up-close and personal. It features classical musicians in weekend chamber music performances twice a month, from February 2012. Established and up and coming artistes will alternate in this programmes. The senior artistes will showcase ragas and compositions based on their own tradition, special features of their gurus, or distinct aspects of their <i>bani.</i> The young artiste will present a theme-based recital in an attempt to revive and reclaim our musical heritage. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe concert<br />\u000aAmritha Murali - Vocal<br />\u000aRanjani Ramakrishnan \u2013 Violin<br />\u000aB.

Amritha\u2019s resonant voice and fertile imagination in combination with her pathantharasuddham make for a superior grade of music that is vibrant and insightful.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aRanjani Ramakrishnan, a disciple of her mother Sita Ramakrishnan is a much sought after accompanist. Her bowing technique and nuanced taste make her playing absolutely delightful.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aB Ganapathyraman, a disciple of Kumbhakonam Rajappaiyer, comes from a musical lineage. His father, the wonderful singer Sethalapathy Balasubramanian, was a disciple of Papanasam Sivan. Ganapathyraman is known for his lively accompaniment and lends saukhyam and verve in equal measure to the concert.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i>The Theme </i></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSubbaraya Sastry was the second son of the incomparable Syama Sastry. Besides learning from his father, Subbaraya Sastry was fortunate to learn under Tyagaraja himself and interact with no less than Muthuswamy Dikshitar. But the apple never falls far from the tree. Predominantly using his father\u2019s style with \u201cKumara\u201d as his mudra, Subbaraya Sastry composed in Telugu. Only 11 compositions of his have been passed on to this date. Each of his compositions brings forth the essence of the raga in all its splendour. All are in praise of \u201cDevi\u201d except for two, <i>Ninnu sevinchina</i> in praise of Lord Parthasarathy, and <i>Venkatashailavihara</i> in praise of Lord Venkatesa.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAnnaswamy Sastry was the grandson of the illustrious Syama Sastry and the adopted son and disciple of Subbaraya Sastry. All of his compositions are in Samskritam, excepting the kriti <i>Inkevarunnaru</i> in Sahana. He has also composed tana varnams and pada varnams. He did not use a mudra. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAnnaswamy Sastry\u2019s style of composing is very similar to that of his grandfather. The chitta swara in the kriti Sri Kamakshi is noteworthy. Here the raga Saranga shines in all its splendour even without the usage of its characteristic suddha madhyama. What\u2019s more, the swara-sahitya angas in Syama Sastry\u2019s kriti Palinchu Kamakshi and varnam Dayanidhe are said to have been set by Annaswamy Sastry.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe connections continue across the generations. One of Annaswamy Sastry\u2019s disciples, Tanjore Kamakshi, tutored Veena Dhanammal. Little wonder then, that the family of Veena Dhanammal have preserved and popularised the choicest of compositions of the Syama Sastry family in the most pristine manner.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><b>Oli Chamber Concerts</b></i></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i>Oli</i> affords a platform for diverse styles of music, for rendering rare kinds of music, compositions which may not be suitable for a large audience, and allow greater freedom for <i>manodharma</i> music. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aNo microphones will be used so that the tonal qualities of voice and instrument may be reproduced with their natural timbre and resonance intact. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i>Oli</i> features two concerts every month, at different venues; designed for an audience of 30-40 persons. These concerts are free.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aOli Chamber Concerts is an initiative of Gowri Ramnarayan, with Bharathi Ramasubban, MV Swaroop, and Rithwik Raja.</div>
