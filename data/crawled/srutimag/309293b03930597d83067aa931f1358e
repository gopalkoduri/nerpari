His maternal grandfather was Tanjore Upendran, a leading mridanga vidwan of the last century. Music seems to have skipped a generation and found in young Pradeep Kumar, a suitable vehicle for the continuation of the family legacy. As he was born on 31st May 1992, exactly ten months after Upendran died, the family believes that this is not a mere coincidence. It is again no coincidence that Upendran\u2019s good friend Guruvayur Dorai has been Praveen Kumar\u2019s mridanga guru for the last ten years. His arangetram in early 2007 was attended by a glittering array of vidwans and keen rasika-s. This writer was also present and wondered at the mature, precise and clear strokes of the \u2018not-yetfifteen\u2019 year old lad in contrast to the typical arangetram performances. He has not looked back since and now he is among the most sought after young mridanga artists. His school, Chettinad Vidyashram encouraged him no end and he was one of the star performers in school and inter-school events, winning many prizes. Now, he is a first year student of engineering in a Chennai college and takes part mostly in city concerts on weekdays and outstation concerts during weekends.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Praveen Kumar\u2019s first guru for three years from the age of five was Nellai Balaji, a good mridanga player in his own right. Since then, Guruvayur Dorai took him under his wing and a senior disciple of his, Uzhavoor Babu taught the young lad most of the basics under the watchful eyes of Dorai. Dorai is an excellent singer too and it was a great advantage to his disciples in learning to play for songs and even pallavi-s in which Dorai is adept. Normally, one or more vocalists or instrumentalists are called upon for such training. The pallavi sessions with the guru used to run in excess of three hours with each disciple taking turns to play the pallavi format in three speeds followed by tani avartanam-s.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />From the age of twelve, Praveen Kumar has been receiving the government of India CCRT scholarship without a break.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Praveen has played in virtually all the city sabha-s including the Music Academy, Indian Fine Arts Society, Narada Gana Sabha, Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha, Sri Krishna Gana Sabha and Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha. Outside Chennai, he has participated in concerts in Shanmukhananda Sabha in Mumbai, as also in sabha-s in Pune, Mangalore, Salem, and Palani. In the \u201cSpirit of Youth\u201d festival (2007) he was adjudged the best mridanga player and subsequently, he received the Academy\u2019s \u201cCoimbatore Ramaswamy Pillai Award\u201d the same year. Since then, he has been performing in the Academy every year. In fact, in most sabha-s, after the first year\u2019s performance he has been the automatic choice for subsequent years too. He was also the first recipient of the title \u201cCarnatic Idol\u201d in 2007, an event run by Carnatica.com. He was selected the best junior mridangist by MFAC in 2005 and Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha in 2007.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Like many of his peers, Praveen will face a dilemma when he completes studies \u2013 whether to take up engineering or music as his profession. As of now, it is music for him. The actual decision is still a few years away.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: Right;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />(Reproduced from <a href="http://sruti.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=4_6&amp;products_id=287" target="_blank">Sruti 315, December 2010</a>)</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
