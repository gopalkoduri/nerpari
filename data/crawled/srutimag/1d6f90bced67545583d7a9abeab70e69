Lakshmi\u2019s alap in desh in the high sruti of C sharp\u000arang loud and clear. At the conclusion of the alap, she gently touched my hand\u000aand cued me to sing the opening phrase of the Tamil composition. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Several thoughts ran through my head. I was standing next to\u000aa grand old lady just ten years younger than my grandmother.&nbsp; She was from the family of India\u2019s best\u000aknown musician in the western hemisphere. Her name and voice had flashed\u000athrough the title-credits of the Academy Award winning film \u2018Gandhi\u2019 that I had\u000awatched in India in awe in 1983. This lady was a conductor who had directed\u000asome of Ravi Shankar\u2019s ensembles and had worked with George Harrison and\u000aothers. She was a Hindustani musician with an array of recordings and concerts\u000aand a large fan following, a Carnatic musician, a polyglot, an accomplished\u000adancer and more.&nbsp; She had interacted\u000awith such great personalities as Jawaharlal Nehru, S. Balachander, S. Rajam, MS\u000aSubbulakshmi, Pandit Ratanjankar, Madan Mohan (composer of film music)\u2013 just to\u000aname a few. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I woke up from my reverie, sang the song with her and ran\u000aback to the control room to monitor the rest of the production. It was this\u000aopportunity to collaborate with her that led to several musical sessions and\u000adiscussions with Lakshmi Shankar. It was during one such session that it\u000aoccurred to me that Lakshmi\u2019s story needed to be told. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Some seven years after the thought first struck me, I spoke\u000awith Sruti editor Ramnarayan regarding the idea and actually sat down to\u000acompile the information that I had gleaned from her and documented during my\u000amusic lessons and long phone conversations with her.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Lakshmi Shankar first made a name for herself in\u000aBharatanatyam and contemporary classical Indian dance and on the tinsel screen\u000aand then rose to great heights as a renowned Hindustani musician. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Lakshmi is held in high regard in Hindustani music circles\u000aand has etched a name for herself in her own Patiala gharana-entrenched style\u000aof raga exposition. Her solo discography is a long list of albums featuring\u000arenditions in such ragas as dhani, jog and more as well as a litany of bhajans\u000atuned and rendered soulfully. In addition, Lakshmi specialises in thumris and\u000alighter compositions in various Indian languages. Yet, it is interesting to\u000anote that her journey into the the music world began in the realm of Carnatic\u000amusic particularly with the music of Muthuswami Dikshitar.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I had been introduced to Lakshmi through her good friends\u000aSonal Sanghvi and Dr Vijay Sanghvi as their \u2018beloved Guru\u2019; I met her for the\u000afirst time in 1996 when she had attended the premiere of my choral musical\u000atheater production \u2018The Blue Jewel\u2019 in Cincinnati.&nbsp; I even attempted to speak with her in Hindi, completely unaware\u000aof her Tamil origins. It was at Sonalben\u2019s daughter\u2019s wedding in 2003 that she\u000acomplimented me on my Hindustani violin playing and spoke with me in Tamil,\u000aeven while being surrounded by Gujarati and Marathi speaking guests.\u000a\u2018Tamizhlapesa chance kedacha vidamatten\u2019, she had said with a grin, sitting in\u000athe midst of her Hindustani music fans and students.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Lakshmi\u2019s father RV Sastri hailed from Pudukkottai and was\u000aan established lawyer in Madras.&nbsp; Her\u000amother Visalakshi was from Palakkad. Her sister is the well known danseuse\u000aKamala Sastri Chakravorty. TL Venkatrama Iyer, a friend of RV Sastri used to\u000amake frequent stops at the house to teach Dikshitar\u2019s compositions to\u000aVisalakshi. The young Lakshmi grew up listening to these and could reproduce\u000aeverything that she heard.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">She sang <i>Tyagaraja palayasumam </i>and <i>Swaminatha\u000aparipalayasumam </i>in vilambakalam and exclaimed, \u2018This is how TL VenkataramaIyer\u000aused to sing them in the 1930s\u2019. The cutcheri rendition of these compositions\u000ahad already been altered in Lakshmi\u2019s early years.&nbsp; \u2018There is absolutely no connection between how it is rendered now\u000aand how I learned it\u2019, she said. She further quoted her\u000amother\u2019s words of condemnation of maestro GNB\u2019s reduction of this\u000avilambakala kriti into a madhyamakala rendition with \u2018odukkal\u2019 that suited his\u000astyle. She went on to add\u000athat her mother was a great admirer of Veena Dhanammal, and encouraged Brinda\u000aand Mukta.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Lakshmi Shankar was conversant with several of Dikshitar\u2019s\u000akritis; she referrred to the collection <i>Swaminatha, Tyagarajapalaya, Sri\u000aSarasvati, Mamava Minakshi </i>and <i>Sri Kamalambike </i>as the \u2018pancharatna kritis\u2019 of\u000aDikshitar (as told to her by TLV).&nbsp; She\u000arecalled her mother learning <i>Budhamasrayami, Brhaspate, </i>some of the Navavarana\u000akritis, <i>Varalakshmim (</i>Saurashtram), <i>Pahimam ratnachala </i>and <i>Kumaraswaminam </i>from\u000aTLV. \u2018TLV did not have a great voice; he was not an expressive singer either.\u000aBut his repertoire was vast and he was greatly concerned about the compositions\u000aand their lyrics. Amma used to learn from him and I would reproduce what she learned. In fact, I used to be able to reproduce anything I heard\u000aduring that stage. TLV was a close friend of my father\u2019.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Lakshmi Shankar was always a living link between the\u000anorthern and southern Indian performance traditions.&nbsp; She sang in the southern idiom in the mega dance productions\u000astaged by California-based Viji Prakash. She had enjoyed cutcheris in Madras\u000ain her early years; GNB was the rage during her time; her mother was a fan of\u000aMaharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer and she herself a fan of Madurai Mani Iyer. She\u000ahad great regard for Maharajapuram Santhanam in the 1980s, particularly for his\u000a<i>janaranjakatvam</i>. 'I was completely knocked out by Santhanam\u2019, she said.\u000aShe had great words of praise for contemporary vocalists TM Krishna and Sanjay\u000aSubrahmanyan. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">In her later years, Lakshmi Shankar was a regular visitor to\u000asabhas during the Chennai music season,&nbsp;\u000aduring her visits to Chennai in the winter months, when she stayed with\u000aher sister Kamala in her flat in Indira Nagar. It was during one of these\u000aconcerts in Chennai that TM Krishna smiled at her from the dais and launched\u000ainto Hamsadhwani to render the bhajan \u2018Jaya Jayati\u2019 tuned and popularised by\u000aher. \u2018I was pleasantly surprised\u2019, recounted Lakshmi of this experience. Jaya\u000aJayati \u2013 a delightful soundscape of lyrics in Hamsadhwani is just an example of\u000athe numerous bhajans tuned, rendered and popularised by her. Lakshmi Shankar\u2019s\u000aChennai visits ceased after her sister moved out of her flat into the outskirts\u000aof Chennai.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Her Hindustani music concerts drew a wide range of\u000aaudiences. The Hindustani music community in Cincinnati used to invite her to\u000areside in the city and teach music to a number of her fans. Lakshmi Shankar\u000aobliged generously, related personally with each of her students and her stays\u000ahere would conclude with her performance. Dr Vijay and Sonal Sanghvi were her\u000ahosts during each of her visits. When Sonal Sanghvi succumbed young in 2004 to\u000acancer, Lakshmi Shankar was deeply saddened. \u2018I have lost a daughter for a\u000asecond time\u2019, she exclaimed.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Forgotten in the midst of her stature as an established\u000asinger in the Hindustani idiom is the fact that she had been an accomplished\u000adancer in her early years. \u2018I remember her prowess. Lakshmi was very talented\u2019,\u000arecollected S. Rajam in a conversation with me in July 2009, speaking of&nbsp; Balasaraswati and Lakshmi Shankar in the\u000asame breath.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">\u2018I had my arangetram in a blue satin salwar and kurta when I\u000awas 11; I had a zari vest over it\u2019, laughed Lakshmi Shankar as she recollected this experience from the 1930s. She went on to add that costumes were very\u000asimple in those days; \u2018Balasaraswati used to wear very simple costumes; now,\u000ajewellery and costumes have come a very long way.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">After her arangetram she was invited by Uday Shankar to join\u000ahis Almora cultural centre, where her eyes were opened to a world of other\u000adance forms and to Uday\u2019s borderless approach to \u2018movement\u2019. \u2018My mother was\u000avery progressive and she encouraged me to go to Almora; she even came with me\u2019,\u000arecollected Lakshmi. Those were some of her most memorable years. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Lakshmi married Rajendra Shankar, brother of Uday Shankar\u000aand became a daughter in law of the Shankar family. She holds brother in law\u000aRavi Shankar in the highest regard as her \u2018guru\u2019 and a kindred soul.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Each night, the brothers and their wives would gather after\u000adinner to discuss the script, music and choreography/presentation of the\u000avarious acts of Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s book \u2018The Discovery of India\u2019. \u2018Those were\u000asome of the most magical moments\u2019, recollected Lakshmi \u2013 of the creative energy\u000athat would pour forth in those discussions. She played multiple roles in the\u000aballet and has the program notes from this production among treasured\u000apossessions. Prime Minister Nehru witnessed one of these performances. During\u000athe final performance, Lakshmi was diagnosed with pleurisy; she danced with a\u000araging fever and literally collapsed off stage. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">She recovered from her illness, never to dance again. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">If dance was one dimension of Lakshmi Shankar\u2019s artistic\u000apersonality, acting in films was another. She played the role of Sant Tulsi\u000aDas\u2019s consort Ratna in the film <i>Bhakta Tulsi Das</i>.&nbsp; BS Ranga from Bangalore, a cameraman, raised\u000athe finances to produce this picture; the financier was Tamilnadu Talkies\u000aSoundararajan. Raja Iyengar (brother of BS Ranga) was to play the role of\u000aTulasidas.&nbsp; The original music director\u000aof the film was S. Balachander. All four major \u2018ratnas\u2019 of Tulsidas were\u000arecreated in Tamil by Papanasam Sivan and tuned as modern compositions.&nbsp; One of the songs sung by Lakshmi Shankar was\u000a<i>Karunanidhipol katchialippadum kapatanatakama. </i>This song ended up\u000asounding very western. The producer did not like the compositions; he contacted\u000aAnil Biswas to retune the compositions.&nbsp;\u000aLakshmi Shankar\u2019s song came out as a 78 RPM record. Neither the film nor\u000athe recordings are available now. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></i></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">How did Lakshmi Shankar become a Hindustani musician?<o:p></o:p></span></i></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Rendered unable to dance, Lakshmi Shankar in Bombay considered a\u000acareer in Carnatic music; however at the insistence of&nbsp; Ravishankar and film music director Madan\u000aMohan, she came under the tutelage of Ustad Abdul Rehman Khan. \u2018When I met him,\u000aI knew that I had found my guru\u2019, she says. All that she learned for a whole\u000ayear, was raga Todi. All the way from sargam through paltas through alap, her\u000alife was nothing other than the raga. It was the Ustad\u2019s insistence that the\u000adistinctions that she developed in Todi would extend to any raga that she sang.\u000aHer mastery of the idiom grew, until the point where thanks to miscommunication\u000aand gossip, the relationship with her guru soured. Prof BR Deodhar (a student\u000aof Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande) offered to continue to teach her and she\u000adeveloped her own signature style of singing \u2013 marked by an exceedingly sweet\u000aand expressive voice. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">\u2018For a South Indian trying to make a mark in Hindustani\u000amusic, the challenges were many\u2019 recollects Lakshmi Shankar. \u2018Mistakes would always\u000abe spotted first\u2019. It was over the years, that she gained a steady reputation\u000afor her soulful rendition of bhajans, thumris and other compositions. She was\u000afluent in Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali and other languages and her\u000arenditions won her fans all over India.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Lakshmi Shankar regarded Ravi Shankar as a major musical\u000acontributor to her life. \u2018What has he not accomplished\u2019? she asked. \u2018He\u000acompletely captured the world by his music, whether it was classical or folk or\u000awestern or exploratory music. There was nothing that he left out. He was always\u000aa pioneer in everything. Yet, he was very humble. No one knew\u000aCarnatic music&nbsp; deeply as he did. He held\u000athe pedagogical tradition in Carnatic music in the highest regard, especially\u000agiven the diversity in teaching techniques (across gharanas) in Hindustani\u000amusic. He however rued the lack of emphasis on voice culture in Carnatic\u000amusic\u2019.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">One of Lakshmi Shankar\u2019s greatest adventures in music was\u000athe \u2018Music festival from India\u2019 \u2013 a project conceived and executed by Ravi\u000aShankar and George Harrison. This project featured many stalwarts of Indian\u000amusic in their youth: HariprasadChaurasia, Shivkumar Sharma, L Subramanian,\u000aVijayashree, Kamala Chakravarti, TV Gopalakrishnan, Sultan Khan and Alla Rakha\u000a\u2013 literally a who\u2019s who of Indian music.&nbsp;\u000aThe principal sound engineer on the project was Kumar, Lakshmi Shankar\u2019s\u000ason. Lakshmi was the featured vocalist whose sublime voice covered three\u000aoctaves with ease. She was more than the featured vocalist on this project.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Rangasami Parthasarathi of Oriental Records spoke of the\u000amanner in which Lakshmi Shankar served as the intermediary between the maestro\u000aand the musicians in interpreting and teaching the music score. \u2018Raviji used to\u000acome up with ideas spontaneously and I used to notate them\u2019, recollected\u000aLakshmi Shankar. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Indeed, when Ravi Shankar took ill during the tour, it was\u000aLakshmi Shankar who took over the responsibility of conducting this ensemble.

An electronic tanpura filled up her music room, where she sat on a divan. She launched into Jog, Dhani and\u000aother ragas and explained their nuances. She emphasised the need to\u000astart the alap in the tara sthayi if it preceded a bhajan.&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">\u2018It is a <i>pukar</i>,\u000ayou are crying out to the divine\u2019, she illustrated.

She\u000aremembered Palghat Mani Iyer with fondness. He told her on one occasion that he\u000awas going to play for DK Pattammal. \u2018Pattamma, Dikshitar cutcheri izhukkum,\u000araattiri late aagum\u2019, he joked. There were other humorous stories of the\u000astruggles of a shehnai player in the Ravishankar ensemble. Then there were musicological references to the Adi Basant raga in the dhamar <i>Khelat\u000aGhanshyam </i>in the Music Festival project. There were references to the\u000amusical genius of TV Gopalakrishnan.&nbsp;\u000aShe played to me an unpublished recording of a khayal (Sajanva) in Kedar\u000asung by her and TVG as part of Ravi Shankar\u2019s project.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Her music was certainly not uni-dimensional. She recorded\u000afor films. She sang for vaggeyakaras like Ratanjankar. As recently as Dec\u000a2013, when I discussed the dhrupads of Swati Tirunal with her, in preparation\u000afor my lecture demonstration at the Music Academy, she exclaimed, \u2018Ratanjankar\u000atuned them all; he invited me to sing them\u2019. She listened intently to my\u000asinging the ragamala dhrupad and gave me a few suggestions.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">To me, memories of working with her on my oratorio \u2018Shanti \u2013\u000aA Journey of Peace\u2019 are priceless. She travelled all the way from California to\u000aCincinnati at the age of 78 to sing for this production. A rousing ovation from\u000athe 150-member choir greeted her as she came to see one of our rehearsals in\u000aCincinnati. I was amazed by her commitment to the project; I was thrilled at\u000aher writing down the sargam and the lyrics in Tamil as I sang and demonstrated\u000athem.&nbsp; She insisted on staying backstage\u000aand singing seated on a chair. Her alap interspersed with the chants for peace\u000arang clear in the audience as the mixed choir sang my arrangement of the <i>Shanti\u000aPath </i>from the Yajurveda. She was full of encouragement for the oratorio and\u000adescribed it as \u2018a breathtaking experience\u2019.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I had invited her to the College Conservatory of Music to\u000ahave a dialogue with composition major students. In what turned out to be a\u000amemorable session she talked in impeccable English of the recording experience\u000afor the film \u2018Gandhi\u2019, her association with Ravi Shankar, George Harrison and\u000aothers (just a day before the premiere of Shanti in Cincinnati in 2004).<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The human side of her was that of a full fledged Tamil speaking\u000agrandmother . She insisted on spoonfeeding my four-year old daughter Sukhita\u000aback in 2004. During Vinayaka Chaturthi in 2006, she served me kozhukkattais\u000ashe had personally made. She was full of warmth when our family visited her\u000ahome in 2008, when she introduced us to Sukanya Shankar and Ravi Shankar and\u000alater on followed up with us to see how our visit to Raviji\u2019s house went. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The childlike element in her was the most precious. I once\u000adropped her off at the Los Angeles airport and went to return a rented car\u000aprior to boarding my flight. I went to check on her well being in her terminal,\u000aknowing that there was a full hour left before her flight would depart. I\u000adidn\u2019t find her at the gate and was concerned. Soon enough I saw her saree clad\u000aoctogenarian form walking out of a nearby McDonalds; she gave me a mischievous\u000asmile as I noticed her smacking her lips - an ice cream cone in her hand!<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I had started writing this article a few months ago with the\u000aidea of sharing it with her before getting it published. When I spoke with her\u000ain early December she sounded unusually tired and even mentioned that she might\u000anot be around for too long. Despite this hint, it was a shock to hear that she\u000ahad breathed her last on 30th December 2013, the very day that&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Ramnarayan and I had had a conversation at the Music Academy canteen about her\u000aand the need to write this article as soon as possible. Her end came before I\u000afinished writing this.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">It is unfortunate that apart from Gowri Ramnarayan\u2019s article\u000aand another story in India West, the media has not marked her passing with an\u000aoutpouring of reports. It is also unfortunate that the Government of India has\u000anot honoured such a musical being with Padma and other awards. Lakshmi Shankar\u000adid not care about all that. She was beyond awards and recognition.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">What is the message from her that still resonates with me?</span></i></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">\u201cGod gives certain talents to some people; he also gives\u000athem the opportunity to do big things. One should never miss out on these\u000aopportunities\u201d.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Lakshmi Shankar\u2019s music lives through her recordings. I will\u000amiss speaking with her in a mixture of English and Tamil and her jokes in Hindi\u000aor Bengali, like one regarding the inadvertent presence of \u2018Shri\u2019 in\u000a\u2018Puryadhanashri\u2019 in the rendition of leading singers: \u2018Puryadhanashri mein\u000a\u2018Shri\u2019 hai na?\u2019 and above all her cheerful sprit and her warmth and blessings\u000aduring Vijaya Dasami each year.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
