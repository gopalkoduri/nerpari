In his hands the instrument came to life in an altogether enchanting manner, drawing comparisons from old-timers with past masters like Apa Jalgaonkar.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aKatti is a trained vocalist, according to Torvi, and it really showed in the sensitivity of his faithful responses to Torvi\u2019s masterly vocal phrases.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aStill, Vyasmurti Katti\u2019s exceptional musicianship cannot detract from the case against the suitability of the harmonium for Indian classical music.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAs I wait with bated breath for Kaivalya Kumar\u2019s concert today in the series, I shall be perfectly happy for my view to be challenged by yet another excellent harmonium performance.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aVinayak Torvi\u2019s performance was outstanding, with many listeners wishing the programme had been longer. The veteran was in excellent voice despite some trouble with the throat discernible early on. I shall not dwell on the details of the concert here as another correspondent is covering the festival for Sruti, but it went way beyond performance to communicate intensely, emotionally with the audience. After giving us a sweeping tour of the specialities of the Kirana gharana of which he is a leading light, he decided to offer us some samples of other gharanas as well, including the Gwalior gharana of his first guru.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GeJtrrz0vQE/T-vxG_x9-vI/AAAAAAAAApw/LC-6AMWtmhc/s1600/vyas2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GeJtrrz0vQE/T-vxG_x9-vI/AAAAAAAAApw/LC-6AMWtmhc/s1600/vyas2.jpg" /></a></div>Whether it was alapchari or taankari or tarana rendering, he was at all times not only deeply immersed in the spiritual dimensions of the music but also miraculously remained master of the situation. The interplay of rasas, hasya not excluded, that he managed to weave into the music at speeds from slow to fast, always in control, always in moderation, made the evening a magical one for a Chennai audience that has not heard Hindustani music of such a high order in quite a while.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aWhile speaking to the audience, Torvi recalled the warmth of earlier times, when the likes of Abdul Karim Khan interacted with Carnatic musicians, when the free exchanges included those of ragas that migrated from one to the other stream of \u201cBharatiya sangeet.\u201d He missed the affection between the musicians of those times. \u201cToday we may be staying on different floors of the same hotel but never meet, never attend each other\u2019s concerts.\u201d Listening to these words were a few more young Carnatic musicians in the audience than the previous day.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<div style="text-align: right;"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(<a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/essence-of-raga-music.html" target="_blank">To be continued</a>)</span></b> </div></div></div>
