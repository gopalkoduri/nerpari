On the first day they visited the famous Meenakshi temple where they had earlier put up the Grand Golu Durbar during the Navaratri festivities. On the second day they decided to visit the birthplace of M.S. Subbulakshmi. They were surprised that no one could guide them to the house. After an unrelenting search in the scorching sun they found a small house in the congested Hanumantharaya Lane. It was the birthplace of the legendary singer. None knew about it though it was situated only a stone\u2019s throw away from the west gopuram of the temple.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">The Trio was shocked to find a tailor\u2019s shop in the room where she was born. \u201cThere is no iota about her greatness to be seen anywhere, not even a nameboard or signboard in the vicinity, not a picture or photograph of MS inside the house,\u201d they cry in one voice. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">The only thing musical is a terracotta veena projecting from the facade of the building. We want to create awareness about the pathetic state of the house of the Queen of Melody. It should be made into a cultural landmark in Madurai.</div></div>
