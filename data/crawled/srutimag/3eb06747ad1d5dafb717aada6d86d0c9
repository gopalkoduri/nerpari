The ambience \u2013 the spacious hall tastefully and elegantly adorned with lamps brimming with flowers \u2013 seemed most fitting. The audience\u2019s curiosity to see, and hear, how such an abstract theme would be handled by a youngster was palpable. They were not disappointed. Ramakrishnan\u2019s selection of kritis, treatment and commitment were all reflective of his prowess.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">True to the theme, Ramakrishnan presented only four pieces over the course of two hours. He began with a short <i>slokam (Akhandamandalakaram),</i> followed by a Surati chauka-kala pada varnam in Rupaka talam, <i>Sami entani delupudura</i> by Subbarama Dikshitar. The sedate rendition brought out all the contours of the raga. This varnam was replete with archaic prayogas in Surati and brilliant swarakshara patterns for which the entire Dikshitar family is renowned. You\u2019d have thought this kind of composition was okay for yesteryear post-prandial tinnai listening, with <i>vetrilai pakku potti</i> to pep things up. No. The metro listeners gave their rapt attention to every nuance and detail, as Ramakrishnan made each line and phrase dovetail into the next one, maintaining continuity of raga and bhava.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">VVS Murari on the violin was the perfect foil, supporting the voice, and instrumental in that continuity. B. Sivaraman had trouble with the <i>sruti</i> alignment of his mridangam, which took its time to recover even after the airconditioning was adjusted to a lower temperature. However, he eventually overcame the problem.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">That brevity can also suggest expanse was proved by the sketch of Kedaram that followed. Muttuswami Dikshitar\u2019s intensely visual description of Lord Nataraja (<i>Anandanatana prakasam</i>) in his ethereal state performing the cosmic dance was then sung with complete commitment. Every line and every sangati were established firmly. The interesting nadai variation at the end of the <i>sollukattu</i> made us sit up and take note.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Instead of the usual <i>\u2018sangitavadyavinoda\u2019</i> line, <i>niraval</i> was aptly taken up at <i>bhukti mukti prada daharaaakaasam,</i> the sky a metaphor for the unending vastness that is the mind of the devotee. The raga Kedaram itself is rather limited in scope; yet Ramakrishnan brought out simple variations in the <i>niraval,</i> keeping the <i>sahitya bhava</i> intact. Both <i>niraval</i> and <i>kalpanaswaram</i> felt just right in terms of length. There was no artificial build-up of pace concluding in a crescendo. Everything fell in place with <i>poruttam,</i> a comprehensive whole.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">It had to be Bhairavi next. A one-minute teaser by vocalist and violinist whetted the listeners\u2019 appetite for a sumptuous rakti treat that was to come next. The detailed <i>alapana</i> was a grand build up of the majestic raga with some rare, unexpected <i>pidis.</i> VVS Murari\u2019s imagination flowed and blended with the whole. An all-too-brief <i>tanam</i> caused a flutter in the hall with knowing smiles suggesting a premonition of a <i>pallavi.</i> After all, Ramakrishnan was a disciple of the <i>pallavi</i> maestro, Chengalpattu Ranganathan.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">But Ramakrishnan chose to stump us all with Tyagaraja\u2019s <i>Chetulara.</i> This song, usually side-lined for instrumental performance in Pancharatnam congregations, made a refreshing comeback on the concert platform. Ramakrishnan\u2019s pathantara suddham and sincere rendition of the kriti were admirable. <i>Niraval</i> and <i>kalpanaswaras</i> at <i>Aani mutyaala konda vesi</i> were well-structured, measured and textured, with <i>raga bhava</i> and <i>sahitya bhava</i> again working in tandem. The <i>swarakshara prayogas</i> employed at the phrase <i>Parimala gandhamu</i> without fuss or seeming contrived.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sivaraman\u2019s <i>tani avartanam</i> was apt, with a just a few <i>avartanas</i> showing <i>nadai</i> variation, quickly concluding with the <i>mohra</i> and a <i>simple korvai.</i> There was peace and a sense of fulfilment at the end, no dramatics or sentimentality.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The mood was only heightened when Ramakrishnan took up MD Ramanathan\u2019s <i>Sagara sayana vibho</i> in Bageshri. The wave-like nature of the raga and kriti echoed, extended and carried forward the same idea of undulating expanse.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Bharatiyar\u2019s kavadichindu <i>Kaalamaam vanathil,</i> originally sung by MS Subbulakshmi to the tune of Kadayanallur S Venkataraman, was the final item. If at all one must nitpick it would be about the relatively diffident rendition of this song. Then again, that is hardly a grouse given how completely riveting the rest of the concert was.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Special mention of the Oli audience must be made here, especially in a concert with an experimental, abstract theme such as this one. Their willingness to <i>listen</i> (really listen) to the blossoming of ideas from the artists and their abstinence from breathless clapping even before a piece ended, were commendable. This audience allowed the artist to take his time as he meticulously overlaid ending phrases to finally converge, and the mridangist to complete the <i>arudi.</i> Each piece culminated in genuine applause, in the fullness of silence, without spoiling the mood.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The Concert:</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Slokam (Akhanda mandalakaram)</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sami ni entani \u2013 Surati \u2013 Rupaka \u2013 Subbarama Dikshitar</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ananda natana \u2013 Kedaram \u2013 Misra Chapu \u2013 Muttuswami Dikshitar</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Chetulara sringaramu \u2013 Bhairavi \u2013 Adi \u2013 Tyagaraja</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sagara sayana vibho \u2013 Bagesri \u2013 Adi \u2013 M D Ramanathan</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kalamam vanathil \u2013 Ragamalika \u2013 Tisra Adi \u2013 Subramania Bharatiyar</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RmwS9GaVnfs/T-AICd66sWI/AAAAAAAAAm8/3rqtcba55mI/s1600/rkm2.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RmwS9GaVnfs/T-AICd66sWI/AAAAAAAAAm8/3rqtcba55mI/s1600/rkm2.jpeg" /></a><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The Artistes:</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>Ramakrishnan Murthy</b> is an emerging star in the current crop of young musicians. A disciple of Padma Kutty in the USA, Ram went on to train under Delhi P Sunderrajan. He has also had the opportunity to learn from several other veterans including Chengalpattu Ranganathan. Ram\u2019s music is known for its maturity in content and execution and is high on laya and bhava aesthetics.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>VVS Murari</b> comes from a great musical lineage. He trained under his father </span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">VV Subrahmanyam and continues to perform duets with him. Murari who has imbibed a fine style of accompaniment is a pillar of support to the vocalist but also shines as a complete musician on his own.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>B Sivaraman</b> hails from a family of musicians. His father, Sethalapathy Balasubramanian was a foremost disciple of Papanasam Sivan. Sivaraman has trained under greats such as Kumbhakonam Rajappa Iyer and T K Murthy.

The glimpse of an unclouded sky\u2026 untiring waves of the ocean\u2026 unfurling fronds of an unfettered Bhairavi\u2026 never fail to take one\u2019s breath away.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The ever-fading horizon seen from across the vast ocean always evokes <i>adbhuta rasa</i> (awe) not merely owing to size but also because of the promise of inexhaustibility, limitlessness and freedom.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Saints and poets have addressed the mysticism and spirituality of space in several ways, be it, <i><b>bhavasaagaram</b></i> (ocean of existence), <i><b>daharaakasam</b></i> (all pervading ether), <i><b>viraat-purusha</b></i> (the primeval force), <b><i>viswarupa</i></b> (all encompassing form), <i><b>ananta-sayana</b></i> (unending trance).</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>Ezhandattu appaalan\u2026avan en kannulaan</b> \u201cHe who is beyond the seven universes is within my eyes.\u201d</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Great mystic poets have internalised the metaphoric significance of the cosmos and employed it beautifully in their works. Appar encapsulates the expanse that is his Siva-bhakti into a few words. Not an entirely dissimilar concept is a <i>cauka varnam,</i> where the grand gait of this Surati composition is contained within the deceptively brief rupaka talam.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><b><i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Bhukti mukti prada daharaakasam\u2026</span></i></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">What could be more vast and fertile than the human mind?
