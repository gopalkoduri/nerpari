Within a short span of time, he took us through the nuances of such compound ragas as Basant Bahar, Jog-Kauns, and Kausi Kanada. To my technically untrained ear, the beauty and power of the parent ragas as well as their offspring were more relevant than the science behind their formation. A stalwart contributor to Sruti, Deepak Raja repeatedly marvelled at the high degree of awareness of the Chennai audience and its willingness to bestir itself to attend learned lectures at 8 am.&nbsp; While he showed great poise in his elucidation of the nuances of the ragas, he became overcome with emotion while listening to a recording he played of Barodekar. \u201cThis exquisite recording brings tears to my eyes everytime I listen to it,\u201d he said.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aHe was also hugely impressed by the high level of attainment of the galaxy of musicians/ musicologists who had gathered at the Music Academy to listen to him. He also got a taste of the rare pleasure of listening to comments by members of the expert committee, when Prof. TR Subramaniam rose to repeat Ravikiran\u2019s comments, apparently not having heard the Chitravina maestro. (Ravikiran cited the example of the raga Ghanta as a compound of numerous ragas like Todi, Dhanyasi and so on, responding to Deepak Raja\u2019s question whether compounds of more than 4 or 5 ragas could hold their own as independent entities).</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aTRS also repeated a delightful anecdote he related last year after S Sowmya\u2019s lec-dem on the raga Ghanta.&nbsp; According to the story, TRS\u2019s coursemate at the Music College, Ramnad Krishnan once said that Ghanta was nothing but Dhanyasi sung imperfectly. To TRS\u2019s query on how to sing Dhanyasi wrongly, Krishnan gave a tongue-in-cheek reply again: \u201cIs it difficult for us musicians to get a raga wrong?\u201d<br />\u000a</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yp4qOYK6E24/Tu7np-e3b7I/AAAAAAAAAKk/YGgFW1t9Now/s1600/TN+Krishnan.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yp4qOYK6E24/Tu7np-e3b7I/AAAAAAAAAKk/YGgFW1t9Now/s200/TN+Krishnan.jpg" width="136" /></a></div>Octogenarian TN Krishnan took his time to warm up during the lec-dem that followed. He dismissed his childhood ability to effortlessly repeat on the violin anything his father-guru Narayana Iyer or other musicians threw at him, as of no great consequence, repeatedly stressing his lifelong quest for musical knowledge and perfection. \u201cI used to reproduce the Bhairavi varnam effortlessly when I was barely 4, but I am still unravelling it in all its dimensions.\u201d </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aKrishnan also attributed all his accomplishments as a musician to what he imbibed from great masters of the past like Ariyakudi, GNB and Semmangudi. Sure enough, his superb rendition of their varied singing styles and his own accompaniment to them brought tears of nostalgia to the audience.</div></div>
