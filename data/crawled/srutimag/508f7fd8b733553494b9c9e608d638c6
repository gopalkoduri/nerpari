He was very clear that he didn\u2019t want to be moved to a hospital, \u201cDon\u2019t prolong my existence needlessly.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aIn a room lit by a dull bulb in the far corner, Mani lay, with Shankar by his side. A blanket covered him from toe to eye; he held its edge across his nose with his hand. His eyes were open, as open as they could be, given his age and health. It was as if he wanted to see death; he didn\u2019t want it to take him away surreptitiously.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aWhat does a man think about when he knows he can do little for the rest of his brief stay? Does he comprehend the end? Or the journey? Does he think about what is in store for him after the end? Do these questions even bother such a man? Is he tired and does he just want to go? Shankar had seen his grandfather die a few years ago. That was a case where the mind wanted to live on, but the body wasn\u2019t up for the fight. Mani was the converse \u2013 he had made peace with his end, but his body, Shankar guessed, wanted one last skirmish.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aWas Mani ready to go? His eyes told little. Those steel grey eyes once twinkled with mischief, widened with excitement, softened with love. They always spoke a fraction of a second before he did. On that day, though, they just closed the world behind them. They turned into a cold, grey curtain. If there was something on Mani\u2019s mind, Shankar had no way of telling.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHe could feel Mani\u2019s fever from a foot away. When he stroked Mani\u2019s hair, he felt it burning. The hair was as grey as his eyes, but there was no sign of balding.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aWhen he was young, Mani\u2019s long hair framed his face, for he never tied it up. When he sang, the hair added layers to his interpretations. They patterned the raga with their whoops of joy. Then came a phase when he cropped, oiled and combed his hair in an elegant side-parting. The music in this phase was also a neat, well-oiled machine \u2013 his brilliance held in place by the boundaries of the concert format. It was almost <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music.html" target="_blank">Ariyakudi</a>-like \u2013revelling in the medium tempo, always trying something new, but never overdoing a piece of improvisation. It was an uncluttered presentation of cluttered ideas. His music hid its tricks behind an easy charm.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWe can drive down, if you feel up to it,\u201d Thanjan said, back in Kodaikanal, \u201cWe won\u2019t get a bus; it\u2019s a long weekend. Unless you want to rough it out.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhat car do you have?\u201d Ajith asked.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cA Gypsy.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cMani lived like a king in those days,\u201d Thanjan said, as the battered Gypsy made its way down the hills. \u201cI don\u2019t think he had all that much money, but he had enough people willing to spend on his behalf.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith smiled and peered at what little he could see of the road in anxious concentration as a lorry passed him dangerously up a hairpin bend.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI think he got tired of it, at some point. There was a string of affairs, your grandaunt being the only constant one. She was probably the only woman he really wanted to spend time with. His wife was a caring lady, fairly good-looking, but little else. Oh, she cooked really well. She brought up his children to hate him. You can\u2019t blame her for it, though. Mani didn\u2019t care much for them.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThat house was a delicate balance, you see. Srividya was fiercely protective of herself and her children, sometimes to the detriment of many people Mani cared for. Mani bore too much guilt for how he treated her to do anything about it!\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a</span><br />\u000a<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span></div><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aSadasivam tried to sleep, unsuccessfully, on a chair in the adjacent room. He couldn\u2019t bear to watch Mani\u2019s blank face and lost spirit. The phone rang. It was Narayanan.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHow\u2019s Appa?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cLast gasps.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re leaving tomorrow and coming there. If anything happens, don\u2019t wait for us for the cremation. We\u2019ll stay till the thirteenth day.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aSadasivam felt a surge of sympathy towards Srividya at the end of that phone call. She had spent the better part of her marriage shielding her children from their father\u2019s indiscretions. If she were a little more modern in her outlook, thought Sadasivam, she could have left Mani and sought a more independent, contended life \u2013 like Saraswathi, who chose to never marry.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"> </span> <br />\u000a<div style="text-align: center;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span></div><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThe best music I heard was not in Mani\u2019s house in his last years,\u201d Thanjan said. They had reached the plains now, and were proceeding a little less precariously towards Madras. \u201cIt was when Mani and Saraswathi sang together. They were geniuses, both of them. Saraswathi had an intuitive feel for the music, even more than Mani did. Her sense of rhythm\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen her keep talam with her hands or her feet. And I\u2019ve never seen her miss a beat. They listened to tapes of intricate tavil tani avartanams \u2013 Raghava Pillai, Meenakshisundaram Pillai and the like. Mani\u2019s eyebrows would knot in concentration. Not Sarasakka. And she would pause the tape, and repeat the <i>sollus</i> back to Mani as though she had been practising them all her life.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cTheir raga alapanas went on for days. Saraswathi was too weak to sing too much by this time. But they always sat down together. He would do the bulk of the singing, and she would join in every now and then with sangatis that she pulled out of nowhere. These last twenty years, he\u2019s been singing her music.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a</span><br />\u000a<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span></div><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cSing something,\u201d Mani mustered the energy to say to Shankar.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShankar thought for a moment, and started Purvikalyani. Mani immediately knew where he was going with this. He asked Shankar to stop with his hand; Mani always hated cliches. Shankar hummed Ritigowlai. Mani stopped him, and stage-whispered again. \u201cPoornashadjam!\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShankar was surprised at this strange raga request. But he obliged, softly singing <i>Lavanya Rama.</i></span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"> </span> <br />\u000a<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span></div><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHe was quite an alcoholic, you know,\u201d Thanjan said, \u201cHe would start with a drink every morning. A distant relative once received him at the airport in the US. Apparently, the first thing Mani asked for was some whiskey.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhen was this?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHmmm. This was when I was a kid - late seventies.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cBut I have heard a concert recording from that time. He didn\u2019t seem drunk or anything. Only his later recordings sound like there might have been something inducing his imagination.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThanjan sniggered. \u201cHe told me once, \u2018Thanju! There are these people who say alcohol stimulates the brain. That\u2019s rubbish. It numbs it. It makes you think you\u2019re producing great music! If anything, it gives you the courage to try something you might not otherwise. But then, at that stage, you lack the concentration to execute it.\u2019\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cBut later? Once he came back from Kodaikanal?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"> </span><br />\u000a<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br />\u000a</div><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"> After that second disappearance, the extremities of Mani\u2019s hair had declared independence from the rest of him. They refused to be tamed, forming violent swirls and intricate patterns, still retaining an odd coherence. He was often asked to oil and comb it, by his wife, but he liked it this way. Every now and then, he would be possessed by a doubt \u2013 of whether he really didn\u2019t care about his hair or whether he let it be as an act of defiance.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShankar stroked that hair now as he shifted to humming raga Saraswathi, almost unconsciously. He was holding Mani\u2019s hand; Shankar felt that it communicated this request to him. Shankar hummed a slow alapana around the dhaivatam, unleashing his teacher\u2019s trademark phrases that omitted the panchamam, and gave unnatural importance to the nishadam.</span><br />\u000a<div style="text-align: center;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span></div><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cSaraswathi\u2019s death shattered him?\u201d Ajith asked.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI used to think that, till recently. But I think it did more than shatter him.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith turned to Thanjan.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThe road,\u201d Thanjan reminded Ajith. He continued, once Ajith turned his attention to the road again, \u201cA year ago, I met Mani at his house. I had gone to Madras for my granduncle\u2019s funeral. My granduncle was quite a character, you know. My father got lucky when Mani left him the house. With his pension and the guesthouse, he lived very comfortably. My granduncle, on the other hand was only my father\u2019s age, worked his way up from the real bottom. He was a clerk in a lawyer\u2019s office in Madras. By the time he died, he was a lawyer, and a decent one at that. His sons, my uncles, a couple of whom were younger than me, formed a formidable partnership that rules the criminal courts to this day. Anyway, that\u2019s not the point of this story. I was telling Mani about him, and we got talking about death.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWatching someone die isn\u2019t easy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat morning, I spent three hours by her bedside, holding her hands, both of them in both of mine. We didn\u2019t know it would end then; it could have ended on any of the last nine days. Her hands had warmth, so did mine. We held, our grip tightening every now and then, and loosening again. It was like a game. When one of us felt a sudden eruption of love, we tightened, and when she lost energy, we slackened.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018After a while, we didn\u2019t know which hands were whose. They were equally warm; each knew every line, every depression, every lump, every fold, every groove in the other. They comprehended every move, every twitch, every squeeze. They were a part of the same system, feeding off each other, they had mingled with each other. Fevered warmth spread from her, through my hands, to the rest of me. From the chair, I moved to the space she made on the bed. Cheek against cheek, shoulder against shoulder, thigh against thigh and toe in toe, we lay, until the rest of each became as familiar with the other as the palms.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018I don\u2019t remember how long we lay like that. It could have been a few minutes or a few hours. We lost all sensation of time or place.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Slowly, the warmth left us. Death had come to take us away. We felt it in the tips of our toes first, then our knees, stomachs and cheeks. The tips of our fingers were last; death left us through there, taking one soul away and leaving only a shell of the other behind.\u2019\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aLiving in Mani\u2019s outhouse, and working as a clerk in the observatory, Thanjan\u2019s father, Govindan was the backbone of Mani\u2019s existence after Saraswathi\u2019s death. His wife cooked for Mani, kept the house clean, Govindan listened to his stories, his theories, his garbled philosophy.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani\u2019s already irregular, undisciplined existence had become even worse. The day had no meaning to him anymore, the sun had no effect on what he did or when he did it. Time floated, and he floated with it. Days went by and he didn\u2019t even know.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHe lived those months upside down, sleep and waking flowing in and out of each other, time completely diffused. Nothing made sense and nothing seemed to happen. He spent a week in bed, unwell, tended for by Govindan\u2019s family, and went on a drinking binge for four days with a couple of tea plantation owners, entertaining them with tales of his travels. He spent hours, late into the night, talking to Govindan about music, and spent days secluded and silent. He often sat in the sit-out staring at a tea plant.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHe spent hours tuning a tambura and listening to its drone silently. He seemed very distracted when he sang every now and then. The music came in spurts, it stopped and started. It had lost the verve it had. That didn\u2019t seem to frustrate Mani at all. He smirked, stopped singing and strummed the tambura with his eyes closed.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aEvery now and then, he would go on an interminable walk, ambling through clump hills, not too sure of where he was going or why. When he left on one of these walks, Govindan and his anxious family waited on him, cleaning the house, cooking every meal with a little extra for him. He returned, usually in a day or two, sometimes brisk and happy, sometimes tired and happy, and sometimes simply tired. Sometimes, he came back purposefully and sat with his tambura, and sometimes he just slept.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani asked Govindan once, \u201cYou know the day I took that crazy walk?\u201d Govindan remembered that day well.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aGovindan wedged his way around the thicket with a stout branch in one hand and a torch in the other. He wasn\u2019t sure if he would find Mani here, amongst these bushes. The hills had too many hideouts. Some people had seen Mani walking in this direction, and Mani had mentioned a stream he frequented in this area. Govindan, not familiar with these paths, found it almost impossible to search in the darkness. He had a local with him for help, but even he lost his bearings. The murmur of the stream led them to a spot where he saw a pair of legs sticking out from behind a rock.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThe body was cold, but there were faint signs of a beating heart. It took them four hours to get back to the road where they had left a jeep.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cFor days,\u201d Mani said, \u201cI had been hearing Saraswathi\u2019s voice, pleading with me to come to her. And then was another chorus of indistinct voices that welcomed me to wherever I was going. On each walk, I would hear these voices egging me on to walk farther till I reached them. Until that day, I was able to fight the chorus and return home.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThat night, when you took me to the doctor, I rose slowly from my body, I hovered above the scene, and the voices became more distinct, the chorus was more discernible. It was Saraswathi pleading with me to join her. My father, a mama from the drama company and Musiri were welcoming me. There was another voice \u2013 of a woman whom I only knew as Janani. I couldn\u2019t understand what she said at all.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cAnd then, something told me that it wasn\u2019t time to go. I don\u2019t know if I fought the voices, or if it was the doctor. I floated back to my own body, the voices stopped, I heard the hum of the machines in the hospital. When I become fully conscious later that day, I felt I was reborn after three months.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWere Janani and Saraswathi the same person?\u201d Ajith asked Thanjan.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThanjan smiled. \u201cMani doesn\u2019t know. When he first saw Saras Akka, he was sure they were the same. They looked identical, he said. But Akka always denied it.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhy did he leave Kodaikanal for the city again?\u201d Ajith asked.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cFor his wife. You know he used to say he performed only for his wife. That\u2019s a lie. He performed to keep her going financially. He performed out of guilt and not because he had any love for her. He retired when he didn\u2019t have to earn for her anymore.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a</span><br />\u000a<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span></span></div><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"> Shankar sang Ranjani now. He sang the pallavi of <i>Durmargachara.</i> Tyagaraja asks how people bring themselves to praise those who walked on sinful paths. Shankar sang it nearly in tears, for he remembered how Mani embellished each of the sangatis with intricate brigas and pregnant pauses.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani said, before closing his eyes, \u201cSuch a moralist, this <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja.</a> And such a genius!\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShankar felt the warmth leave Mani\u2019s hands. It dawned on him that those eyes wouldn\u2019t open again.</span><br />\u000a<div style="text-align: center;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span></div><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a<b>Epilogue</b></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith inserted the tape gingerly into his grandmother\u2019s old cassette player. The cover said, \u2018For Ajith\u2019. She sat on the easy chair a few feet away. Nethra and Thanjan sat on the edge of the bed, and Shankar stood by the player.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cTurn the record button on!\u201d a voice said through the player. Sharada recognised it as her cousin\u2019s.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cIt is on!\u201d Mani\u2019s voice said. Ajith was so used to hearing Mani\u2019s aged crackle that this seemed alien.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aA tambura filled the room now, in a booming one-kattai. Mani\u2019s voice came first, a sole chatusruti rishabham. The rishabham oscillated from almost the antaragandharam, but not quite there. It had a warmth, a life. It was not a swara taken in isolation, it was the raga\u2019s most distinctive feature. Soon, Saraswathi\u2019s voice sang a phrase, \u201cRi ga ma pa\u201d, gliding ever so smoothly, yet holding each note in its place for a fleeting second. Mani took over, as Saraswathi held the panchamam, \u201cRi pa ma ga ma ri.\u201d Each note was only an excuse for itself. The rishabham and the panchamam were conjoined by a drifting movement, the gandharam and the madhyamam were woven into each other. You couldn\u2019t tell them apart. The phrase stopped at the same rishabham where the alapana started.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThe two voices sang Sahana in this manner for almost half an hour, hovering around only four notes\u2014the ri, ga, ma and pa. It was the most thorough examination Sahana had received in years. The notes were put through the paces, they were bent, squeezed and turned, but they didn\u2019t break. Sahana\u2019s notorious gandharam, the one that\u2019s neither here, nor there, nor anywhere, revelled in its joyous dance. Saraswathi, as Thanjan had said, was a genius. She would interject with phrases of devilish simplicity and charm, and leave it to Mani to develop those ideas further. Her voice had a vibrant clarity about it, and its cleanness enhanced its ability to move.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith sat by the easy chair, holding his grandmother\u2019s hand. The music formed a vortex of images in her head, but the central one was the clearest. Of Saraswathi doling out sangati after sangati of dynamism with an unreal peace on her face. Of Mani sitting by her side, singing equally brilliantly, with the animated excitement of a seasoned performer. Mani\u2019s music grew on the concert stage, Saraswathi\u2019s in a dark room at the back of her house.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aOne side of the sixty-minute tape ended. The alapana had barely progressed beyond its first act. When Ajith changed the side, he found that the other side was blank. \u201cThey must have forgotten to change the side while recording,\u201d he said.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShankar, who had walked out in the middle to take a call, came back looking shocked.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Ajith asked.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cA lady called from some newspaper asking me if I wanted to place an advertisement in the paper for Sir\u2019s tenth day. I asked her how she got my number. She said, \u2018We go to the crematoriums, get numbers from there and do marketing.\u2019\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith stared in disbelief, so did Nethra. The silence was broken by a giggle from Sharada. Thanjan guffawed. Shankar joined in, and soon, the others.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHe would have found this funny, they knew.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"> </span> <br />\u000a<div style="text-align: right;"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Concluded)</span></b></div><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aDisclaimer: This is a work of fiction, with fictional characters.
