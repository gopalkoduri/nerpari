He was in his eighties, and though he suffered a stroke many years ago, seemed to be in reasonable health until yesterday, when he attended a concert featuring young vocalist Brinda Manickavasagam.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">A disciple of Musiri Subramania Iyer at the Government College of Music, Madras, he was an unabashed admirer of GN Balsubramaniam.</span></div>\u000a<br />\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">A great promoter of young talent, both through his Music Education Trust, and as a benign presence at many concerts featuring young artists, TRS (in his Tata Nano) was a familiar sight at concert venues all over Chennai. He was also a lively, sometimes iconoclastic participant in several lecture-demonstrations including the academic sessions at The Music Academy during the December season.&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<br />\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Sruti magazine was perhaps unduly harsh on the vidwan while publicising a controversial research thesis by one of his disciples s</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">everal years ago,</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">and it has been our endeavour in the recent past to undo some of the damage done by that expose. We in fact commissioned his profile for publication more than a year ago, in the hope that TRS would live to read it. After initial hesitation, he too happily agreed to cooperate with us. Unfortunately, the profile will now appear posthumously.&nbsp;</span></span></div>\u000a<br />\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Most musicians, critics, his legion of sishyas and mature music lovers believe that TR Subramanyam was a rare scholar, musician and teacher, a view that will be reflected in our tribute to him. A truly great loss to Carnatic music.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
