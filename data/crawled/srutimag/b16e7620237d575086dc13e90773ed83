Titled \u201cSlowly, Subtly, Invoking the Divine\u201d, the write-up by Alastair Macaulay set me thinking. His review is refreshing and provides interesting insights into a Westerner\u2019s perspective of solo Indian classical dance.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAccustomed as he is to watching ballerinas presenting solos which seldom last longer than two minutes, he finds the varnam \u201camazingly long and entirely enthralling\u201d. He has rightly pointed out that the full solo performance is a particular feature of traditional Indian dance. Watching even young classical debutants hold the stage for almost two hours, we do take such things for granted! He has mentioned how solo Bharatanatyam makes an impression as it becomes multifaceted through connections between the human and divine, alterations between abhinaya and nritta, and the subtle relationship between dance and music.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aMore interesting are the comments: \u201cBharatanatyam is keenly three-dimensional\u201d\u2026. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the body were hungry to face as many ways as possible at one time.\u201d The writer tells you why it seems so.
