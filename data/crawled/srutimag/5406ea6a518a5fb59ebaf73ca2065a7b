Srivaralakshmi, who wrote under the pseudonym Janani. The original, unfinished and untitled, was found amongst the author\u2019s papers after her death and translated into English by VasudevIyer and published in a collection of short fiction by women writers in Tamil.)</i></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">As high school girls in Neyveli, we were unabashedly romantic. Brought up on hopelessly mawkish mythology, drama and cinema, we believed that one day, a man would walk into our lives and change it forever. We would love him passionately, deeply, he would love us back; then we would bear his children, bring them up, care for them, get them married; we would weep when he dies, and he would if we died before him. Life taught us, however, that romances, marriages and relationships are far more complicated than that. When this story happened, though, I was only seventeen years and eight months old. Forgive me if I come across as a little naive.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">I remember only the strangest details from that summer afternoon. I wore an olive green sari with a darker green border. Don\u2019t mock my aesthetic sensibilities \u2013 my mother bought the sari for me. That day, she made my curd rice too milky; she overestimated the heat\u2019s curdling abilities. She also miscalculated the amount of time it would take for me to come from Neyveli to Thanjavur. I reached the station five hours before my train to Madras.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">When a train slowed down at the station, accompanied by its hoot, I noticed a pair of grey eyes. I looked away immediately, because I could feel their gaze on me, starting, like the hoot, at the far end of the platform, and continuing till that compartment curved out of eyeshot. I felt a little uneasy. Still, I wanted to see those eyes once more. For a second, I toyed with the idea of getting on the train and seeking those eyes. But I contained that desire. The train started moving.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">I don\u2019t know what forces pushed me to change my mind suddenly. Like they do in the movies, I stood up, picked up my bag and ran with the train until I caught up with the nearest door. I was about to leap into the compartment when I felt the gaze on me again. This time, it was from my left, from the platform. When I turned to meet the gaze, I saw those eyes adorning a six-foot-two-inch-frame, a handsome face, long, unkempt hair and the prettiest of beards. I froze. Those eyes looked unfazed, and that face broke into a faint smile.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">He asked me in a clear, young voice, \u201cLooking for me?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">I was flooded by another image \u2013 of a temple in Neyveli, gas lamps and a moonless night; of laughing faces, waving hands, swaying heads. I could hear the music again \u2013 that very same clear, young voice, its clarity and tone untarnished by the high notes or speeds it was trying to negotiate. I felt that high again, that meaningless rush of romantic love!</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">\u201cAre you who I think you are?\u201d I asked, nervously. He was.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">The train had left. The platform was deserted. There might have been a wind blowing, one of those comforting winds, or that might just be my romantic mind adding details to the event. I brought it to his notice that he had missed his train. He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know where it was going.\u201d I looked at him incredulously. He only grinned.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">\u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere?\u201d he asked.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">I considered that offer for a second, before asking, \u201cI know a place. Are you feeling up to a walk?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">He nodded, \u201cI have no plan, no schedule. My time is yours.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">\u201cYes?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">\u201cYour name?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">\u201cJanani.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">He liked my name, I think, for he repeated it with a certain fondness. \u201cI\u2019m Siva...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">\u201cI know.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">We first took a bus. I rested my head on his shoulder. I felt his initial uneasy excitement at my boldness, but soon he was comfortable, and leaned against me. We spoke a lot, of our families, of our friends, of childhoods, likes, peeves, idiosyncrasies, and music. He spoke of his music with a slight tinge of pomposity. He had the air of someone who believed he was the greatest, but wanted to hide this belief from the world. I spoke of my music nervously; I was only just above average.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">I asked him, \u201cWhat are you doing these days?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">\u201cYou\u2019ve ever heard of wandering musicians?\u201d I nodded. He said, \u201cI\u2019m not one. I\u2019m just a musician in hiding!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">I asked him what that meant. \u201cMy brothers are trying to get me married off to my neighbour. She\u2019s a sweet girl. But I can\u2019t live with someone who\u2019s just sweet, no?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you ran away?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">He paused for a moment, before he said, \u201cI was hoping I\u2019d run into someone like you.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">Our trek involved walking through paddy fields, a marsh, a clump and finally to the summit of a secluded hill. It led to a little settlement of no more than thirty families. It was almost ten in the night when we reached there - the entire journey had taken us six hours.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">He asked me again what we were doing there. I told him, again, to be patient.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">I led him to a house from which the most haunting Vagadeeswari ensued. We entered the little hall, where an old man was playing the veena, with his eyes closed while eight other men, two strumming tamburas, listened. The room was dingy, lit only by two large gas lamps. The windows were open, and faint moonlight made its way in, accompanied by a soothing wind. The artiste took no notice of our entrance.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">We sat at the back and soaked in the tanam. It was the slowest, most detailed, heavy tanam we had ever heard. The old man gave each swara such care and attention, they seemed to come alive. He played phrase after phrase around the rishabham, gandharam and the madhyamam, going back and forth, up and down, sliding and staccato, over each of those notes, slipping in and out of a rhythm. My grey-eyed hero watched in disbelief. His aesthetic sensibilities, his theatrical style were all being dismissed by an old, frail man on a veena. The entire room was in a trance when the veena began booming in the ati-mandra tanam. The old man played with an energy that belied his frame. Merging with his veena, he produced music that had the power of a thirty-piece orchestra. In that small space, one could hear the subtlest of the veena\u2019s tones, and the old man had much to convey through the faintest of touches, and the minutest of flourishes.&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">When the tanam ended, the old man fumbled for the glass of water that was behind him. His student, seated next to him, gave him the glass. Siva realised the man was blind. The man suddenly asked, \u201cJanani is here? At this hour?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">I never understood how he always sensed my presence. I replied, \u201cYes... I\u2019m with a friend. He sings.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">I could feel Siva\u2019s nervousness when the old man asked, \u201cSing for us? Is this sruti okay for you?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">Siva hummed a Todi phrase and said, \u201cYes. This sruti is perfect.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">The old man said, \u201cCan you sing Ritigowlai instead of Todi?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">Siva started with a striking tarasthayi phrase in Ritigowlai and started adding layer after layer of sangatis over it; like garlands. The old man exclaimed, \u201cBale!\u201d Siva\u2019s imagination was relentless - like cyclonic downpour! The little audience had never heard anything of that sort before. In ten minutes though, he was done. Exhausted by his own high, he was panting at the end of the alapana. He collected himself before launching into <i>Janani ninnuvina,</i> the grey eyes twinkling naughtily in my direction each time he said \u201cJanani\u201d. It was nearly midnight when his Ritigowlai ended.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">The old man asked us if we had eaten anything. We hadn\u2019t. Everyone in the hall walked with the man to a nearby house, where his sister fed us. When we were done, we settled down in the courtyard there. The old man tuned his veena and played a few notes. It was Ritigowlai, again. Siva, who was chatty, happy and proud, went silent. If his Ritigowlai rode on its sheer vitality, this one had pathos. Siva\u2019s was rough, even brash, this one was smooth and heavy. Siva snaked around the raga, like a young man on a motorbike through heavy traffic, the man drove along effortlessly, as if the traffic didn\u2019t exist at all.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace; font-size: small;">It was nearly sunrise when we were done with the music session. Siva didn\u2019t dare sing again that night. One of the men invited us to stay with him. When we walked towards his house, Siva pulled me by my hand into a bylane and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d Those grey eyes, in the early morning sun, moist, staring into my own, conveyed love and gratefulness in equal measure.<span style="font-size: x-large;"></span></span></div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ajith put the book down and s<span style="font-size: small;">aid to Nethra</span>, \u201cIt ends abruptly, but this is exactly the story Mani told me!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cStrange, I know. And of all the stories in the book, Vasudev Iyer chose to read this one at the launch. I was jumping with joy!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cYou spoke to him about it?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cYeah. So, Janani was a Bombay-based writer. She was in Neyveli until she got married to a civil servant. She would send short stories by post to a man in Madras she considered her editor, and he would get them published in magazines and newspapers. She died when she was 31, of tuberculosis.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ajith\u2019s face fell.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cI know what you are thinking. She\u2019s not your grand-aunt.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">That evening, Ajith sat on his balcony and heard the last part of the recording again, sipping a glass of whiskey.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cHow long were you in that village?\u201d Ajith asked.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cFor almost a month. We learnt from the old man, we sang with him, we sang for him. We stayed at his sister\u2019s house, where we were treated like her own children. We went on long, aimless walks. We sat silently for hours by a remote lake, just watching the ripples on the surface of the water. We were nearly married \u2013 I think she was pregnant at that time \u2013 when her family caught up with her. They took her away.\u201d Mani\u2019s voice trailed away at this point, and with a subtle movement of his fingers he indicated that she had been dragged away.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ajith asked, after a while, \u201cYou didn\u2019t go looking for her?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cI went to Neyveli,\u201d Mani replied, \u201cwhere she claimed to be from. No one there knew any Janani!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cYou never met her again?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cI am sure I did, although she pretended she was seeing me for the first time.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cWhen?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cAlmost twenty years later, at a wedding.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">That last statement confirmed it for Ajith. Janani could not have been his grand-aunt, although the woman Mani met fifteen years later probably was.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cThat\u2019s a story for another day. I\u2019m tired now,\u201d Mani said.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cWhen?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cI\u2019ll call you. I hope you will not publish these stories about women? I\u2019ll tell you enough about music. You can write about that.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ajith switched off his recorder, and continued sipping on his whiskey, occasionally killing a mosquito with his electric bat. He had an interview with Mani\u2019s student the next day \u2013 Raghavan, an elderly advocate in the High Court who was more Mani\u2019s friend than student.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">That night, when Shankar rolled out his mattress on the floor, next to his teacher\u2019s bed, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what Mani must have been like when he was younger. By the time Shankar met him, Mani was nearly seventy \u2013 he had just about retired, and Shankar thought of him as a musical sanyasi. He had never seen Mani talk about anything else with any passion or conviction. The rumour mill gossiped about Mani\u2019s indiscretions all the time, and Shankar had heard wild stories, but they seemed so unlike the Mani he knew that he simply disregarded them.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ajith\u2019s paati, Sarada, thought of her cousin endlessly that evening. The orphaned Saraswati and she were the only two girls amongst eight boys in her house. Growing up together, they were co-conspirators in everything they did (they were even named after the same goddess!), until Saraswati committed a crime that Sarada couldn\u2019t be a part of. It was a continuing crime that lasted for years, but Saraswati behaved as if she did no wrong.
