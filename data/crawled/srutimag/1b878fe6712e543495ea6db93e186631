Ganapathyraman, who played the mridangam for K. Gayatri\u2019s concert\u2014Oli\u2019s eleventh event\u2014said to her after the concert, \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was this Gayatri inside you!\u201d To be honest, we didn\u2019t either.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The theme for K. Gayatri\u2019s concert, classical ragas derived from folk music, presented her with an unusual challenge\u2014to maintain utmost classicism without losing sight of the inherent folksiness of these ragas. To say she rose to this challenge is an understatement; she owned the challenge and rose high above it. She expertly wove in the three anya swaras\u2014the striking antara gandharam, the subtle suddha dhaivatam and the earthy kakali nishadam\u2014derived from the raga\u2019s folk origins, into her Anandabhairavi alapana and still kept the raga within the classical boundaries that Dikshitar and Syama Sastry drew for it. She stitched swinging swara patterns around Kedaram\u2019s curves. She played with Maand\u2019s oddities (<i>Neerajadalanayana</i>), singing it, interestingly, in the main course section of the concert, almost as if she wanted to prove that it is no less classical than the Neelambari that preceded it.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">And what a Neelambari that was\u2014flowing, swaying, languorous, lilting\u2014striking at the heart of the raga to touch ours! In the alapana, it initially seemed like she spoke the raga\u2019s language in a rambling sort of way. But as it went along, and one phrase just seemed to flow from the other, as if each were the logical consequence of the previous, the rambling made full sense. Sometimes, there is beauty in formlessness. Sometimes, you perceive that beauty better when it is contrasted with form. The swaraprastaram for Dikshitar\u2019s <i>Amba Neelayatakshi</i> was a masterwork in resourcefulness and maturity. The sheer variety of swara combinations to come back to the sahityam, and the immaculate control over every one of these ideas without losing a sense of discovery or spontaneity, was simply astounding. Usha Rajagopalan, on the violin, matched Gayatri\u2019s round-for-round, playing with her ideas, inverting them, sometimes, feeding her new ones. It was a fascinating conversation.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CW8Mn_BYhYA/UAzS0mnejPI/AAAAAAAAAz0/cdeJl7qaYuw/s1600/gayacutcheri.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CW8Mn_BYhYA/UAzS0mnejPI/AAAAAAAAAz0/cdeJl7qaYuw/s1600/gayacutcheri.jpg" /></a><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Gayatri\u2019s swaraprastaram through the concert was consistently brilliant. She sang in various styles, from the fluent and brisk swaras for Kedaram and Kedaragowlai to the meandering and exploratory in the Neelambari, with the Anandabhairavi somewhere in between. Ganapathyraman\u2019s mridangam sang just like her, his anticipation, his finesse, his clarity of vision, taking each round of swara to new heights. She never lost sight of the lakshya of the raga or the lyrics in exercises in combinatorics or mathematics.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br />\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">That last aspect is what seems to set Gayatri apart from her peers\u2014she has a feel for the lyric, and an intuitive understanding of why a particular raga, or a particular phrase, suits a lyric. And this helps shape not only how she approaches a kriti, but also her manodharma, which she seems to see not as an aspect divorced from the kriti, but an ornamentation to it.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i>Andarama Soundaryam</i> in Kedaragowlai, the central piece, was a case in point. The raga alapana was oceanic, the phrases coming sometimes like relentless waves lashing against hard rock, or like the tranquillity of the deep sea. There were blistering brigas interspersed with stirring karvais. Her approach to the kriti was the same, drowning herself, and the audience, into the beauty of Rama. Ganapathyraman\u2019s tani built on Gayatri\u2019s energy, lacing rhythmic threads into lovely little knots. It ended unexpectedly, however, without the usual mora and main korvai\u2013even Gayatri and Usha were taken by surprise. Usha\u2019s violin was still by her side!</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">This concert was amongst the best in this Oli series. It had feel, it had scholarship. It was pensive here and there, it was joyous elsewhere. It had calm, in oodles, and when required, it had fireworks as well. It had the musicians looking within themselves, and it still had them performing for the audience. It was classical, very classical, yet it was a tribute to folk.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ix9ozNJHFY8/UAzR5lcwMNI/AAAAAAAAAzs/XYOKkD2Jc8I/s1600/gayatri+k.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ix9ozNJHFY8/UAzR5lcwMNI/AAAAAAAAAzs/XYOKkD2Jc8I/s1600/gayatri+k.jpg" /></a><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The concert</span></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Slokam followed by kriti - Kedaram - Adi - Ramaswamy Sivan</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kaalai thookki- Yadukulakambhoji - Adi - Marimuttha Pillai </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Paradevi - Anandabhairavi- Rupakam - Nilakantha Sivan</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Amba Neelayataakshi- Nilambari - Adi - Dikshithar</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Neerajadalanayana - Maand - Adi - M.Sambasiva iyer</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Andarama soundaryam - Kedaragowla - Adi - Arunachalakavi</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Kanakasailaviharini - Punnagavarali - Misrachapu - Syama Sastry </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Manjunigar- Kavadichindu</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sri Venugopalam - Kurinji - Khanda Eka - Muthuswamy Dikshitar</span></div></div>
