However, I guess the close association of the other two songs with the Freedom Struggle scored points.&nbsp; Don\u2019t know if the song is still played at school flag hoistings (or, for that matter if kids just sleep in on August 15th these days instead of marching off to school at dawn on August 15th as we used tio).&nbsp; Better still, they maybe Skype-ing the whole function -J) It was only much after GNB had passed away that I got to appreciate the rest of his music.&nbsp; I remember his songs from the movie \u2018Sakuntalai\u2019 with MS, and, later on I heard Himagiri tanaye which is my second top pick for GNB. The words \u2018Himagiri tanaye\u2019 conjure up for me an image of a beautiful child playing on the slopes of her father\u2019s home, the Himalayas, and, all that is associated in that wonderful archetypal father-daughter relationship... and GNB\u2019s rendering of the song brings out the wonder of a true devotee singing.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HtY5vXAQziw/TwqvmzEyyTI/AAAAAAAAAPw/SDd1DxY6jtw/s1600/gnb.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HtY5vXAQziw/TwqvmzEyyTI/AAAAAAAAAPw/SDd1DxY6jtw/s1600/gnb.jpg" /></a></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.hummaa.com/player/player.php">http://www.hummaa.com/player/player.php</a><br />\u000a<br />\u000aUnfortunately, I never got to listen to GNB sing live.&nbsp; He passed away in 1965, far too prematurely. And, in 1965, I was interested in other things that interest teenage boys.&nbsp; Later on, as I got to listen to recordings of GNB, I was fascinated and always wondered what was it that made his singing so attractive (am listening to Ananda Natesa as I write this).&nbsp; Was it the depth of his voice? Was it just the man? He was tremendously good looking and had set many a female heart a-flutter in his days\u2026What was it that made his music so unique?&nbsp; And, this morning when I was working out on my elliptical machine listening to GNB through the head phones the phrase \u2018passionate detachment\u2019 came to my mind\u2026<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Yes\u2026that was it\u2026he practised passionate detachment\u2026he could immerse himself so totally in the song and its meaning, and, yet remain detached\u2026the true quality of a Rajarishi\u2026the words attributed to King Janaka come to mind<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Anantam iva vittam me, naasti me kinchana<br />\u000aMithilayam pradeeptayam na me kinchana dahyate<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">(All the wealth of the Universe is mine, yet, there is nothing that is mine<br />\u000aShould the whole of Mithila be destroyed, nothing that is mine would be destroyed)<br />\u000a<br />\u000aYes, if Janaka could sing he would have been born as GNB.</div></div>
