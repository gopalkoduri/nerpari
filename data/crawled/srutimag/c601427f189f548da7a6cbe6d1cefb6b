There was a sensitive exposition of Khamas, and a wonderful Sama kriti in Varuvaro by Gopalakrishna Bharati.<br /><br />Suguna repeatedly spoke of Musiri\u2019s bhakti for Tyagaraja, taking the audience on a glimpse of the utsava sampradaya in the process. Her own bhakti for Musiri was much in evidence. She was able to laugh at her own and her peers\u2019 inadequacies and the great patience the guru showed them. Never one to utter a sharp word, Musiri restricted criticism to smiling admonition of the multitude of angularities in the students\u2019 interpretation of his lessons (Ellame konal\u2026etc.) No note-taking was allowed in class, and tape recorders were a rarity (\u201cTK Govinda Rao flashed one around after a trip to Singapore\u201d; this with a mischievous twinkle in her eye). You repeated after the guru as he took you through whole kritis in each class until you got it right. <br /><br />If niraval was Musiri\u2019s speciality, so was his own unique brand of swara prastara, with short phrases falling seamlessly in place with the raga bhava fully intact. In fact, bhava, as we all know was his USP, though selling anything was the last thing on his mind, we gathered from Suguna Mami\u2019s emotion-surcharged homage to a great teacher and vidwan. If the small number of sahrdayas present were a privileged lot, those who missed out perhaps because of competing programmes in the city, were really unfortunate. Hopefully, the audio recording will provide solace. Watch this space.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
