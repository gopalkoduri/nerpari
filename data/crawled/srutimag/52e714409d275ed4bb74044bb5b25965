Srikantan in January 2014. The unabridged version will appear in the March 2014 issue of Sruti)</b><br /><br /><i>Vidwan R.K. Srikantan was one of the oldest masters of classical music.&nbsp; He continued to perform like no other at a ripe age. He was a predominantly self-made artist in an art that requires training from a guru for a long period, and he has passed on the art to numerous disciples who have made a name for themselves. <br /><br />Just before his concert at the Music Academy, this nonagenarian was playing an imaginary tic-tac-toe on the ground with his walking stick, as he waited for his retinue to arrive. It was indeed very inspiring to meet Sangita Kalanidhi Dr. R.K. Srikantan, a Padma Bhushan awardee, and to learn about his long career as a musician, a few days before his 94th&nbsp; birthday on 14 January.</i><br /><br /><b>Please tell us about your initial days as a performing musician.</b><br /><br />I attended numerous concerts of the great masters of those days like <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music.html" target="_blank">Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar,</a> <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_14.html" target="_blank">Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer,</a> Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar, Palghat Rama Bhagavatar, Venuswami Pillai, Tavil <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2013/10/needamangalam-meenakshisundaram-pillai.html" target="_blank">Meenakshisundaram Pillai</a> in Bangalore and also in Chennai where my brother lived. That gave me the inspiration to take up music as a career and earn the vidwat and gauravam that these musicians made for themselves. I sat through these concerts with eyes closed and tried to reproduce all the nuances that I heard. I was eager to imbibe the good in all the styles and also weed out anything that was not required. I was also keen to take criticism in the right spirit.<br /><br /><b>You were well educated. Why did you choose to take up music as your career?</b><br /><br />After my Bachelors, I enrolled for a Masters in history. But I could not&nbsp; continue as my musical leaning got stronger. My brother <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music.html" target="_blank">R.K. Venkatrama Sastry,</a> was very keen on making me a good vidwan. My father, who was a scholar and a Harikatha exponent, was also adept in music. There was enough music around to ensure I was inspired and engaged by music all the time.<br /><br /><b>To achieve this kind of mastery of the ragas and laya aspects of music, you must have had a rigorous sadhakam schedule? </b><br /><br />Yes. It is only by hard work that you can achieve great heights. I did severe sadhakam those days, singing varnams in four kalams, and specific sadhakam for sustaining the sruti. I would take up one raga and improvise, work on my manodharma for one whole month and practise all the compositions in that raga. A good artist is made of 25% marga darsanam of the gurus and 75% sadhakam.<br /><br /><b>How do you maintain your voice the way it is. It is remarkable that even now it is steady and reverberating, with no trace of ageing.</b><br /><br />Although a voice is God-given, you have to make special effort to maintain it. You must eat satvika food; say no to spicy food. Also it is important to talk less, specially when you have concerts. I have always ensured a gap of at least one week between two concerts. This is required to rest the voice and to avoid repetitions in kalpana sangeetam.<br /><br /><b>Do you think the current generation can relate to tradition and bhakti in music?</b><br /><br />Yes of course. Teachers should inculcate these along with the music, just as parents teach devotion to their children. This is as important as providing them with food and other necessities.<br /><br /><b>What do you feel about introducing complexities in concerts, like singing vivadi scales and complex laya exercises in pallavis?</b><br /><br />I believe you should be aware of all the theoretical nuances and laya intricacies so that you can prove yourself if challenged. But otherwise, it is not necessary to indulge in these things, as too much of these complexities will rob the concert of its <i>ranjakatvam,</i> the <i>rakti gunam</i> will be gone. Even Venkatamakhi has acknowledged this. Bliss or <i>ananda</i> can never be achieved if we indulge in such practices. It is, however, good to be able to perform these for the sake of knowledge.<br /><br /><b>What do you have to say about the December season and its growing&nbsp; popularity?</b><br /><br />It is definitely good for music. More people attend concerts, more students learn \u2013 from India and abroad. More and more music festivals are hosted; the Cleveland festival has gained so much in its popularity. <br /><br /><b>Your tryst with Haridasa compositions?</b><br /><br />My employment with AIR gave me the opportunity to come across a lot of these beautiful compositions. I was in service for 32 years. I was inspired to tune them and make them concert items and popularise them.. Their devotional and philosophical content is very deep.<br /><b><br />But you seldom sing Tamil compositions even during concerts in Chennai.</b><br /><br /><i>\u201cNaanum Tamizh daan ma\u201d.</i> My ancestors were originally from Senkottai in Tanjavur, and they migrated to Karnataka about a thousand years ago. My bani is also predominantly based on the Tanjavur gamaka oriented style. I used to sing a lot of Tamil songs as main items and as tukkadas during my earlier days, but later, people requested for these songs after the main song. I sing a lot of these Devarnamas. I do like a lot of Tamil compositions. <i>Eppo varuvaro</i> is one of my favourites. I have even set a Devarnama to a similar tune in Jonpuri inspired by this song.<br /><br /><b>What is your advice to young musicians on planning concerts?</b><br /><br />It is important to be disciplined. Freedom with restraint is what is required. The concert list has to be prepared at least one week in advance, with variety in composers, ragas, talas and tempo. Also, it is important to have a pleasant rapport with the accompanists and encourage them.&nbsp; Musicians must maintain a positive outlook even while dealing with some organisers who act petty or do not extend reasonable hospitality. I maintain a gauravam and, without one bit of ego, try to let them know. It is important to maintain a nice attitude. I believe the personality of a musician is reflected in his or her music.<br /><br /><b>You have won many prestigious awards and titles including the Padma Bhushan for your contribution to music. You are largely responsible for creating a special place for Karnataka in Carnatic music.</b><br /><br />I consider the appreciation of vidwans to be the greatest of all awards.&nbsp; Many great vidwans have appreciated my music; all senior violin and mridanga vidwans have accompanied me in concerts. Once at Bharat Kalachar, after my concert, <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">Umayalpuram Sivaraman</a> spoke about the concert when he said it was his great fortune (bhagyam) to have accompanied me in the concert. I consider it very special and will cherish it forever. I am very fortunate to have such a family. My wife and children have been very cooperative and extended full support to me. I only pray that I keep singing as long as I live.<br /><br /><b>(Aishwarya Srinivas, a Carnatic vocalist, was RK Srikantan's disciple)</b></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
