It was through this route that Indian musicians started playing western instruments, first as members of western music orchestras or bands, and later as innovators who borrowed some of these instruments such as the violin and the clarionet for use in Indian music.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Baluswami Dikshitar (1786 \u2013 1859), musician, scholar, composer and a brother of the great vaggeyakara Muthuswami Dikshitar, introduced the western violin to Carnatic music, learning it from a European.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Baluswami Dikshitar, who could also play the veena, sitar and mridangam, adapted the violin to the Carnatic style, playing it seated on the floor, cross-legged and cradling it between his ankle and chin. That it could produce the nuances of gamakas, the continuity across microtones that distinguishes Carnatic music from other forms, encouraged Dikshitar, and generations of musicians after him to invest a western instrument in concept and construction a distinctly Indian character.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The Carnatic violin, like other Carnatic stringed instruments, applies modal tuning that changes with the pitch (sruti) that is constant for a concert. The strings are tuned to the panchamam and the shadjam and their lower-octave counterparts.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">By the end of the 19th century, the violin had become the prime instrument accompanying vocal music in a concert. It continues to be so. With the arrival of the next generation of violin virtuosos in the early 20th century \u2013 Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu, Tirukkodikaval Krishna Iyer and T. Chowdiah, to name a few \u2013the violin, or fiddle as most musicians here used to call it, also began to make its presence felt as a solo instrument.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XOytRpsjo8c/T-Lz6EfUttI/AAAAAAAAAoE/GzmjCLt1SAY/s1600/Lalgudi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XOytRpsjo8c/T-Lz6EfUttI/AAAAAAAAAoE/GzmjCLt1SAY/s320/Lalgudi.jpg" width="229" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The quite amazing violin techniques in vogue today\u2014in particular that of playing it to closely resemble the human voice (the gayaki style of violin playing) as opposed to the earlier manner of playing relatively discrete notes\u2014were largely developed by the great artists of the 20th century, at least three of whom are still with us: T.N. Krishnan, Lalgudi G. Jayaraman, and M.S. Gopalakrishnan. They are musicians of contrasting styles and temperaments, but all of them are of the highest calibre and pedigree.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">T.N. Krishnan, a child prodigy, learnt his art from his father Tripunitura Narayana Iyer, a martinet of a teacher. Krishnan\u2019s talent was burnished by long association with the great vocal masters of the era. He is known for his ability to present the most complex nuances of Carnatic music with disarming simplicity, and his strong bowing technique that produces ringing clarity and purity of sound.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Lalgudi G. Jayaraman, musician, teacher and composer par excellence, is another violin great of impeccable pedigree. The son of Lalgudi Gopala Iyer, a masterful figure of his time, for whom music was a mission, he built on his father\u2019s meticulous, regimented training, through the perfection of his own quite extraordinary creative instincts. The perfect accompanist of his era, Lalgudi in time developed an altogether more flowing, lilting style.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VGLi8rpWG_Q/T-L0DaqgFsI/AAAAAAAAAoM/fB_9WpNHwM8/s1600/MSG.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VGLi8rpWG_Q/T-L0DaqgFsI/AAAAAAAAAoM/fB_9WpNHwM8/s320/MSG.jpg" width="254" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">M.S. Gopalakrishnan, legatee of yet another violin tradition handed down from father to son, is proficient in both Carnatic and Hindustani music. He too learnt his art from a strict guru who was also his father. Parur Sundaram Iyer was an extraordinary pathbreaker who introduced the violin to Hindustani music. MSG is known to play long passages on the same string, essaying intricate passages of beauty with accuracy.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Senior violinists like M. Chandrasekharan and V.V. Subrahmanyan have built upon these techniques to evolve their own styles.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The Carnatic violin continues to evolve, with its electric counterpart and a double-headed version making appearances at classical concerts. Contact microphones are changing the way the violin sounds.</span><br style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" /></div></div>
