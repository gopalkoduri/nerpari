She was twelve then and he 19 or 20. She remembers, \u201cHe was with Dada (Uday Shankar) in his troupe and even then he would compose little songs and make us all sing. As a dancer he was simply fantastic, which is why he was able to make so many memorable ballets. He knew every little step. I was fascinated by his music, his dance, his way of putting things. I was one of the dancers in the troupe too at the time. We did two tours then all over the country. I was the baby of the troupe \u2013 Dada selected me as the best dancer among 60 girls.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cAfter Raviji went to Maihar, he came to Almora once in a while and even participated in the tours. After some years I lost touch totally, except for seeing him in his concerts in Bombay. I got married and everything changed.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cI then met him in 1959-60. My husband Amiya Chakrabarty had made the Hindi film <i>Seema</i> for which he won five national awards posthumously. (<i>Daag</i> starring Dilip-Nimmi, <i>Patita</i> with Dev Anand and Usha Kiran \u2013 were also great hits he directed. All of them had music by Shankar Jaikishen). Raviji saw my photograph and the news of my husband\u2019s death in the <i>Illustrated Weekly</i> in London, and sent me a condolence message \u2013 he keeps in touch with people despite all his schedules. Our contact was revived when he came back to India. As my sister happened to be his sister-in-law, we met at family reunions.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Kamala accompanied Ravi Shankar on a 13-month tour all over the world in 1967 \u2013 Europe, the U.S., Russia and Japan, playing the tambura for him. She was a constant companion and came to learn the amazing range of Ravi Shankar\u2019s music.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Subsequently she was with him for almost 24 years, travelling with him, anticipating his needs and attending to them. A perfectionist to the core \u2013 he went through the minutest detail from rehearsal to final programme. He made no compromises \u2013 every item had to be rehearsed meticulously. \u201cI can sing a bit though I\u2019m not a professional singer. He taught me many compositions but I had a handicap \u2013 I couldn\u2019t write notation, unlike Lakshmi Akka. I had to be taught the whole thing. It would be a part of the daily routine, almost \u2013 he would be singing, I\u2019d be cooking or making tea and ask him to sing louder. But this way I learnt a great many compositions of his.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Performing or traveling with Ravi Shankar exposed the team to so many facets of his personality including his sense of humour. One scene in the ballet <i>Labour and Machinery,</i> portrayed the confusion of the common man \u2013 whether to take to machinery and adopt it as a way of life, or to stick to farm labour. In that scene, all the actors were supposed to shout meaningless syllables vaguely and aimlessly. They were directed to go round and round on the stage mumbling, shouting. The idea was to convey the confusion. Raviji would say \u201cDosai rendu, onnu murugal, onnu saada!\u201d (Two dosa-s, one roasted, one plain!). The cast would start laughing, but he kept repeating his chant with a straight face.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />There were several instances of how seriously Ravi Shankar took his role of propagator of Indian classical music. He once performed at Omea, a very small town in Rotterberg, Switzerland, which the musicians reached by ferry. It was a mini-concert of about 90 minutes. It was terribly cold, Alla Rakha and Ravi Shankar were both freezing and wondering how they were going to play their instruments. The organisers offered some brandy to warm up, but Ravi Shankar demurred, naturally. Somehow, battling the cold, he played a superb Charukesi. The organisers did not arrange any food for the party, and when they returned to the hotel, they found nothing to eat, not even water to drink. The restaurants closed at seven. Alla Rakha was literally in tears \u2013 he could never withstand hunger pangs. Ravi Shankar sat quiet, apparently lost in deep thought. Upset by his demeanour, Alla Rakha demanded to know, \u201cWhat\u2019s this? We\u2019re stuck in this godforsaken place with no food or drink. What are we going to do?\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Ravi Shankar\u2019s response was typical of the maestro: \u201cI feel neither hunger nor thirst. All I know and am happy about is, we\u2019ve brought Indian music to such a remote place, made quite a few people sit through and enjoy our music in the biting cold. That\u2019s enough reward for all the suffering.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />On another occasion, Ravi Shankar\u2019s troupe returned from a concert to the hotel and found there was no power. They had to climb the stairs to their room on the fourteenth floor. All of them had heavy luggage \u2013 sitar, tanpura, tabla and so on. Ravi Shankar walked briskly up as if it was a simple, natural thing to do. The rest of them were trudging along far behind, painfully and slowly. Around the tenth floor, a couple of them sat down, unable to walk any further. Ravi Shankar went up, opened the room and tried to egg them on to finish the climb. When that failed, he came down four floors, took two tabla-s and went up, came down again and took the tanpura, and finally one more time to fetch his colleagues! When they started walking back, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t you realise what a great thing we\u2019ve done? We are in Rio de Janeiro, exhibiting our music to the Brazilians and making them love it. It\u2019s no small feat. Be happy and think of that. All our troubles are minor. We\u2019re taking our music to every nook and corner of the world. Nothing else matters.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />In his mature years, Ravi Shankar became quite an addict of television serials. He usually slotted the time for different items in his concerts so that the curtain could come down precisely at the end of the allotted time. In one concert, however, every item was going faster \u2013 each finished with a few minutes to spare. The concert was supposed to be till 8.30 but he was through by 7.45 pm. It was the day of <i>Mission Impossible,</i> a serial he loved. As soon as the curtain came down, he snapped, \u201cCome, come, we\u2019ve got to rush. We\u2019ll be just in time for the programme.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Hemangana\u2019 \u2013 the house of his dreams \u2013 was built in Varanasi in 1973-74. It was called RIMPA, the Ravi Shankar Institute of Music and Performing Arts. Every year 20 to 25 students from all over India would assemble there. There would be teaching sessions morning and afternoon. Evening and night would be time for fun and games. And music. Ravi Shankar taught the students through many media \u2013 including these games. The next morning, he would be a different person \u2013 a hard taskmaster, very demanding, a perfectionist. \u201cIs this the man who laughed and joked with us last night?\u201d the students used to wonder.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Ravi Shankar held festivals there. For five days, eminent musicians and dancers assembled there every year and performed. Ravi Shankar played on the last day.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The concept of Hemangana was something like the gurukula system, but it did not last beyond three years. It needed the guru to be in one place and the sishya-s to be with him throughout. Ravi Shankar could never be bound to one place. He was always on the move. \u201cIf he comes to a place and stays even for a week he gets fidgety and says \u2018Chalo let us go to Bangalore\u2019, Kamala said. And at Bangalore after a few days, he\u2019d say, \u2018Come, we\u2019re off to Calcutta\u2019.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The atmosphere of Hemangana was fabulous. Satyajit Ray said, \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced anything so Indian.\u201d There were student quarters, beautiful orchards, arches. Attention was paid to every little thing.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Janardan Mitta, whom Ravi Shankar once described as \u201cmy favourite student\u201d, was born into a musically inclined family. His father Mitta Lakshminarasiah, was a leading lawyer of Hyderabad. Keen on music, the senior Mitta would come home on Thursdays (Friday was a holiday in the Nizam\u2019s Hyderabad) and close his office for the weekend, to play the tabla or the harmonium and sing with his wife and six children for an audience. \u201cVakil sahib\u2019s\u201d home was the gateway to the twin cities for most visiting musicians.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Janardan, who joined the film industry in Madras back in 1956 and became a permanent fixture as a sitarist in films made here for over four decades, picked up his sister\u2019s sitar once she left home after marriage. By 1952, he had successfully auditioned before stalwarts Pandit Ratanjankar and Veerendra Kishore and started playing for Deccan Radio. He first heard Ravi Shankar live in 1955, when he came to Hyderabad for a Sangeet Sammelan concert. Janardan had completed his M.A. and was now doing his second year in engineering, but was dying to take up music full time. His father said he had six sons and so didn\u2019t mind one of them taking to music. He took Janardan to meet Ravi Shankar. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d was Ravi Shankar\u2019s response when Lakshminarasiah said he would take Janardan out of engineering college if Ravi Shankar would take him as a disciple.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Ravi Shankar came to Hyderabad again in 1956, and this time he did listen to the young sitarist. He said, \u201cYou seem to know some of the advanced things without knowing the basics.\u201d He appreciated the way Janardan played the raga, the taan and the meend, but corrected a basic mistake he was making in the number of front and back strokes. \u201cThat\u2019s why I need a Guruji,\u201d the young man shot back in all innocence. Ravi Shankar asked him to apply for a government scholarship, but though he did not get it, Janardan still went to Delhi in 1956 to learn from Ravi Shankar. It was a busy year for Ravi Shankar. He had just quit the AIR job and become a full time musician. That year he travelled to Afghanistan for the first time on a concert tour. \u201cWhenever he found time to teach us in the midst of his travels, he opened a treasure box,\u201d Janardan remembers.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Janardan was one of the students to take part in the annual camp in Benares. Kartik Kumar, Shamim Ahmed, Rama Rao and Arun Bharat Ram were some of the others. At the classes, Ravi Shankar was a strict disciplinarian. \u201cHe was never satisfied until you got every nuance right,\u201d he said. \u201cOutside the classroom, he was a friend, mixing freely with everyone. At Benares, we always had lunch with him. \u2018Today, we have an apology for sambar,\u2019 he would apologise. In the evening, we were free to go where we chose, but sometimes he would accompany us on outings, taking a childlike pleasure in simple things. He took us on boat rides to watch the sunset, even liked to go to movies. Once after a concert in Chennai, he said, \u2018Let\u2019s go to <i>Bobby</i>\u2019, referring to the Hindi superhit film of the 1970s.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cGuruji had been trained in the tough school of Ustad Alauddin Khan. He taught him dhrupad, the surbahar, complicated tala-s. It was Guruji who reintroduced the complex laya techniques of Carnatic music like tisra nadai and khanda nadai to Hindustani music, which had lost them over time. Even last year, he played a composition set to a tala of 10.5 beats at a Hyderabad concert. Every Sunday for a whole year, he presented a programme of \u2018aparichit\u2019 or new raga-s, 52 different raga-s.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Janardan has the greatest respect for Ravi Shankar\u2019s intellect. \u201cFor instance, Guruji had an original explanation for the relative simplicity of laya in Hindustani music. In the north, we sang for the king, while musicians sang for God in the south. At the temple, they sang without inhibition, exploring the entire range of raga and tala, with no fear of displeasing their compassionate God. But in the durbar, you did not dare to go beyond teen taal for fear of offending the king who would not then know how to keep the beat along with you.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Ravi Shankar\u2019s respect for Carnatic music and musicians is well known. \u201cHe still keeps track of what\u2019s happening here,\u201d says Janardan. \u201cHe keenly watches the careers of young musicians like T.M. Krishna, Vijay Siva and Sanjay Subrahmanyan.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<div style="text-align: right;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Concluded)</span></b> </span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a</div>\u000a
