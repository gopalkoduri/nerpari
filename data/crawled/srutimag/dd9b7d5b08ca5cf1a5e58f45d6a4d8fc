A mridanga vidwan, Akshay is happy to declare that his tutelage under his guru TH Subhash Chandran in the USA has been in the <i>gurukula</i> system. Apart from playing the mridangam, Akshay is also known to many as a talented khanjira and konnakol artist.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Akshay spoke to Sushma Somasekharan. Excerpts:</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>Akshay, what does being a musician mean to you?</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I define myself as a performer, traditionalist and innovator. Being a mridangam, khanjira and konnakol artist in New York has given me the opportunity to perform with artists from varied genres. As a traditionalist, I am a Carnatic musician adhering to conventional practices and methods. The innovator in me explores new opportunities and conceives new ideas in both the Carnatic art form and other areas.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>Why did you move to Chennai?</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />One of the main reasons behind moving to Chennai was to perform with more local musicians. In my opinion, however talented you may be, you can only be regarded as a successful Carnatic musician if you establish yourself in Chennai.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Also I wanted to be exposed to music at all times and Chennai was the best place for that to happen. I did not want music to be a weekend affair anymore. It is an enriching experience to listen to live concerts here, observe what the audience is looking for and how the senior artists package their concerts to cater to their tastes. I have been here for less than a year, but I can tell that I have improved tremendously from just being in this music environment.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>You have performed with artists from various backgrounds. How popular are our Carnatic percussion instruments on the global front?</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I feel there is not sufficient knowledge of the existence of Carnatic percussion; many are more familiar with the North Indian classical instruments like the sitar and the tabla. Konnakol remains unknown even to some of our Indian listeners!</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>Is this where your identity as an innovator comes in?</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Yes, I try to think of ways of creating more awareness of Carnatic percussion. I want to introduce listeners to the potential of my instruments.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I was recently involved in a rhythm workshop in Abu Dhabi which brought together musicologists, neuroscientists, performers and many more to speak about rhythm from their points of view. At the end of the workshop was a musical diversity concert in which I performed with an Arabic percussionist, a Spanish percussionist and a Jazz drummer. When I was approached for this performance, the organisers themselves were not entirely sure what Carnatic percussion entailed.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />For my segment, I did a creative <i>kuraippu</i> involving the mridangam, khanjira and konnakol in different <i>nadais.</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>What was the audience\u2019s reaction?</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The audience was extremely receptive. I was pleasantly surprised. What I have learnt through experience is that any form of art is easy to follow if the artists present it in a simple and appealing manner. I explained <i>Adi talam</i> and <i>nadai</i> before I started on my segment. I also introduced konnakol and explained the verbal aspect to percussion, that it is our language of percussion.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>You hold an engineering degree. Has that been beneficial for you in your understanding of rhythm?</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />It most definitely has. I have been involved with research in IIT Madras in Carnatic music and my engineering background allows me to appreciate the study more.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I published a paper, \u2018Automated Stroke Transcription of the Mridangam\u2019, which I will be presenting at a conference in Vancouver next month. I think it is the first scientific paper to be presented with the word mridangam in the title. My science background definitely aided me in writing that paper.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>What is the role of konnakol in today\u2019s world?</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I think konnakol can be used to explain all the mridangam, khanjira and ghatam strokes. I see it as the language of percussion, and not many genres have a similar oral percussive aspect. Unlike percussion instrumentss, konnakol is easily portable. All you need is your voice! It is an art form that will follow you wherever you go and you can present it whenever you want to. It may not feature in a conventional Carnatic concert now but it works very well with other genres. A parallel that can be drawn is \u2018<i>skat singing</i>\u2019 in Blues. I collaborated with a Brazilian pianist who performed <i>skat</i> and I did konnakol to complement that. In collaborations like that, I think konnakol has the capacity to create awareness of Carnatic percussion.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>(Sushma Somasekharan is a young Carnatic vocalist)</b></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
