If the open air space in Besant Nagar proved perfect for the last nagaswaram cutcheri (21 April), Ras Vihar-Sarangi\u2019s old world mansion in Nungambakkam provided a gracious and acoustically sound place for Nisha Rajagopalan\u2019s concert (29 April). Bhamini Gopalakrishnan\u2019s taamarai kolam, flanked by kuthuvilakkus, added to the tranquil enchantment of the performance space.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe Oli team had to be on its toes as the committed audience members take their \u2018please be on time\u2019 plea seriously. They maintain the silence essential for mikeless music, and are with the artistes every step of the way. Rarely does anyone leave before the mangalam.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThis audience discipline was fully rewarded by the young artistes of the day. Nisha gave of her best and so did her supportive partners - Padma Shankar (violin) and Shertalai Ananthakrishnan (mridangam).</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aA theme like Taamarai (lotus) is demanding \u2013 as this polyvalent symbol means a thousand things (see note), in both the terrestrial and extra-terrestrial worlds. Nisha\u2019s planning was impeccable. Her \u2018taamarai\u2019 unfurled many kinds of petals. If Ritigowla <i><b>(En mana taamarai mel)</b></i> made the <i>kairava</i> (white lotus) bloom at moonrise, the opening <i>chatusruti rishabham</i> of <b><i>Saundararajam asraye</i></b> (Brindavana Saranga) welcomed the dawn above the swelling waves, for the red lotus (<i>ambuja</i>) to blush into bloom. And how brilliantly Nisha deployed her voice in the three octaves, mandara, madhya and tara, to make Dikshitar\u2019s magnificence manifest!</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">The Pantuvarali segment focussed on moods more wistful than ripe. The alapana, replete with <i>panchama-varja prayogas</i> and <i>nishada</i>-centric <i>sancharas</i> painted the pathos of the wistful <i>neeraja</i> at nightfall. However, the singer\u2019s unhindered akaram and swarasthana precision saved it from sentimentality.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aPadma Shankar\u2019s reply echoed the same bhava with Hindustani-esque <i>prayogas</i> elongating the <i>dhaivatam.</i> <b><i>Sarasaksha</i></b> expanded the theme of the day convincingly. Shertalai Ananthakrishnan\u2019s niraval accompaniment in <i>Bhamini</i> (<b><i>Sarasaksha</i></b>) and <i>Ambujasanadi</i> (<b><i>Saundararajam</i></b>) were simply superb.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe majestic Kambhoji alapana made the audience expect an even grander kriti. So how could Muttuswami Dikshitar\u2019s <i>Kamalambikayai</i> (the 4th Kamalamba navavarana krti) not make us nod in contentment? Nisha\u2019s treatment of the profusion of classicist <i>sangatis</i> filled the room with a different kind of fragrance. Her voice was so resonant, and her rendering of every nuance so crystal clear, that you almost forgot that the concert was mikeless. The kalapramana was managed adroitly. Not only was the slow tempo never allowed to turn sluggish, it was used to highlight the might of the composition. Padma proved a perfect assistant in this process of exploration and discovery, adding hues and tints to her alapana.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aTime constraints made Nisha taper off the Kambhoji swaraprastara somewhat abruptly. But Ananthakrishnan\u2019s deft fingers and intelligent mind used the <i>tani</i> to round off the suite. To listeners attuned to Adi and Rupaka beats, his tani in <i>Khandajati ata talam</i> brought new scents. With crisp timing, he made intricate <i>laya</i> patterns fall easily on the ears.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aNisha\u2019s lotus bloomed in the bhakti pool. If you looked for post-tani taamarai romance, no, you didn\u2019t get it! However, there was rich poetic imagery as she wrapped up her concert with a lovely Tamil viruttam mainly in Ranjani, imaging the five great Tamil epics (Jivakachintamani, Kundalakesi, Manimekhalai, Valayapati, Silappadhikaram) as goddess Saraswati herself, followed by Dandapani Desikar\u2019s <b><i>Taamarai pootha tadaagam</i></b> in the quaintly named Hindustan Gandhari, and Bharatiyar\u2019s <b><i>Vellai taamarai</i></b> in Karnataka Devagandhari.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aMaintaining a fine balance and variety in her choice of ragas, languages, composers, the gait of the compositions, emotive content and evocative imagery, Nisha Rajagopalan\u2019s concert with Padma Shankar and Shertalai Ananthakrishnan, shaped itself into as much a visual as an aural treat.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><i>The concert</i></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aEn mana taamarai mel \u2013 Ritigaula \u2013 Adi \u2013 G N Balasubramaniam<br />\u000aSarasaksha paripalaya \u2013 Pantuvarali \u2013 Adi \u2013 Maharaja Swati Tirunal<br />\u000aSaundararajam ashraye \u2013 Brndavana Saranga \u2013 Rupakam \u2013 Muttuswami Dikshitar<br />\u000aRama ninne nammi nanu \u2013 Huseni \u2013 Adi \u2013 Tyagaraja<br />\u000aKamalambikayai \u2013 Kambhoji \u2013 Khanda Ata \u2013 Muttuswami Dikshitar Viruttam<br />\u000aTaamarai pootha \u2013 Hindustan Gandhari \u2013 Adi \u2013 M M Dandapani Desikar<br />\u000aVellai Taamarai \u2013 Karnataka Devagandhari \u2013 Adi \u2013 Mahakavi Bharatiyar <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><i>The artistes</i></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rzJgtgl8ffE/T6EJFahnNiI/AAAAAAAAAeU/CKdQU5A0M3s/s1600/Nisha2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rzJgtgl8ffE/T6EJFahnNiI/AAAAAAAAAeU/CKdQU5A0M3s/s320/Nisha2.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><b><i>Nisha Rajagopalan</i></b> is one of the emerging stars of the current generation of Carnatic musicians. An accomplished vocalist, Nisha has trained under veteran gurus like TRS, PSN and Suguna Varadachari, under whose tutelage she has gained an in-depth understanding of the laya and bhava aspects of Carnatic music. Her concerts exhibit a fine balance of verve and substance. Nisha\u2019s resonant voice, with its firm grip on classicism, heightens the emotive appeal of both sahitya and sangita.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b><i>Padma Shankar</i></b> is an upholder of the Lalgudi bani. The initial seed of her musical journey being sown by her vainika mother, Lakshmi Narayanan, Padma\u2019s music is full of depth and classical flavour. Her bhava-soaked playing and sensitive accompaniment are testament to her tutelage under the maestro Lalgudi Jayaraman.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b><i>Sherthalai Anantakrishnan,</i></b> a disciple of Karaikkudi Mani, is a much sought after mridangam artiste. A sound foundation in vocal music, laid by his mother (Lalitha Ramachandran), is reflected only too well in his knowledgeable and perceptive support in lifting the mood of a concert.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b>TAAMARAI: THE THEME</b></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aIn Columbus, Ohio, instead of lawns, the Bank of America created lotus pools around its huge building. And guess what? Business boomed. And the bank became one of the sights of the city.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aNo, it does not surprise us. Indian tradition has it that there are only three objects in the world that we never tire of looking at: the elephant, the moon, and the lotus.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAnd today, as we enjoy the beauty and fragrance of the <i><b>taamarai poo</b></i> in the musical pageant that awaits us, may we remind ourselves of the symbolic dimensions of this exquisite flower, associated with divinities, and believed to be divine in itself.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aPart of the symbolism and art of the three great religions born in India, Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, and the official national flower of modern India, the lotus represents values for both the earthly life, and life hereafter. It brings honour, good fortune, prosperity, the promise of long life and fertility, as it can survive years of drought to regerminate. It signals victory - doesn\u2019t it struggle through earthy sludge and water, to bloom in the air, warmed by the sun?</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aIn all Asian cultures, the lotus indicates cosmic rejuvenation and primordial radiance. Nourished by the four elements, the <b><i>padma</i></b> signals the ultimate state beyond them. Yogis venerate it as the <b><i>sahasrara chakra,</i></b> while the Buddha visualized it in his <b><i>dharma chakra.</i></b> To the Jains it is spiritual elevation. Confucian thought admires its unsullied purity. In Japan it spells truth and immortality. The Bhagavad Gita images the lotus, growing in water but untouched by it, as the detached <b><i>stithaprajna.</i></b></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSo, when an Indian artist carves a lotus, he doesn\u2019t have to put it in the hands of a God to signify transcendence. When an Indian poet speaks of karakamala, padapadma, mukhaaravinda, sarasijanabha, vanaajasana or neerajakshi, he is thinking of spiritual magnetism.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aIn all this <b><i>bhakti</i></b> and <b><i>mukti,</i></b> let us not forget that the lotus also spells heady romance. Remember lovelorn Sakuntala tossing and turning on a bed of lotuses? Her love letter scratched on a lotus leaf?</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aWe leave you with a tender Chinese metaphor: the lotus represents family bonds, because countless separate threads are lovingly meshed in the stalk that bears the fragrant bloom!</div></div>
