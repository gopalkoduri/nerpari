His father Mitta Lakshminarasiah, was a leading lawyer of Hyderabad. Keen on music, the senior Mitta would come home on Thursdays (Friday was a holiday in the Nizam\u2019s Hyderabad) and close his office for the weekend, to play the tabla or the harmonium and sing with his wife and six children for an audience. \u201cVakil sahib\u2019s\u201d home was the gateway to the twin cities for most visiting musicians.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Janardan, who joined the film industry in Madras back in 1956 and became a permanent fixture as a sitarist in films made here for over four decades, picked up his sister\u2019s sitar once she left home after marriage. By 1952, he had successfully auditioned before stalwarts Pandit Ratanjankar and Veerendra Kishore and started playing for Deccan Radio. He first heard Ravi Shankar live in 1955, when he came to Hyderabad for a Sangeet Sammelan concert. Janardan had completed his M.A. and was now doing his second year in engineering, but was dying to take up music full time. His father said he had six sons and so didn\u2019t mind one of them taking to music. He took Janardan to meet Ravi Shankar. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d was Ravi Shankar\u2019s response when Lakshminarasiah said he would take Janardan out of engineering college if Ravi Shankar would take him as a disciple.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r2_uflcQKXA/TvAibsCW1iI/AAAAAAAAALU/lqSJui3Uej0/s1600/pandit_ravi_shankar.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r2_uflcQKXA/TvAibsCW1iI/AAAAAAAAALU/lqSJui3Uej0/s320/pandit_ravi_shankar.gif" width="303" /></a></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Ravi Shankar came to Hyderabad again in 1956, and this time he did listen to the young sitarist. He said, \u201cYou seem to know some of the advanced things without knowing the basics.\u201d He appreciated the way Janardan played the raga, the taan and the meend, but corrected a basic mistake he was making in the number of front and back strokes. \u201cThat\u2019s why I need a guruji,\u201d the young man shot back in all innocence. Ravi Shankar asked him to apply for a government scholarship, but though he did not get it, Janardan still went to Delhi in 1956 to learn from Ravi Shankar. It was a busy year for Ravi Shankar. He had just quit the AIR job and become a full time musician. That year he travelled to Afghanistan for the first time on a concert tour. \u201cWhenever he found time to teach us in the midst of his travels, he opened a treasure box,\u201d Janardan remembers.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Janardan was one of the students to take part in the annual camp in Benares. Kartik Kumar, Shamim Ahmed, Rama Rao and Arun Bharat Ram were some of the others. At the classes, Ravi Shankar was a strict disciplinarian. \u201cHe was never satisfied until you got every nuance right,\u201d he said. \u201cOutside the classroom, he was a friend, mixing freely with everyone. At Benares, we always had lunch with him. \u2018Today, we have an apology for sambar,\u2019 he would apologise. In the evening, we were free to go where we chose, but sometimes he would accompany us on outings, taking a childlike pleasure in simple things. He took us on boat rides to watch the sunset, even liked to go to movies. Once after a concert in Chennai, he said, \u2018Let\u2019s go to Bobby\u2019, referring to the Hindi superhit film of the 1970s.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">\u201cGuruji had been trained in the tough school of Ustad Alauddin Khan. He taught him dhrupad, the surbahar, complicated tala-s. It was Guruji who reintroduced the complex laya techniques of Carnatic music like tisra nadai and khanda nadai to Hindustani music, which had lost them over time. Even last year, he played a composition set to a tala of 10.5 beats at a Hyderabad concert. Every Sunday for a whole year, he presented a programme of \u2018aparichit\u2019 or new raga-s, 52 different raga-s.\u201d<br />\u000a<br />\u000aJanardan has the greatest respect for Ravi Shankar\u2019s intellect. \u201cFor instance, Guruji had an original explanation for the relative simplicity of laya in Hindustani music. In the north, we sang for the king, while musicians sang for God in the south. At the temple, they sang without inhibition, exploring the entire range of raga and tala, with no fear of displeasing their compassionate God. But in the durbar, you did not dare to go beyond teen taal for fear of offending the king who would not then know how to keep the beat along with you.\u201d<br />\u000a<br />\u000aRavi Shankar\u2019s regard for Carnatic music and musicians is well known. \u201cHe still keeps track of what\u2019s happening here,\u201d says Janardan. \u201cHe keenly watches the careers of young musicians like T.M. Krishna, Vijay Siva and Sanjay Subrahmanyan.\u201d</div></div>
