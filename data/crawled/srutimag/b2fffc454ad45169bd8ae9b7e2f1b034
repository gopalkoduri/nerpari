Venkatarama Sastry\u2014whose birth centenary was celebrated in 2007-2008\u2014showed early signs of musical talent, which his father nourished by exposing him to the best available training with distinguished gurus.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aVenkatarama Sastry\u2019s family from the Hassan district of Karnataka belonging to the Sanketi community went on to produce some nine more musicians at last count, with Sangita Kalanidhi R.K. Srikantan still going strong with his magnificent voice at the age of 92.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAfter spending more than a decade learning violin from Veena Subbanna and Mysore T. Chowdiah, Venkatarama Sastry moved to Madras in 1936, to join All India Radio when it was formed.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aWhile some old timers believe that Venkatarama Sastry\u2019s violin playing resembled his guru Chowdiah\u2019s seven-string style, grandson and top ranking Carnatic violinist R.K. Shriramkumar does not entirely agree. According to him, Venkatarama Sastry came under the influence of Papa Venkataramiah soon after moving to Madras and eschewed the seven-string instrument in favour of the orthodox four-string violin.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aHis music was predominantly shaped by all the best vocalists of the day. Sastry insisted that the violin should always be based on the vocal style. He stressed bhasha gnanam or knowledge of languages and the primacy of sahitya, often citing the example of M.S. Subbulakshmi, whom he accompanied for years.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t pronounce words in a contrived manner,\u201d he advised disciples, \u201crespect languages.\u201d He learnt a large number of songs in his lifetime and because he wanted Shriramkumar to follow in his footsteps, sent him to D.K. Jayaraman to learn vocal music.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aHe was a strong votary of the significance of the works of great sahityakartas, and the importance of the way the lyric and the music should fuse together. He firmly believed that the sweep and grandeur of the great ragas could be internalised only by learning a vast number of compositions. Sastry taught his students several kritis and believed in the aural tradition. \u201cNo tapes, no notebooks.\u201d</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aVenkatarama Sastry insisted that the violinist savour the words, running through them repeatedly in the mind while performing niraval. It is the importance of this aspect of violin playing that led Sastry to enrol his own grandson Shriramkumar with V.V. Subramanyam for specialised violin coaching.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aTyagaraja was God to him. He performed at the annual aradhana at Tiruvaiyaru for 40 successive years. Vedanta interested Sastry deeply. He refused to move out of his Nungambakkam residence in order to stay close to Kalyanasundaram Sastrigal\u2019s Vedanta classes he attended in the neighbourhood.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSastry demanded that his students play only the compositions of the great vaggeyakaras of Carnatic music. The songs of the Trinity, Purandaradasa, <i>Tevaram,</i> and <i>Tiruppugazh</i> were examples of verses he approved. An advocate of the classical and ghana ragas, his tastes in violin music tended to err on the side of the conservative.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aIn later years, he was a great admirer of T.N. Krishnan\u2019s music, which he recommended as an ideal to be followed. In vocal music he appreciated the titans of his time\u2014Ariyakudi, Semmangudi, Musiri, Brinda-Muktha and M.S. Subbulakshmi.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aR.K. Venkatarama Sastry was respected by everyone throughout his career. A principled, non-controversial figure, he brought dignity to whatever he did\u2014whether accompanying MS or Semmangudi on the performance stage or expressing his views as a member of the Experts Committee, spending whole days at the Music Academy.</div></div>
