Dhananjayan</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cBhava sangeetam\u201d or expressive music is synonymous with <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">M.D. Ramanathan.</a> In this century, I have not heard such bhava-laden Carnatic music as that sung by <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MDR.</a> Two years ago, when I performed the dance-drama <i><a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja</a> Vaibhavam</i> in Hyderabad, a learned, elderly person walked up to the stage at the conclusion of the performance. He asked me a simple question, \u201cHave you heard <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MDR</a> singing <i>Nannu vidachi</i> (Reetigaula)? You brought back to me memories of his music and now I fully realise the meaning of the song; you made me visualise <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MDR\u2019s</a> rendering of it.\u201d I bowed humbly before him and said that whenever I performed a <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja</a> kriti I tried to express the spirit of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MDR\u2019s</a> singing.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />If I am able to evoke in an audience the memory of a person, composer or a particular rendition by a singer, it is proof of the indelible mark that person has left in the memories of connoisseurs. At that moment in Hyderabad, I was so proud to have been closely associated with <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MDR</a> and pleased that all the time I had spent with him had not been in vain.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I remember my first meeting with <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MDR</a> in 1953. I was a young lad from a remote village who did not know anything about music or dance. I had no experience of attending a Carnatic music concert. When <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MDR</a> sang <i>Vatapi ganapatim</i> in Hamsadhwani, I burst out laughing. Someone behind me caught me by my shirt collar and dragged me out of the Kalakshetra Panchami hall. Later on, as a student in Kalakshetra, I had the good fortune of playing the tambura for hours together at <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MDR\u2019s</a> concerts. All that listening to his wonderful bhava sangeetam has been absorbed into my veins, giving me a way of understanding the true spirit of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja</a> and other composers.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MDR</a> was a musician\u2019s musician. His scholarship in literature (Samskritam \u2013 I prefer this to Sanskrit, Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu) made him great and placed him above other successful musicians. He delved deep into the sahitya of each song and explained them to his students as well as to listeners like me. My wife Shanta had the good fortune of attending his master classes, and she was a pet student of his.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />All his mannerisms faded away from the attention of a connoisseur the moment his music flowed into the ear. His sruti alignment, pronunciation and the way he split words according to their correct meaning made his music more enjoyable, though to some people his rendering of the words may have sounded just musical, not verbal.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Every passage he sang was an essay in itself. I have not admired a musician as much as I have <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MDR,</a> not just for his music, but also for his qualities as a human being. He was very charitable, humorous, approachable, caring and generous. He was a true \u201csthitapragna\u201d, not perturbed by criticism or praise. Singing, to him, was an upasana; sangeetam that was totally involved in the bhava of the lyrics and spirit of the composer.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />His own compositions are not yet popular. Worthy disciples like P.P. Ramakrishnan should be encouraged by connoisseurs to bring out <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MDR\u2019s</a> unique compositions \u2013 kriti-s, keertana-s and tillana-s. Once that is done, in course of time <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MDR</a> will join the galaxy of the 20th century vaggeyakara-s.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
