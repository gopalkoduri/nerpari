Black clouds filled the sky. There was a slight drizzle. In the dim light of the shaded street lamps, the sky seemed to be shedding tears from a sorrow too deep for words.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aI simply couldn\u2019t bear the gloomy sight. I came into the house. My mind was sunk in dejection. I shut the windows against both aggravations and switched the lights on. I picked up a book, hoping that it would bring about a change of mood.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aReaders may wish to know why I felt depressed. Aren\u2019t there reasons galore for depression? The state of the world and of the country can furnish any number of reasons for low spirits. As if these were not enough, a report in the evening newspaper exhausted whatever reserves of zest I may have had.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThere had been a train accident somewhere between Kudalur and Chidambaram. Having left Egmore last night, the Boat Mail had met with a serious accident. The cause was yet unknown. But the city heard several versions of the story. The official explanation was that the tracks had been washed away in a sudden and heavy downpour. Rumour had it that someone had deliberately sabotaged the tracks because a high-ranking official of the Railways was travelling by the train. There were endless rumours about the numbers of the dead.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aI was not as badly shaken by the news that a hundred, maybe even two hundred, persons had met their deaths in the accident. But I felt as if the train had crashed right over me when I scanned the long death list and came across a certain name.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aReaders may remember Iyampettai Kandappan. He was the tavil player who had told me the story of the nagaswaram maestro Sivakozhundu. Seeing his name among the dead hit me hard.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aFor God has made us like that. We don\u2019t react when we hear of twenty thousand people dying in a volcanic eruption in America. Yet we feel miserable when we hear of the death of someone we know personally.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShould Iyampettai Kandappan have met such a tragic end? What a wonderful man he was! What a patriot! So good and conscientious! With such affection for his friends! A true connoisseur!</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThe sound of a horse cab halting in front of my house disturbed my reflections. \u2018Who can it be at this hour?\u2019 I wondered with some distaste. My mind was in no fit state for me to receive anyone.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aA second later the front door was opened. I wouldn\u2019t have been more astounded if I had found Adolf Hitler or General Tojo on my doorstep. For the man who stood there was none other than Iyampettai Kandappan.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Don\u2019t be afraid! It is I myself in the flesh, not my ghost!\u2019 When I heard Kandappan\u2019s voice, amazement turned to overwhelming delight.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Welcome, welcome!\u2019 I cried as I took him by the hand and made him take a seat.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018What happened? How did you manage to escape from the train accident? I was terribly upset to see your name in the newspaper. How could they make such a mistake? Shame on them!\u2019 I went on and on in excitement.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Thank God I didn\u2019t board that train! I had reserved my seat in advance. My tavil and luggage had been loaded on to the compartment but I myself reached the station two minutes after the train had left. I was lucky\u2026\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Your name must have been on the passengers\u2019 list. Seeing that and your tavil, the press obviously decided to send you straight to heaven!\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018I think so.\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Won\u2019t your people be worried? Why didn\u2019t you go home today?\u2019 I asked him.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018I\u2019ve sent them a telegram. I thought I should give you a fright before I went home.\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018You tried to scare me?\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Yes. Didn\u2019t you frighten us in the same manner in one of your stories? This is my revenge.\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Such things can happen in stories. Not in real life,\u2019 I said.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018You are completely wrong,\u2019 Kandappan averred.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018How can you be so absolutely sure of that?\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Because I have seen such a thing happen in real life.\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018What thing?\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Danger arose because a man presumed dead made a sudden appearance.\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018What kind of danger?\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Danger to life.\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aI knew then that Kandappan had come with the specific intent of relating an interesting incident.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Tell me all about it, I\u2019d love to hear it. My mind is very unsettled today. I feel extremely depressed. Perhaps, if I listen to your story\u2026\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018\u2026This is not a story to arouse enthusiasm. It is steeped in grief. Perhaps we\u2019ll keep it for another day\u2026\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Not at all. You must listen to a sad story especially when you feel depressed. So tell me now\u2026\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aKandappa Pillai began all his tales with a question. He made no exception this time. He cleared his throat in preparation and asked me, \u2018Do you recall having heard of Poonthottam Bhavani?\u2019</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aI recognized the name but as if through the mists of a previous birth. I remembered having listened to two or three gramophone \u2018plates\u2019 by her. But Kandappa Pillai did not wait for me to prod my memory any further. He went on.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Thirty years ago, Poonthottam Bhavani was a celebrated name. She was also known as Veenai Bhavani. When she sang with the veena on her lap, it was as if the goddess Saraswati herself donned a human form and appeared before us. You could compare her voice only to the ringing resonance of the veena\u2019s string when her fingers plucked it. The sound she evoked from the veena found its match only in her voice. Her concerts were held before assemblies of thousands of people who listened in rapt silence. They lost themselves in her music.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018Bhavani performed frequently in temples, particularly at the Tiruvarur temple during festival time. Nowadays we see atheism gaining ground. Rationalists\u2019 movements and Self-Respect movements are making things worse for the world. On top of all this, we have the advent of cinema. There are very few left who will conduct temple festivals with care and solicitude.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018But in those days people found their enjoyment only in the rituals and festivities connected to the temples. From twenty miles around people would throng in multitudes to attend them.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018At festival time music concerts were held in the kalyana mandapam of the temple. Every concert drew capacity crowds, but Poonthottam Bhavani\u2019s recitals broke all records. \u201cAs great a crowd as at Poonthottam Bhavani\u2019s concerts\u201d became a common phrase of the times.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018You can imagine the din and racket at such colossal gatherings. But Bhavani\u2019s fingers had only to touch the strings, she had only to raise her head slightly and align her sweet voice to their pitch. The noise subsided at once. As Bhavani\u2019s mellifluous voice, accompanied by the veena\u2019s resonance rose, and the audience fell silent, there was a hint of other-worldly magic.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u2018I never missed a chance to attend Bhavani\u2019s concerts. And I did often get to hear her. I found that Bhavani\u2019s concerts were also held at many of the weddings and temple functions to which I was invited in my professional capacity. Tears would come to my eyes whenever I listened to her music. I would drop my head down, pretending to have a headache, so that the others did not laugh at my response. You ask me the reason for those tears? I don\u2019t know myself. Were they tears of bliss? Or evoked by fears that so marvellous an outpouring may be short-lived? Can such music last long? Can the world bear such divine ecstasy? A few others would worry about the effects of the evil eye on the artiste. I invariably went to meet Bhavani after every concert and told her, \u201cThangachi, ask your mother to take some ritual precautions against the evil eye.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a(Reproduced from <i>KALKI Selected Stories</i> Centenary Edition, Penguin Books, 1999)<br />\u000a<span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Copyright this version Gowri Ramnarayan 2012</span></span></div><div style="text-align: right;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>(<a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/sruti-fiction_25.html" target="_blank">Continued</a>)</b></span></div></div>
