V<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><b>V Ramnarayan</b></div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">\u201cLook up the meaning of the Tyagaraja kriti <i>Sangita gnanamu</i> in the book there ,\u201d the frail old man bundled up and blanketed in the chair in front of me said, a minute after I entered his bedroom in his nephew\u2019s house inside Sankarnagar, Tirunelveli, when my friend Sampathkumar and I visited him earlier this month. </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-et1HSajsqkA/Tx_cbvUF6PI/AAAAAAAAARc/VOBowGRES2k/s1600/Tanjavur+Sankara+Iyer+1.tif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-et1HSajsqkA/Tx_cbvUF6PI/AAAAAAAAARc/VOBowGRES2k/s320/Tanjavur+Sankara+Iyer+1.tif" width="242" /></a></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aNear nonagenarian and confirmed bachelor Tanjavur Sankara Iyer may be a very sick man today, needing the constant care of a loving family, but his musical creativity and devotion to past masters including the Trinity remain undimmed. True to the words of Tyagaraja, he still pursues <i>sangita gnanamu</i> with fervent devotion, still composes his own bhava-rich compositions and still sings and teaches everyday. The object of his love and affection and guru <i>kripa</i> is his 12-year-old granddaughter Aparna, on whom he pins his hopes for the future.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aFor those unfamiliar with Sankara Iyer\u2019s contribution to Carnatic music, I reproduce below a brief extract from a Sruti (issue 195) profile of the vidwan by Lakshmi Devnath:</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSankara Iyer is a highly respected vaggeyakara. His compositions have been a source of delight both to the vidwans and to the general public, but he himself speaks with great modesty about his works. \u201cI should not be bracketed with the Trinity or other famous composers of the past. But I can say my compositions are rooted in sampradaya, as theirs are, while they cater at the same time to evolving needs without being light. Shall I say, my compositions are a bridge between the old and the new!\u201d </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAnyone who has listened to Sankara Iyer\u2019s vocal concerts, lec-dems and his own compositions, will readily agree that he is indeed a bridge between the old and the new.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aMy planned interview with Sankara Iyer never took place, because, thrilled to meet visitors from Chennai, he was keen to demonstrate his granddaughter\u2019s singing, and more important her ability to absorb his lessons on sruti suddham, raga lakshana, and clear enunciation of sahitya. He stressed the vital importance of the last of these aspects of music, but was quick point out that on his list of priorities, the raga overrode the Bhakti emanating from understanding of the lyrics. \u201cThe lyrics could be about Rama, Krishna or Karuppannasami; it\u2019s the musicality that matters.\u201d</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aWe were fortunate to catch glimpses of his highly evolved sense of aesthetics through his profound enjoyment of the beauty of both verse and tune, whether by the Trinity, Sankara Iyer himself or Kalki Krishnamurti, whose <i>Poonkuil koovum pooncholaiyil orunal,</i> he taught Aparna with obvious relish. \u201cWhat a wonderful poet!\u201d he exclaimed. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aWhen I reminded him about a T Viswanathan concert he had attended more than a decade ago at my Chennai home after which I dropped him home, he instantly recalled, \u201cMuktha was in the audience, wasn\u2019t she, and I remember she joined Viswa in a song whose words he momentarily forgot. In the car, you asked me if I would perform at your residence. What happened to that offer?\u201d</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThat was indeed a doosra from the veteran. I had no answer to that.</div></div>
