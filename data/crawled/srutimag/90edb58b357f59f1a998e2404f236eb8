It features classical musicians in weekend chamber music performances twice a month, from February 2012. Established and up and coming artistes will alternate in this programmes. The senior artistes will showcase ragas and compositions based on their own tradition, special features of their gurus, or distinct aspects of their <i>bani.</i> The young artiste will present a theme-based recital in an attempt to revive and reclaim our musical heritage. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i>Oli</i> affords a platform for diverse styles of music, for rendering rare kinds of music, compositions which may not be suitable for a large audience, and allow greater freedom for <i>manodharma</i> music. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">No microphones are used so that the tonal qualities of voice and instrument are reproduced with their natural timbre and resonance intact. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i>Oli</i> features two concerts every month, at different venues; designed for an audience of 30-40 persons. These concerts are free.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i>Oli Chamber Concerts</i> is an initiative of Gowri Ramnarayan, with Bharathi Ramasubban, Rithwik Raja and MV Swaroop.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_7i8DntRNJo/T1Wir4KtfRI/AAAAAAAAAVM/8BoQoVs2W84/s1600/tnk1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_7i8DntRNJo/T1Wir4KtfRI/AAAAAAAAAVM/8BoQoVs2W84/s1600/tnk1.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Concert 1</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">TN Krishnan \u2013 Violin</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">J Vaidyanathan \u2013 Mridangam</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">N Guruprasad \u2013 Ghatam</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Arkay Convention Centre | 12th February 2012 | 6.15 PM</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The Artistes</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The tonal purity of TN Krishnan\u2019s instrument, his graceful bowing technique, his phrases replete with <i>bhava</i> and <i>gamaka,</i> not to forget his poignant silences, all combine to make his music reflective and soulful. Krishnan\u2019s violin playing is often described as a second voice. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">He has accompanied almost all yesteryear giants and his strength lies in his ability to effortlessly adapt his playing to each<i> bani.</i> As a soloist, he has scaled great peaks.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">J Vaidyanathan comes from a great music lineage. From his father DK Jayaraman, and aunt DK Pattammal, he received the legacy of a vast repertoire of compositions along with a fastidious <i>pathantara suddham.</i> Vaidyanathan\u2019s masterful and sensitive playing is enticing at analytical and emotional levels. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">N Guruprasad: This popular and talented artiste is the son and disciple of ghatam vidvan Nagaraja Rao. His dextrous playing, empathetic accompaniment, and ability to reproduce highly complicated patterns, have made him a sought after musician. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The Concert</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Deep into the tukkada section of his concert, TN Krishnan launched into a scintillating Surati alapana. Sangatis soaked in the raga were gushing through every pore of his violin when he stopped at Surati\u2019s quirky kaakali nishadam, and said, \u201cAh. That\u2019s where that nishadam is.\u201d He played it once more, looked at us in the front row, holding that quivering swara somewhere between the dhaivatam and the nishadam, and said again, \u201cThere. That\u2019s it! Semmangudi Mama used to always tell us this. And I can share it with you only when you sit this close, not when you are sitting miles away in a large hall.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">At that moment, our faith in <i>Oli,</i> starting that day, mikeless, at small venues for about 30-40 serious music listeners, was vindicated. We were on to a sound idea, we knew. There is still place today for the fine sound of a solo violin, the power of a pure voice, and a veena not booming through a contact microphone.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When the concert started, I was at the sound console, adjusting the balance for the recording we were doing. I heard much of the Chakravakam (<i>Gajananayutam</i>) through headphones, but I came to the front row for the next piece. TN Krishnan played the first two lines of <i>Deva Deva</i> in Mayamalavagowla, and it struck me: The violin sounds startlingly different without a mike - the sound is so much more delicate, so much stiller. And when the sound comes straight from its source, there is such animmediacy about it, you can feel the swaras, you can almost touch the gamakas. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">A swinging swaraprastaram followed in the maestro\u2019s inimitable style, stitching patterns of beguiling simplicity, and landing beautifully at the eduppu in all sorts of combinations, all with a smile on his face. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Then came a Yadukulakambhoji alapana, a sound for the gods, phrase after phrase of what can only be described by the ambiguous term, \u2018rakti\u2019 - an amalgam of feel, intuition, musicianship, scholarship and experience. Every sangati, every nuance, every little inflection was a reaffirmation of Yadukulakambhoji\u2019s identity.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Tyagaraja\u2019s <i>Enduku Dayaradura</i> in Todi was the sumptuous main course. J. Vaidyanathan\u2019s mridangam peppered the kriti with the most beauteous rhythms - murmuring here, whirring there, rustling elsewhere. With N. Guruprasad on the ghatam, the percussion section caught the precise pulse of the concert, the atmosphere, the acoustics and the audience. </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When Krishnan asked them to play the tani at the end of this kriti, I was a little disappointed - it felt like everything was ending too soon. The audience was unnaturally calm, listening in complete silence, no fidgeting, no consulting raga books or discussing the finer aspects of the music with their neighbours. The setting was not flashy, there were no sponsor banners or jarring backdrops (in fact, three sarees were hung from the ceiling to form the backdrop), the lighting was muted, two vilakkus stood proudly on either side of the stage, Arkay Convention Centre looked like never before, and I was sitting three feet away from a colossus enjoying playing in this setting. I wanted to listen to a lot more, I didn\u2019t want the tani to arrive in the fourth piece of the evening.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Little did I know that elaborate renditions of Kapi, Behag and Sindhubhairavi were waiting for me on the other side of the tani. They say if you are not afraid of a cliché, if you go at like it is the first time it\u2019s ever been done, you can still bring freshness to it. Krishnan breathed that freshness into <i>Jagadoddharana</i> and <i>Venkatachalanilayam.</i> And then we came back to the Surati - a <i>Sri Venkatagirisham</i> in the finest traditions of the Semmangudi school, played by one of the school\u2019s proudest disciples amidst extreme nostalgia. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;"></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><br />\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;"><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Pieces performed:</i></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;">1.
