An obviously talented young percussionist, the schoolboy also proved lucky in more ways than one.<br /><br />To be taught mridangam by one of the better teachers around\u2014his grandfather KS Kalidas\u2014a disciple of the eminent Palani Subramania Pillai, as well as his father Ashok Kalidas, was, along with his genetic predisposition to music, surely one of nature\u2019s gifts bestowed on Rohit. <br /><br />The setting was perfect too, with many top musicians and gurus as well as discerning listeners packing the hall in an obvious show of affection and respect for the lad and his grandfather-guru. <br /><br />Rohit could not have asked for better vidushis or vidwans either to accompany on this all-important day of his life. Vocalist Sumitra Vasudev and violinist Dr R Hemalatha are both fine artists, among the most accomplished and nuanced musicians around, but rendered even more apposite for the occasion by their empathy for the young percussionist. <br /><br />The main suite in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Todi</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">was exquisite</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">\u2014</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">in raga alapana, kriti rendition, niraval and swaraprastara, in&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">more or less</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">equal measure</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">\u2014</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">though to me the raga alapana was the best part, with vocalist and violinist delighting the ear with unexpected phrases as much as keenly anticipated \u2018known\u2019variations.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />When Sumitra sketched the higher notes with some brilliant strokes, I was eagerly expecting her to stay there for a long while, but she descended rather soon from the peak after some tantalizing glimpses of the grandeur of the raga at that altitude. Perhaps she will let herself go completely on another occasion, getting drowned and drowning us in turn in the flood of her imagination. Hemalatha was delicacy personified. In the way she embellished the main artist\u2019s explorations with her own creativity without once exceeding her defined role as accompanist, Hemalatha was true to her consistent propensity to do so, regardless of the stature of the main artist.<br /><br />A festive atmosphere pervaded the concert, with the rasikas palpably willing the boy on towards an excellent display befitting the occasion, and he did not disappoint us. When, during the course of her felicitatory address, Sangita Kalanidhi R Vedavalli confessed her nervousness about the effect of two hours of drumming on the youngster\u2019s soft, adolescent hands and finger, she was reflecting the collective anxiety of the audience. But Rohit passed the test with flying colours, demonstrating the efficacy of the intelligent hard work he had put in through years of abhyasa.<br /><br />Both Vedavalli and fellow speaker Sangita Kala Acharya PS Narayanaswami blessed the boy wholeheartedly, after certifying him to be a true legatee of the great Palani tradition of percussion. They expressed their admiration for the youngster\u2019s confidence and spirit of adventure in doing a tani avartanam in jhampa tala and his courageous rhythmic sallies, while acknowledging Sumitra\u2019s contribution in the \u2018merciless\u2019challenges she set him.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">They both applauded Kalidas\u2019s thorough preparation of his ward for the occasion, as they did the general high quality of his disciples, two of whom helped young Rohit on stage.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Rohit\u2019s parents played a dignified part in the proceedings of the evening, while honouring the guests on the dais and delivering a vote of thanks.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The prayer song by Brinda Manickavasagam and the compering by Nikila Shyam Sunder measured up to the overall standard of the evening\u2019s fare.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
