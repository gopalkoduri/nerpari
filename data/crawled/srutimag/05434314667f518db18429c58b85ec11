Viswanathan</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />In <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/02/child-ms-meets-teacher.html" target="_blank"><i>Child MS meets a teacher</i></a> in the <i>Sruti</i> blog, Gowri Ramnarayan describes how young <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_18.html" target="_blank">MS</a> played with the tambura and how she was hypnotised by the sound of the tambura strings. A sruti soaked voice is a pure delight to the ears. It helps the singer to establish instant rapport with the listener. \u201cSruti mata laya pita\u201d is an often quoted saying, but I wonder how much attention is paid to develop sruti sense in a beginner in Carnatic music?</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The first music lesson for a child must focus on developing sruti sense. She must be taught to play the tambura first for half an hour a day, encouraged to keep her ears on the tambura stem and listen to <i>sa pa sa.</i> Then she should be taught to tune the tambura.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The sruti box is not a substitute for the tambura. The beginner must listen only to sruti-aligned music. <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_8664.html" target="_blank">Bhimsen Joshi,</a> Kishori Amonkar, <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_18.html" target="_blank">M.S. Subbulakshmi,</a> <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_26.html" target="_blank">T. Brinda</a> and <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_04.html" target="_blank">K.V. Narayanaswamy</a> are some of the names that come to mind as sruti-perfect voices.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />These artists had flawless vocal techniques, with no false voice singing, no nasal sound, no straining of the voice, no affected singing, no excesses of any kind. There is nothing unique about them except that they had an efficient vocal technique, sang open mouthed without restraint, and had excellent breath control.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_02.html" target="_blank">Madurai Mani Iyer</a> and <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">M.D. Ramanathan</a> sang in perfect alignment with sruti, but the child may imbibe their unique vocal technique and try to imitate them. It takes time to appreciate the right things in music of say <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music.html" target="_blank">Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar</a> or <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-of-indian-classical-music.html" target="_blank">Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer.</a> They had problems of voice but compensated with superlative gnanam and other aspects of Carnatic music. The child can be taught to appreciate sruti perfection even by listening to old film songs of P. Suseela, Lata Mangeshkar, or Kishore Kumar, emphasising their sruti perfection and flawless singing styles. Kelvi gnanam is as important as learning from a teacher. Sabha-s can encourage youngsters to play the tambura for established artists. The outcome of this could be improved sruti sense among the future generation of Carnatic musicians.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
