Relatives and friends from outside Madras call me with their travel and ticketing plans, my teacher and I discuss and re-discuss his concert schedule every time we meet, there are emails in my inbox with offers for live and recorded webcasts of concerts, I find a link to this blog on my facebook feed, and the strains of a nagaswaram playing a surreal Nattaikurinji wafted through the air at a friend\u2019s wedding.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OpI7SjKGxuE/TtRzIKibTmI/AAAAAAAAAFE/FOwu4xvKBPg/s1600/Vyasarbadi+Kothandaraman.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OpI7SjKGxuE/TtRzIKibTmI/AAAAAAAAAFE/FOwu4xvKBPg/s320/Vyasarbadi+Kothandaraman.jpg" width="256" /></a></div><br />\u000aWhen Vyasarpadi Kothandaraman played Nattaikurinji yesterday, oblivious to the indifferent audience, from a neglected corner of a cavernous hall, the celebratory cacophony of the wedding melted into irrelevance. I sat in a corner and found myself drowning in a deluge of beauty.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAn idea is thrown into the air, a <i>ma ga sa</i> phrase for instance. A contemplative silence is succeeded by development of this same phrase - a <i>sa ri ga ma ga sa</i>. Variations on this theme come in a torrent - twisting, twirling notes coiling around one another, only to untangle themselves at the original <i>ma ga sa</i>. He wasn\u2019t building a structure brick by brick; he was a painter drawing rough outlines and filling in the details with an assured hand and vibrant flair. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe alapana proceeds for a while, ten minutes, or perhaps twenty, I don\u2019t really know. Time becomes fuzzy by now. I wonder if I should request him to play my favourite Nattaikurinji song, <i>Ekkaalatthilum,</i> but I don\u2019t want to disturb him. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aHe starts a song I don\u2019t recognise, and barely gets past the second sangati of the pallavi when my trance is broken by a sudden, heavy, unmindful pounding of the tavil and a loud, continuous tara sthayi <i>sa</i> from three nagaswarams in unison. Wagging his finger from fifty metres away, the priest has cruelly transformed the nagaswaram from a musical instrument to an alarm-like device that attracts people\u2019s attention to the stage.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe Nattaikurinji never reaches the same heights again, and the tussle with the priest becomes the theme song of the morning. Surely there are better ways to attract people\u2019s attention?</div></div>
