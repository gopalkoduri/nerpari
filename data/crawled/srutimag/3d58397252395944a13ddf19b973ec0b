He faulted the Vidyalaya for failing to produce topnotch musicians in\u000aits seventyfive years of existence. The same criticism can be laid at the\u000adoorstep of many a formal institution teaching the performing arts. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I wonder if it is at all the objective of teaching\u000ainstitutions to produce performers of calibre. Or, turning the question on its\u000ahead, can great artists be churned out by institutions? Can even a guru ever\u000atake credit for an illustrious sishya? Can an illustrious performer produce\u000aanother illustrious performer? </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">These are questions without easy answers, but there have been\u000aexceptional institutions in the history of classical music. They were made\u000aexceptional by exceptional teachers. Gurus like Musiri Subramania Iyer and his\u000aown sishya Govinda Rao, for instance. Look at how many outstanding musicians,\u000aand even more important, outstanding gurus, such teachers and such institutions\u000ahave produced. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">TR Balamani is one such product of a great guru and a great\u000ainstitution like the Central College of Carnatic Music of yore. She herself has\u000aclear views on the role of the guru. In an interview for Sruti, she said to K\u000aVenkat:</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><i>The onus of producing students of high calibre lies with\u000athe guru. The guru must guide and groom the students correctly right from the\u000ainception. A guru must set a strong foundation by teaching varnams in great\u000adetail. A wealth of music resides in the varnams, and learning and practising\u000aas many varnams as you can will set a strong base in order to build a&nbsp;\u000amusical edifice. </i></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<div style="line-height: 125%;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2014/05/my-heart-was-always-in-teaching-music.html" target="_blank">(To read the whole interview, Click Here):</a><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; line-height: 125%;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Balamani also belongs to another rare breed: the wonderful\u000agurus of Bombay. Again how many of them went from Kerala via Madras to Bombay!\u000aThese teachers much beloved of their students not only passed on their musical\u000atreasures to their little wards at their little Bombay flats as in the case of\u000aBalamani, TS Krishnaswami, Bombay Ramachandran, Alamelu Mani or more recently\u000aVamanan, to name a few, but many of them also taught at institutions like\u000aShanmukhananda Sabha, Bharatiya Fine Arts Society, and Fine Arts Chembur.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Much of my knowledge of Balamani came from talking to Bombay\u000aJayashri whom I interviewed for Sruti. She would recall how immaculate her\u000aguru\u2019s planning and time management was, how considerate she was of her young\u000apupils. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">She spoke of the idlis and hot drinks that would be ready for\u000aher at Mami\u2019s pattu class for her to have before going to the afternoon shift\u000aof her school. How Mami would have finished her day\u2019s work before 9.30 am and\u000athe kitchen would be spanking clean, all set for the class.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Teaching methods may vary and so may the gurus\u2019 ways of\u000aappreciating or motivating their students. Many traditional gurus are deeply\u000aproud of their disciples\u2019 achievements but are rarely effusive in their praise.\u000aI remember as a teenager taking a what I thought was a brilliant diving catch\u000ain an intercollegiate match back in the 1960s and everyone praising me to the\u000askies\u2014except my young uncle who was playing for our opponents the Madras\u000aChristian College. In the evening, on our way home he said to me, \u2018Anda catch\u000anee sumara pidichaeda (Roughly, \u201cThat was not a bad catch by you\u201d).\u2019 </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Later I had the privilege of playing with some great captains\u000aand mentors in cricket. My Hyderabad skipper ML Jaisimha was one such senior\u000awho rarely praised me. Actually the closest he came to doing so was when he\u000acursed me for doing something wrong and followed up with \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this\u000afrom you of all people!\u2019 High praise! </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I never did ask Jayashri about Balamani\u2019s approach to this\u000aaspect of the guru-sishya relationship, but I can guess that she was perhaps a\u000alittle softer in her approach without going overboard with praise. I know that\u000ashe is enormously proud of all her wards who have distinguished themselves in\u000adifferent fields. We all know how gifted and accomplished Shankar Mahadevan is,\u000awhat a mature vocalist Raji Gopalakrishnan is. Prasanna Venkatraman is one of\u000aour bright young stars, as we all saw from his nuanced, bhava-rich singing\u000atoday\u2014and of course Jayashri. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">To me even more important than these well known performers\u000aare the many genuine rasika-musicians she has produced, the people who have a\u000aday job but can do their guru proud whenever they sing in informal settings. I\u000aknow how sensitively Sabesh can sing, how aesthetically genuine Mala Mohan\u2019s\u000ainvolvement in music is. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Going back to the Bombay school of Carnatic music, I must\u000atest your patience with yet another reference to cricket. In my playing days,\u000aBombay was the most formidable team in India\u2014don\u2019t be misled by the way Mumbai\u000aIndians are playing these days. Visiting players were sometimes treated with\u000acontempt. I remember suffering from an upset tummy and asking for buttermilk at\u000alunchtime on a hot day at Wankhede Stadium, and the official telling me rudely, "Not on the menu!"&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">In Carnatic\u000amusic, the story was different, and every musician, from Bombay Sisters to\u000aPrasanna Venkatraman had to migrate to Madras if they wanted to make it big.\u000aThe story was however quite different when it came to teaching. Bombay produced,\u000aand continues to produce some of the finest Carnatic music gurus.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">All these wonderful teachers have had one thing in common:\u000athe absolute love and support they enjoyed from their families\u2014parents who\u000aencouraged them, spouses who stood by them, children whom they nurtured. These\u000agurus also shared these precious family bonds with their students and their\u000afamilies to create an unusual network that transcends all manner of\u000abarriers\u2014geographical, language, even genres. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 125%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Carnatic music is indeed indebted to these exports from Tamil\u000aNadu. Thanks to the reverse brain drain that has been taking place in recent\u000ayears we are now able to say today, welcome back Smt TR Balamani. May you\u000acontinue your great work for years and years at Chennai.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
