Janaki</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>&nbsp;</b><br />This is a little story of a musical experiment, a true one, which throws light on people\u2019s priorities, taste and perception. It raises several questions too:</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />$ In a common-place environment, at an inconvenient or inappropriate hour, do we perceive beauty?</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />$ If so, do we stop to appreciate it?</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />$ Do we recognise talent in an unexpected context? In Washington, DC, at a Metro Station, on a cold January morning in 2007, this man with a violin played six Bach pieces for about 45 minutes.&nbsp; During that time, approximately 2,000 people went through the station, most of them on their way to work.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><i>About 3 minutes:</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The violinist received his first dollar. A woman threw money in the hat and, without stopping, continued to walk.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><i>At 6 minutes:</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />A young man leaned against the wall to listen to him, then looked at his watch and started to walk again.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><i>At 45 minutes:</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The musician played continuously. Only six people stopped and listened for a short while. About 20 gave money but continued to walk at their normal pace. The man collected a total of $ 32.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><i>After one hour:</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />He finished playing and there was silence. No one noticed and no one applauded. There was no recognition at all.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />No one knew this, but the violinist was Joshua Bell, one of the greatest musicians in the world. He played one of the most intricate pieces ever written, with a violin worth $ 3.5 million dollars. Two days before, Joshua Bell sold-out a theater in Boston where the seats averaged $ 100 each to sit and listen to him play the same music.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Joshua Bell, playing incognito in the D.C. Metro Station, was organised by the <i>Washington Post</i> as part of a social experiment about perception, taste and people\u2019s priorities.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><i><b>Food for thought:</b></i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Coming to our very own Chennai season, you now wonder \u2013 can you blame the members of the audience for getting up after the clock strikes eight to go to their homes far and near? Can you blame them for slinking out of the hall for a cup of hot tea or coffee with sizzling snacks after being chilled to the bone by the A/C blast? Or when they rush out for a break after a hi-decibel onslaught?</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
