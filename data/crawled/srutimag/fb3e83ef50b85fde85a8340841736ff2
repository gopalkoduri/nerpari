The artists, Sheikh Subhani Mahboob and his wife Khaleeshabibi Mahaboob say they need at least three hours for a concert as it takes time for the wood wind instruments to settle down in these dry and cold conditions. And they cannot practise and warm up the instruments in their hotel room for fear of disturbing the other guests.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The mood created by the talented duo was contemplative throughout. The Natakurinji varnam preceded Hamsadhwani and Dwijavanti <i>(Akhilandeshwari).</i> <i>Sogasuga mridanga talamu</i> in Sriranjani was accompanied with a soft touch on the tavil. The Todi alapana was expansive and in the grand tradition of their guru Sheikh Chinna Moulana. They executed the difficult piece <i>Chesinadella marachitivo O Rama Rama</i> with a precision not found in many vocal concerts. The nagaswaram seemed to virtually speak the lyrics out aloud.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Many senior artistes were in the audience enjoying this soul fest\u2014T.R. Subramaniam, T.N. Krishnan, T.M. Krishna, Ramnad Raghavan, and Guruvayur Dorai among them. During the tani, Vembu Muthukumar and Manickam Sankar showed their dexterity demonstrating that the tavil could be played softly and produce sounds of exceptional nuance and resonance. They ended the concert with the ten Bhaja Govindam verses in the ragamalika popularized by M.S. Subbulakshmi. Again one could sense the nagaswarams\u2019 chaste enunciation of the Sanskrit verses of Adi Sankara.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Here was a Muslim couple playing Hindu religious music. The box that held the nagaswaram had pictures of Hindu gods. The couple were the asthana vidwans of the Sringeri Peetham. I was curious to know more about how this husband and wife team was introduced to this music. Did they know the words of the songs they play so soulfully? Do Hindu rituals also enter their lives at home?</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">We caught up with the artists backstage. The soft spoken, unassuming couple and the equally modest and quiet tavil duo sat down and spoke in a Tamil not adulterated with the usual English vocabulary.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Do you remember how you started to learn nagaswaram?</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I was five or six years old when my father started including me in the lessons he gave other students. By age ten I was playing at concerts with my father. She (he indicates his wife sitting by his side with an affectionate nod) is my own Athai\u2019s daughter. She was taught by her chittappa and by age nine she was also giving concerts.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">How were you able to wield such a big instrument when you were so young?</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">We learned on a smaller nagaswaram. Within a couple of years we were able to play the full-sized instrument.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">How did you come to be introduced into this life of playing religious Hindu music?</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a</span></i></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xLbLFO3IhDM/T5JPZMfS5tI/AAAAAAAAAcU/QDn5L-ITjLQ/s1600/Sheikh+Subhani+Mahaboob.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="292" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xLbLFO3IhDM/T5JPZMfS5tI/AAAAAAAAAcU/QDn5L-ITjLQ/s320/Sheikh+Subhani+Mahaboob.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Our families have a story about this (he says with a smile) that is written in our family record book. It may or may not be true, but it is our family history. Eight generations ago one of our grandparents was a young boy in Saathulur in Guntur district. The boy did not do well in his lessons and his father punished him with a beating. He ran away from home in pain and hid in the nearby Munivandamma temple. That night, the Amman deity of the temple appeared before the boy and comforted him. It is said that she wrote a mantra on his tongue and blessed him with the gift of nagaswaram music, not only for his lifetime but also for the next seven generations to come. The seventh generation ended with my father. We are the eighth generation <i>(smiles coyly).</i> So we now pray to receive the blessing for the next seven generations.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Do you learn the music as swaras or do you also learn the sahitya?</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">We have to learn the words. <i>Paattu</i> cannot be learned and played by just learning the swaras. We are trained in vocal music and have learned all the pieces we play.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">What religious traditions do you observe at home?</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">For us, all religions are one, but at home we observe the Muslim holidays and traditions. Our marriage was a traditional Muslim ceremony. However, my father asked me to tie the tali myself. Normally this is not done as the groom rarely meets the bride before the wedding, and the elderly of the house tie the knot. We were the first to set this trend and since then, all the youngsters in our family do it. At that time it was a big thing.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Are you satisfied with your concert today?</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">No <i>(quickly with feeling).</i> We had a lot of trouble with the dry and cold weather. The sivali (the removable mouthpiece for the nagaswaram) gets dry and it takes time to settle down. It is made from the leaves of the <i>naanal thattai</i> bush that grows along the banks of the Kaveri. The leaves are picked, steamed and dried and then the sivalis are made. If you buy a dozen, only three or four will be usable.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">You say the art of playing the nagaswaram is going through a revival now with many colleges teaching the instrument in Tamil Nadu. What about the art of making nagaswarams?</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Nagaswarams are made from the wood of the <i>accha maram.</i> It is very hard to find today. Beams from old houses being demolished are scavenged to make new instruments. It is a dark wood. The dark color of the nagaswaram is the natural color of the wood itself. All nagaswarams are made in Narsingapettai near Mayavaram where a family of two brothers are continuing their tradition of generations.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Written in April 2004)</span></i></div></div>
