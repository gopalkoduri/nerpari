His talent is hardly surprising as he is the grandson of senior flute vidwan and Sangeet Natak Akademi awardee TS Sankaran, a disciple of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_28.html" target="_blank">TR Mahalingam,</a> the man who revolutionised the pullankuzhal tradition.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aToday a promising&nbsp; young concert musician, Jayanth has received much praise not only for his&nbsp; knowledge and creativity but also his fingering and blowing technique, which enables him to switch smoothly between the normal and bass varieties of the instrument. Jayanth also has a keen understanding of raga swaroopa and sensitive feel for the lyrics of the kritis he plays.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aJayanth was barely four when his late grandmother vidushi VS Sundari gave him his first music lessons. His grandfather started him on flute learning when he was five, embracing him in a particularly warm guru-sishya relationship.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aIn addition to being a regular at sabha cutcheris, Jayanth is also frequently featured on radio and television. He has been accompanied by many senior violinists like M Chandrasekharan, Dwaram Mangathayaru, Vittal Ramamurthy, Sikkil Bhaskaran and S Varadarajan and percussionists of the calibre of Guruvayur Durai, Tiruvarur Bhakthavatsalam and the late Vellore Ramabhadran.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aJayanth has won a number of honours including the awards of Best Instrumentalist at the Music Academy and Carnatic Idol of the Year 2007 from Carnatica and Raghalaya Trust, and a Ministry of Culture scholarship. He has been featured in three CD albums.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aJayanth appears to be a young man with eclectic tastes, enjoying listening to good music beyond his own Carnatic tradition, a positive factor in the popular tukkada segments of his concerts.</div></div>
