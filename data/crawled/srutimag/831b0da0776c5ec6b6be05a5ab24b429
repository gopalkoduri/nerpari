They not only learnt some rare kritis from the master teacher but also got to experience his generosity, wit, and wisdom.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cTeaching is very close to my heart,\u201d says TVG. \u201cI love being with these children, having fun with them, making them come alive, and bringing out their personality through music. I want them to see that our Indian music has so much life in it. What does it not have to offer? I have taught in so many cities in India and around the world. Bhavan in London is one of the few places that offer a conducive atmosphere where I feel inspired to share the glory of our music - not just the technicalities but music as enjoyment and a pleasurable experience.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The workshop attendees have been given a strong foundation in Carnatic music designed at the Bhavan by Sivasakti Sivanesan, a leading Indian music teacher and performer in the United Kingdom. Says TVG, \u201cMy job was simply to embellish and give the final touches to songs that Sivasakti has painstakingly taught to these students over the last few months. She has put in a lot of thought and effort to train her students in the Chembai tradition that emphasizes purity in sruti, bhava, enunciation, sahitya and rasa. I am impressed with the high standard of music here in London and the commitment of parents and children to undergo such strain to make sure to attend this intensive week-long workshop despite all their other activities.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<br />\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a</div>\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zRFR9HqZGs8/Up2IQ3f2C_I/AAAAAAAAEBc/lnbWcJlXqww/s1600/DSC_8385.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zRFR9HqZGs8/Up2IQ3f2C_I/AAAAAAAAEBc/lnbWcJlXqww/s320/DSC_8385.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">TVG picked some simple yet beautiful nottuswarasahityams of Dikshitar such as <i>Santatampahimam</i> and <i>Varasiva balam</i> apart from his own composition called <i>Arunachalame</i> in the raga Sivaranjani to teach the children. Based on the request of the workshop attendees, he also included a moving and meaningful Hindustani bhajan <i>Nirdhanko</i> by Kabirdas in the agenda, thus teaching the children the differences between the two main systems of Indian classical music.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Every session was dotted with TVG Sir\u2019s anecdotes and interesting stories about his guru, Chembai. He told us about how Chembai lost his voice for about eight years and got it back miraculously. Another story was on how Chembai\u2019s rendition of a particular song led to heavy downpour just as he had warned his audience who had insisted on him singing the raga.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">TVG offered many tips to students on voice culture, aural sensitivity, spiritual aspects of music, the significance of the guru-sishya relationship, balancing music with other activities, and the different types of gamakas used in Carnatic music. He shared them with much generosity, sincerity, and caring for the students in a loving and patient manner. Overall, it was an unforgettable week of intense learning that left us students feeling inspired, energized, and very grateful.</span></div>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
