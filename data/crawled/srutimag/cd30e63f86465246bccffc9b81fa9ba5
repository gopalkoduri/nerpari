And thereby hangs a tale that we\u2019ll come to later in this account</span>.</div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Srinivasa Iyer was one of eleven children. The Sankara Srautigal family lived in the tiny village of Angarai on the bank of the river Kaveri, very close to Srinivasan\u2019s place of birth. Of the eleven children, three went on to pursue careers related to Carnatic music. Angarai Viswanatha Bhagavatar performed Harikatha, AS Panchapakesa Iyer wrote books on music and Trichy Raghavan became a mridanga vidwan.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">It was Srinivasan\u2019s deep interest in music as a member of the local bhajana groups that led to his first guru nagaswara vidwan Sivanandam Pillai taking him to Alathur Venkatesa Iyer, who had a formidable reputation as a music teacher. Srinivasan was only 12 then. He was to spend the next 12 years in gurukulavasam.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Venkatesa Iyer\u2019s family had moved from their native Tiruvaiyaru to Alathur, where he acquired a rich repertoire of kritis. In time, Venkatesa Iyer shifted to Trichy, where he taught many students, some of whom went on to achieve success on the concert platform, or in the movies, as in the case of MK Tyagaraja Bhagavatar. Chengalpattu Ranganathan achieved greater fame as a teacher than as a performer. His son Sivasubramania Iyer or Subba Iyer and Srinivasa Iyer were to team up as possibly the greatest duo combination in Carnatic music as the Alathur Brothers. It is of course obvious that they were not siblings. The Brothers debuted at the Tyagabrahma Utsavam organised at Kanchipuram by Naina Pillai. The boys had been recommended by the venerable Kumbakonam Dakshinamurti Pillai.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The Alathur Brothers became famous for their mastery of the rhythmic aspect of music, their complex ragam-tanam-pallavi renderings, and their expertise in Tiruppugazh. To learn the intricacies of pallavis in chhanda talas and conquer the challenge of Tiruppugazh, they made a sabbatical visit to the Madras home of mridanga wizard Palani Subramaniam. They were so adept at these arts that they gave exclusive Tiruppugazh concerts. <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_29.html" target="_blank">Palghat Mani Iyer</a> was an admirer and willing accompanist of the Brothers.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The Music Academy originally announced the 1964 Sangita Kalanidhi award to Srinivasa Iyer, who insisted his guru\u2019s son should first be so honoured. With Subba Iyer demurring, the problem was resolved by a draw of lots, which favoured the younger Subba Iyer. Srinivasa Iyer was to receive the award the following year, but before that Subba Iyer passed away. Srinivasa Iyer accepted his award with a heavy heart, but satisfied that his guru\u2019s son had preceded him.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Srinivasa Iyer performed solo for the next 16 years, much encouraged by the support of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_29.html" target="_blank">Palghat Mani Iyer</a>. His first concert without his erstwhile partner was at a Pillaiyar temple at Tanjavur, accompanied by Lalgudi Jayaraman and <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_29.html" target="_blank">Palghat Mani Iyer</a>. He was a caring teacher, who guided the likes of Chengalpattu Ranganathan, Tiruppunturutti Venkatesan and Bangalore Vijayalakshmi.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">It was said of Srinivasa Iyer that music was his life and that Tyagaraja kritis were his worship. With a vast repertoire, he sang in a structured manner, unmindful of the need for applause on stage. He was an advocate of proportion and balance in concert music. Self-effacing to a fault, he did not believe in promoting his career. He was respectful and supportive of his accompanists all his life. He and his wife Parvati, daughter of Valadi Krishna Iyer, had five children.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
