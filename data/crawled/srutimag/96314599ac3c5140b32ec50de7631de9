The person behind the success of the Narayana Teerthar Aradhana is vidwan TV Venkatesan. This octogenarian musician has been perseveringly holding the Aradhana for almost five decades. When he speaks about the Thirupoonthurthy Aradhana, he speaks with a passion and unflinching determination for popularizing the compositions of Narayana Teerthar and the <i>Krishna Leela Tarangini,</i> in both cities and villages.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />It is an interesting incident how Venkatesan began this long and arduous but rewarding and fulfilling journey. In the year 1964, he sang at the Madras Music Academy. After his concert, the Secretary of the Academy, Dr V Raghavan, called him and asked him about the festival which his father, was conducting at the \u2018Guruswamy Madom\u2019. He then urged Venkatesan to continue this tradition and conduct a grand festival every year to celebrate the compositions of Narayana Teerthar.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The next year, TV Venkatesan conducted his first festival, with Dr. Raghavan inaugurating it. That year, stalwarts such as <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music.html" target="_blank">Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar</a> and <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_14.html" target="_blank">Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer</a> performed at the festival, which was a runaway success. In the years to come, several musicians performed at the festival. Venkatesan recalls fondly how musician Madurai Somasundaram (Madurai Somu as he was known) would begin singing at 7 PM, and go on until midnight \u2013 singing to a rapt audience.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Over the years, several star musicians such as <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_18.html" target="_blank">MS Subbalakshmi,</a> <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_11.html" target="_blank">DK Pattamal,</a> <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_06.html" target="_blank">ML Vasanathakumari,</a> <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_04.html" target="_blank">KV Narayanaswamy</a> performed under its auspices, to eager audiences.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cwJcJHEbVSg/UcQiDAu4ezI/AAAAAAAADfM/DPRHHb7wigY/s1600/TP+4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cwJcJHEbVSg/UcQiDAu4ezI/AAAAAAAADfM/DPRHHb7wigY/s320/TP+4.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">1988, in TV Venkatesan\u2019s words, was a turning point in the activities of the Trust. <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_18.html" target="_blank">MS Subbalakshmi</a> sang at Thirupoonthurthy. This was a grand concert \u2013 people poured in from villages nearby, senior advocates came in from Thanjavur, for those who were not able to make it \u2013 All India Radio broadcast the concert live, all over the country.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cThere is no musician who has not sung in our Aradhana\u201d, says TV Venkatesan. \u201cWe are truly happy to have had such unflinching support from musicians across generations.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />My Guru, Smt. Neela Ramgopal, who was the Chief Guest for the Aradhana in 2011, says \u2013 \u201cPerforming at the festival is beautiful \u2013 we can see the <i>vigraham</i> of Lord Krishna in front of us, and just lose ourselves in the music\u201d.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />For me, performing at the Aradhana was truly a divine experience. As we enter Thirupoonthurthy, we are welcomed by the family, who are outstanding hosts \u2013 and are taken to the Narayana Teertha Brindavanam. We pay homage to the great composer at the Mantapam and the temple. The stage setting is stunning \u2013 behind us and on either side, are rows of endless paddy fields; in front of us, we see the idol of Lord Krishna, and the Samadhi of Narayana Teerthar. I take a moment to absorb the serenity of the moment, and then begin to sing <i>Nandagopala krishnam, nanda akhilam,</i> and feel that Lord Krishna is looking at us, and sending us his blessing.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b><i>Nidle Shibira, Nidle, Dakshina Karnataka</i></b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b><i>\u2018The children practice till 2 AM in the morning, they do not sleep until they get every sangathi right - This is truly Art for Art\u2019s sake\u2026\u2026.\u2019</i></b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ntQXNk3E9ek/UcQilNn-V5I/AAAAAAAADfc/-mndHdTbnDI/s1600/Nidle+3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="228" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ntQXNk3E9ek/UcQilNn-V5I/AAAAAAAADfc/-mndHdTbnDI/s320/Nidle+3.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Thirteen years ago, violinist Vittal Ramamurthy was inspired to return to his native place, and introduce a week-long music festival that would expose students of music from neighbouring towns such as Mangalore, Sringeri, Puttur and Udipi to the best music and workshops by great musicians, an interaction which would have otherwise impossible for many. Thus the Annual <i>Shibira</i> was born, at his hometown of Nidle in Karnataka.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The Nidle Shibira is an initiative that is truly unique. It is exemplary. Vocalist Vijay Siva, who has conducted many workshops at the Shibira avers, \u201cwhat Vittal Ramamurthy does, is indeed what every musician should do. He goes back to his roots, he gives back to his native village \u2013 it is <i>Paropakaaram</i> (social service, helping others), in the truest sense\u201d.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The Nidle Shibira, held every year in May \u2013 is a week-long workshop for students of music. Over the course of the week, hundreds of students gain insights into about various aspects of music \u2013 raga &amp; laya aspects, vocal and instrumental music, compositions of various Vaggeyakaras, and so on. It does not end there \u2013 for the entire week, Vittal Ramamurthy\u2019s family provides accommodation, food and refreshments to students and their parents, without charging any amount for the workshop, food or accommodation.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cThe inspiration for the Shibira was from my mother Krishnaveni and sister Rajeshwari Bhatt. The festival has grown in size year on year, and we are grateful to all the musicians who have participated in the Shibira in each of the thirteen years. It is the commitment of the children that motivates us to do this every year\u201d, is what Sri Vittal Ramamurthy said when asked about what motivates him to undertake this mammoth task every year.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Given such a golden opportunity, the students of music absorb every little nuance, every sentence that is uttered during the workshops. They listen, assimilate and imbibe in rapt attention. Vocalist G Ravikiran, who conducted a workshop on the compositions of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_2206.html" target="_blank">Muthusvamy Dikshithar</a> at this year\u2019s Shibira, says \u2013 \u201cOn the second day of the Shibira, I stayed with the children \u2013 it was truly incredible to see them practicing until 2 AM in the morning\u2026 they would not rest until they got every single <i>sangathi</i> correct. <i>They were practicing not because they had a concert or a competition to prepare for \u2013 they were practicing because they loved it \u2013 this is the purest example of Art for Art\u2019s sake.\u201d</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i></i>Vijay Siva adds, \u201cThe ambience is truly incredible \u2013 the workshop is held in Vittal Ramamurthy\u2019s ancestral house \u2013 you are surrounded by nature, you eat organic food, it is quiet and peaceful \u2013 it takes you back and gives you a glimpse of how life must have been 150 years ago. I went to the Shibira a few years back, but the memory still remains fresh, it is one of my most cherished experiences.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-D_LMNfZ14iw/UcQiSkluaaI/AAAAAAAADfU/2zBWO6miNO0/s1600/Nidle+2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-D_LMNfZ14iw/UcQiSkluaaI/AAAAAAAADfU/2zBWO6miNO0/s320/Nidle+2.jpg" width="320" /></a><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Over the past thirteen years, musicians such as Vijay Siva, TM Krishna, Bombay Jayashri, Neyveli Santhanagopalan, S Sowmya, G Ravikiran, S Saketharaman, among others, have conducted workshops at the Shibira. This year, Mridangam Legend Vidwan <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">Umayalapuram K Sivaraman</a> inaugurated the festival, and conduced exhaustive sessions.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />A typical day at the Shibira would be \u2013 waking up in the morning, eating a wholesome natural meal, practicing until the first workshop begins, then spending the entire day in the company of great musicians learning until dinner, after which practice late into the night\u2026 Vittal Ramamurthy says, \u201cIt takes us a month to prepare for the week-long Shibira. At the end of it, we feel so refreshed and re-energized. We have a wonderful community of our family, friends and musicians. We look forward to May every year.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The Shibira is an experience that is pure and truly amazing. Vittal Ramamurthy and his family, year after year, provide hundreds of children an opportunity to immerse in music, this is an experience that is truly, beautiful, pure and humbling.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b><i><br />(The author is a young vocalist from Bangalore and disciple of vidushi Neela Ramgopal)</i></b></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
