This realisation coincided with another message from Nethra, <i>\u2018Fifteen minutes late!\u2019</i> His brisk walk graduated to a trot and soon turned into a sprint. He crossed a set of shopping complexes\u2014typical Pondy Bazaar complexes with lots of small shops that sold fake mobile phone accessories (selling Noika, Panasoanic, Philiphs and other misleading brands), computer parts, cheap clothes, expensive clothes, cheap glasses, expensive glasses, housed a watch mechanic or a photo-framer (\u2018God Pictures and All Other Kinds of Framing\u2019), a \u2018mens only\u2019 barber (with a/c and \u2018style cutting and cropping\u2019), and a dry cleaner (\u2018Devi Dry Cleaners - Clean as White\u2019). At the next intersection, he stopped at a <i>potti kadai</i> and asked for directions to Big Bazaar. The man, his mouth filled with <i>paan,</i> pointed in a general direction without saying anything. Ajith ran past a petrol bunk, crossed what seemed like a small intersection that couldn\u2019t handle the traffic and spotted the rather aptly named Big Bazaar on his left. Nethra had given him only vague directions, \u201cIt\u2019s a juice shop. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s called \u2013 either before or after Big Bazaar. I\u2019m not sure. Oh wait. I think it is after. Because I usually walk along the flower market to get there... No. Wait... I think it is before. I\u2019m confusing it with the flower market image... Actually, I have no clue. Just get to the Big Bazaar and find the nearest juice shop.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAs it turned out, the shop was behind the flower market, after Big Bazaar.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aNethra was there, her juice nearly finished. She pointed to the clock on her phone as soon as he reached. He muttered an apology to which she said, \u201cEvery time.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHey,\u201d Ajith protested, \u201cI have an excuse today. These musicians talk too much.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aNethra smiled. She was about to say something when the waiter arrived at their table. \u201cWatermelon juice,\u201d Ajith declared.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWatermelon not there, <i>saar.</i>\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith peered into the menu and spotted a \u20185-fruits cocktail\u2019 and promptly ordered it. The waiter replied, \u201cOnly four fruits today. Watermelon not there.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aNethra laughed, \u201cSo drink four fruits cocktail...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThey looked at the waiter, who, after consideration, said, \u201cSaar, billing will still be for five fruits cocktail.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith said, \u201cWhat a place you\u2019ve picked!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHeh. They let you sit here for as long as you want.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith took a sip of her juice.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cSo,\u201d Nethra asked, \u201cHow\u2019d the interview go?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cOh, awesome. He\u2019s the strangest person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHow?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cGenerally. He\u2019s mysterious, but makes it clear to you that he is mysterious. He wants you to know that there are secrets, but he will not tell you what they are.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cLike what?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cSo, I asked him about his early gurus. Wait. Let me play you the recording of his answer...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cGurus!\u201d Mani\u2019s voice crackled through the little recorder, \u201cThere were so many. I used to sing with a drama company, you know. Two or three men there knew a lot of Tyagaraja kritis. They were Saurashtra people from Salem, and claimed to be somehow related to the Venkataramana Bhagavatar family. I learnt from them.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cTheir names?\u201d Ajith asked.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t even remember. I only called them \u2018Mama\u2019.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhat was the name of the drama company?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cSeetapati Drama Company.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith paused the recording, \u201cThat is wrong. He was in the Sri Karthikeya Nataka Sangam. I got two references for that, including an article in a coffee table book that reproduced an old handbill. That\u2019s what I\u2019m telling you. He\u2019s being cagey about really random things.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHe might have been in more than one drama company.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI checked with people who knew him. He wasn\u2019t.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHe may have forgotten \u2013 he\u2019s really old, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHe\u2019s old; he can barely sit. He\u2019s completely bedridden. Yes. But he\u2019s fully aware and alert. Absolutely sane. There\u2019s nothing wrong with his mind.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aNethra paused for a moment before asking, \u201cHe might have learnt from someone really big. But he thinks this \u2018self-taught\u2019 myth makes him cooler.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s a likely theory!\u201d Ajith scoffed, \u201cListen on.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cIt was strange, you know,\u201d Mani continued, \u201cthese teachers didn\u2019t know any theory in music. They didn\u2019t even know basic things like which swaras came in what ragas! But they sang the kritis perfectly. They would never, for instance, sing a Kedaragowlai gamakam in Yadukulakambhoji, or Manji gamakam in Bhairavi.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cBut how did you learn the, um... swara-structure of those ragas then?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cBy listening to concerts! It was all subconscious. I don\u2019t think I understood what I sang back then. I just sang. I must\u2019ve made many mistakes, but people never told me anything... Except Musiri.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhat about Musiri?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHe heard my private concert at a lawyer\u2019s house, and asked me to visit him the next day. I went, early in the morning, and found him waiting for me. He asked me to sing two kritis I sang the previous evening. He stopped me at almost each line and pointed out something wrong \u2013the raga lakshana, lyrics, or gamaka. I was humbled. He said to me, still smiling, \u2018I know you have not finished school, and you are too old to go back now. But I can make an exception for you at the Central College of Carnatic Music.\u2019\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHe even found a patron to pay fees, and give me a monthly stipend. I was overjoyed. I spent a few great months immersed in music, not worrying about earning a living, travelling or dealing with my father\u2019s constant threats. I spent my days reading theory and history, and my evenings singing till my throat went hoarse. My world was filled with only young musicians discovering their art.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cBut this happiness didn\u2019t last. The same company I enjoyed began getting on my nerves. People were always telling me what to do and what not to do. This is allowed. That is not. This is correct. That is wrong. They never enjoyed the music for what it was. Is it music or a bureaucratic procedure? How can anything be disallowed? They always judged everything. I couldn\u2019t handle it. Those discussions... On what is tradition and what is lakshana and lakshya and all that. Mostly, people didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, but they would talk and argue incessantly.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI went back to Musiri and said I wanted to leave. He laughed and told me to concentrate on my exams.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a(There was a pause when Shankar walked in with two tumblers of steaming coffee and a few Marie biscuits on a plate).</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI didn\u2019t really appreciate the value of theory back then. Which was a bit of a setback as far as my music was concerned. But it allowed me to explore, you know...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cNot be bound by what books say,\u201d Shankar helped him.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYeah,\u201d Mani agreed, \u201cI hated books. I used to think, \u2018What can a book teach you about Bhairavi ragam that listening to good music can\u2019t teach you?\u2019\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith was curious. \u201cI heard from someone that you stole many books from the library when you ran away.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani laughed, \u201cBooks were being stolen from that library all the time. I was just a convenient person to pin it down on! Because I was the rebel. I was the crazy one. And I disappeared!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cBut where did you go?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cNowhere in particular. I just wandered around.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShankar looked on curiously, and Ajith was still formulating his next question to prod Mani along when the doorbell rang. Shankar got up and went to the door.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cCan you elaborate a little more?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani laughed again, \u201cYou\u2019re asking questions like a policeman!\u201d Ajith smiled wryly. Mani said, \u201cI wandered all over South India. I sang a song or two in return for a meal. I used to get into trains, and when I found a place that took my fancy, I got off. I went to that village and spent time with people there. Sometimes a week, sometimes two. I sang for them at night, taught them small songs, learnt their music from them. Then I took another train in another direction.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith wasn\u2019t convinced of this revenue model, but he didn\u2019t ask Mani about it. Ajith ignored them and asked, \u201cYou must\u2019ve met very interesting people.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cMusicians! I met such wonderful musicians all over the place. So unlike today when everyone gravitates towards Madras. For instance, I spent six months in a small village near Kundapur, in what is Karnataka today. There was an ashram of sorts by the sea. Lovely place to practise. And no one there knew me. I sourced a tambura from a musician nearby who took a fancy for my music. He hadn\u2019t even heard of me. He was an odd Tulu man, Raghavendra or something, who had learnt music from all sorts of sources - from books people brought him when they came back from Madras or Mysore, from musicians who were visiting his part of the world for concerts, from people he called \u2018wanderers\u2019 who knew lots of songs. There was a doctor in Udupi who studied medicine in Madras, who knew a lot of music. This man would go there to learn kritis from him. He knew so many compositions that the Madras scene had no idea of \u2013 in Kannada, Tamil, Telugu and even Malayalam.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI think he understood music by just sitting with his tambura and singing, you know. He used to tell me that he would take a raga and sing it for weeks. Because he had so little guidance, his ideas were often quirky, but it\u2019s surprising how often he reached the same traditional melodic structures and gamakas. I understood then that there was an intuitive logic to every little aspect of Carnatic music. No raga was a random collection of phrases, each aspect of it had a deeper meaning than I earlier suspected. You have no idea how many doors this revelation unlocked. It convinced me of the infinite potential of my art. At twenty-three, it gave my life new meaning.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aJust then, Ajith\u2019s phone rang. His grandmother was calling. He paused the recording, and said, \u201cPaati!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cAre you coming home for dinner?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHis grandmother was only concerned about one aspect of his life \u2013 where, when and what Ajith would eat. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now. I will see you in twenty minutes.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cOkay. Tell me, what did they make you do at the magazine today?\u201d she asked.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhat?\u201d Ajith was surprised by the question.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhat did you do today at work?\u201d she said, slightly louder this time.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThe usual, Paati. Some editing and this and that.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI\u2019m asking, because someone called on the landline. Some student of N. V. Mani said you left your notebook in his house.\u201d Her tone changed when she asked, \u201cYou\u2019ve been visiting N. V. Mani?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith became a little nervous, \u201cNo, Paati! That must\u2019ve been some wrong number.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cBut he asked for Ajith Ramachandran.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aNow Ajith was trapped. He said, \u201cNo, no. There\u2019s some confusion. My, my\u2026 colleague was using my notebook.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShe was not convinced, \u201cI hope you aren\u2019t going looking for dead stories.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cPaati. No.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith disconnected the call and stared blankly into the mid-distance. Nethra asked, \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cNothing. Listen to this part of the recording.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhen did you decide to come back?\u201d Ajith\u2019s voice said, through the little speaker.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI didn\u2019t decide,\u201d Mani replied, \u201cThe decision was made for me.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYour marriage was fixed?\u201d Shankar asked.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cShhh. That was much later. This is a long story, and it involves a woman.\u201d Mani\u2019s eyes grew larger as he spoke about her, \u201cShe was wonderful. Almost as tall as me, slightly dark, with black eyes lined with kohl, long hair, her body fuller than her age... I saw her on the Madurai railway station platform. She was sitting on a large suitcase and eating something from a tiffin box. I usually avoided towns, preferred getting off when the train stopped for a signal between stations, but I made an exception for her and got down at Madurai.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cShe was that beautiful?\u201d Ajith asked this time.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cShe was extremely beautiful. And her feet were tapping a beat on the platform \u2013 in perfect Khandachapu talam! <i>Taka-takita, taka-takita\u2026\u201d</i></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cDid you speak to her?\u201d Shankar asked.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani didn\u2019t reply.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShankar asked him the same question again. This time, Mani said, with a twinkle, \u201cI did a lot more!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(<a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/08/sruti-fiction_2.html" target="_blank">To be continued</a>)</span></b> </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a<b>Disclaimer: This is a work of fiction, with fictional characters.
