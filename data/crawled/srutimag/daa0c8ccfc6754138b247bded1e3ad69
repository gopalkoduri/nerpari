He is a rare human being, a genuine lover of music who knows how to  celebrate music and musicians and has for years silently supported the  music he loves. When I last visited him, he was recovering from a long  and debilitating succession of illnesses. At the best of times a  slightly built man, now he was skin and bones, looking frail and  helpless, curled up in his bed. He was deeply depressed; his poor health  had rendered him so. Just home from a long spell at a nursing home, he  was convalescing, but the path to total recovery was slow and arduous.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a</span> <span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The  one thing that kept Eswar going through this period of sickness and  rehabilitation was Carnatic music. There were three little cassette  recorders on his bed placed at different positions, so that he could  reach for one of them without exerting himself, whichever way he had  turned as he tossed around restlessly. Wonderful music was flowing from  one of the players on the day I visited him - a recording of a sixties  cutcheri of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-of-indian-classical-music.html" target="_blank">Semmangudi Srinivasier, </a>T N Krishnan and<a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_29.html" target="_blank"> Palghat Mani Iyer.</a></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a</span> <span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Until  a few months earlier, Eswar's small ground floor flat was the regular  venue of chamber concerts he arranged every month. A must on his monthly  calendar was a recital by P S Narayanaswami, a fine vocalist from the  <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-of-indian-classical-music.html" target="_blank">Semmangudi</a> stable, and one of the most liked and sought after teachers  among today's young stars as well as aspiring young musicians. At these  intimate performances by 'Pichai Sir' as he is known to one and all, the  audience list usually reads like a roll call of honour at the Music  Academy. Regular listeners include Sanjay Subrahmanyan and his wife,  Unnikrishnan, Vijay Siva, Manoj Siva, Sriramkumar, Shashank and his  family, Ranjani and Gayatri and their parents, Eswar himself and a  number of PSN's disciples, besides the two providing vocal accompaniment  on the day.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a</span> <span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">There is much interaction between the performers and  the audience, with the musicians among them sitting within handshaking  distance of the artists and encouraging by gesture and voluble  appreciation. Often it's a case of Listeners' Choice and the opportunity  to listen to certain nuances of particular compositions or ways of  improvisation unique to his school. While the whole experience is  emotionally satisfying for the lay listener, for the musicians,  accompanying as well as listening, it is an academic exercise as well,  serving to help fine-tune certain aspects of their music.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a</span> <span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Eswar  has been organising these concerts with great love and care, often  making his own requests as to the composition of the performance.  Besides Pichai Sir, other musicians who regularly attend these soirees  have also performed at Eswar's drawing room. I have heard memorable  recitals by T M Krishna and Sanjay Subrahmanyam there for instance. The  audience is usually around 25-30 in number and can on occasion fall  below ten, but that has never made any difference to the quality of  music at this very special venue.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a</span> <span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Though a south Indian, Eswar  was born abroad as were his parents, and shifted permanently to India  only in the recent past. Hailing from a family rich in music, he is  himself a trained musician and has a very sound knowledge of music  theory. A professional in the service sector, he retired a few years ago  following a setback in health. A frequent visitor to Madras during the  music season in the years past, he decided to settle down here and could  be seen regularly at concerts, before his recent illness.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a</span> <span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I was  delighted to see Eswar at a small temple concert a couple of weeks ago.  He could not stay till the end as he grew very tired, but he was totally  absorbed in the music while there. The day he recovers fully and goes  back to his regular routine, the many musicians who like and respect him  will be happy for him -- and Carnatic music."</span></div></div></div>
