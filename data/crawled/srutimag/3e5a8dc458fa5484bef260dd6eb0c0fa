As Sangita Kalanidhi R Vedavalli states in her\u000aappreciation of the vidushi, Sudha wears her success lightly, despite all the\u000apopularity she enjoys across continents. Visible during our recent interactions\u000awith her were her quiet enjoyment of the prospect of arguably the greatest day\u000aof her music career, her self-belief and her awareness of the new\u000aresponsibilities that go with the title. The honour has come when she is at the\u000apeak of her powers, which means that she still has the years ahead of her to\u000aripen into a musician of greater depth and poise. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Speaking\u000aof Sangita Kalanidhis, we have in our midst a grand old man known for his\u000amastery of an instrument he has made known across the world. It will be a\u000amomentous day for the ghatam when TH Vinayakram receives the ultimate accolade\u000ain Carnatic music. No upa-pakkavadya artiste has so far received the title of\u000aSangita Kalanidhi in the eight decades of the Academy. That will change when\u000athe little master is duly honoured\u2014in the near future, we hope.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">To\u000amost of us following Indian classical music, 2013 has been an unhappy year. In\u000athe South, we have lost two of our greatest violinists and the life-partner of\u000aone of them, an iconic musician-musicologist, and a devout disciple of Semmangudi\u000aSrinivasier in recent months. Such a succession of losses is perhaps inevitable\u000aat this time in history as many of our titans began their careers in the first\u000ahalf of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Over the years, Sruti has made strenuous efforts to\u000arecord the lives and reflections of many of these stalwarts during their\u000alifetimes, as well as those of past masters, but the task is substantial, and\u000awe need volunteers to come forward with material in their possession to\u000afacilitate such documentation, or to point out omissions on our part in this\u000aregard. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ashish\u000aMohan Khokar\u2019s <i>AttenDance, The Dance Annual of India </i>celebrates its 15<sup>th</sup>\u000aanniversary this month. This one-man mission is a commendable initiative that\u000acentrestages the varied perspectives of the different genres of Indian dance,\u000aoften presented by the leading lights of natya today. Guest-edited by SD Desai,\u000athe 15<sup>th</sup> anniversary issue focuses on the topic <i>Classical Dance\u000aand Modern Times. </i>Much of it seems to address the classic modern conundrum\u000aof tradition versus the compulsions of an increasingly homogeneous, globalised\u000aenvironment. Appropriately, <i>Have Faith in Tradition, Be Open to New Ideas</i>\u000ais the title of a chapter by Arushi Mudgal. What a delicate balancing act that\u000ais, in life as in the arts, is a message that confronts us everyday. Khokar has\u000ain his own way been attempting it for 15 years. We congratulate him and\u000acompliment him for his perseverance.<o:p></o:p></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">A<b> </b>variety\u000aof aspects of dance and choreography will be taken up for discussion by expert\u000apanels in a lec-dem series on Bharatanatyam to be co-presented by Sruti and\u000aApsaras Arts Academy of Singapore from 9.30 am to 12.30 pm during 16-18\u000aDecember 2013 at Tattvaloka, Eldams Road, Teynampet, Chennai.
