Frozen in time, cast in glossy paper, they were twenty-two years fresher than her own. Sharada\u2019s face, wrought with wrinkles caused both by age and worry, was a sorry shadow of her cousin\u2019s. Saraswathi would never look as careworn as her, Sharada thought. Even in those photographs in the last year of her life, she did not look like a person battling a terminal illness, two broken families and a vicious, gossipy society.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sharada gazed dreamily at the photograph with the tambura. She remembered her cousin\u2019s exact expression when she heard an apasruti string. That very expression of slight disgust and amusement had been caught perfectly in the picture. She tamed those off-key tamburas as she tamed off-key people around her\u2014calmly, ruthlessly. Yet, the person at the receiving end came off feeling that he had been done a favour.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sharada smiled.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The image of Saraswathi sleeping reminded Sharada of the way her nostrils flared and relaxed with each breath, her lips curled into a contented smile, her closed palms tucked beneath her chin. It reminded Sharada of the time when, as a teenager, Saraswathi fell asleep on her lap in the afternoons while Sharada read a book.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The photograph that affected her most was the one Ajith skipped over\u2014one of Mani performing to a sparse audience. Ajith found the inscription at the back interesting, but didn\u2019t investigate. If he had looked at the photo closely, he would have seen two women in the front row facing away from the camera: his grandmother and her cousin. The black-and-white photo didn\u2019t show it, but they were in matching blue sarees, the shade made popular by <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_18.html" target="_blank">MS.</a> It was a concert at a noisy wedding at a noisier wedding hall on Boag Road in T. Nagar. Sharada remembered the entire evening vividly, as if she had been living it each evening.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mani sang that day, accompanied by a young, spirited Veeraraghavan on the violin. An ageing <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_23.html" target="_blank">Palani Subramania Pillai</a> sat at the mridangam in his characteristically emotionless fashion. Sharada never found out the name of the ghatam vidwaan. She remembered the exact phrase with which Mani began his Todi alapana. It was a lengthy, labyrinthine briga that traversed two and a half octaves at unreal speed\u2014starting with the mandra sthayi panchamam, snaking towards the atitara shadjam, before settling down on the dhaivatam. Saraswathi, who was milling about, talking, socialising, paused mid-sentence and turned to the stage.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cLet\u2019s listen for a while?\u201d she asked Sharada.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">They settled down in the front row. Mani looked at her and stopped singing almost immediately. At twenty-eight, she was that beautiful. Mani collected himself and continued his alapana, although he seemed distracted by Saraswathi\u2019s presence in the first row.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">As if to collect himself, he rested on the panchamam for unnaturally long, closing his eyes and knotting his eyebrows in concentration. <i>Dha pa,</i> he hummed. <i>Dha pa ma pa dha pa,</i> the violin repeated. \u201cHmmm,\u201d he said, in appreciative contemplation. He repeated after the violin, and fed off that sangati, revolving around the madhya sthayi to come back, each time, to the same phrase. <i>Dha pa ma pa dha pa.</i> And every time he came back to that phrase, he opened his eyes and looked at Saraswathi, as if he expected the phrase to trigger some memory.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Saraswathi began losing herself in the Todi. Languorous, formless, floating, yet precise, imaginative, structured, it disarmed her. She was listening to a Todi that was fresh and new, yet traditional and classical. It was a Todi of paradoxes. It was a Todi you could touch and feel, but never hold. It was a Todi that softened Saraswathi\u2019s heart.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">With each passing song, Mani began ignoring more of the audience and concentrating only on Saraswathi, and she, for her part, forgot that she was at a noisy wedding.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When the concert ended, the bride, a movie actress, came to the stage to honour the artistes. When they were descending, the bride spotted Saraswathi in the front row and called out, \u201cSarasi!\u201d Saraswathi came out of her trance and noticed the bride standing with Mani. She walked up to her.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cThis is Mani. I\u2019m sure you know him,\u201d the actress said, \u201cAnd this is Saraswathi - I know her because she sang at my first wedding,\u201d she giggled.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Saraswathi had heard of Mani, but had never heard him until that day. She had seen him at social gatherings. She had vague memories of listening to him when she was around ten years old, but she couldn\u2019t confirm whether they were true.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cYou sing?\u201d Mani asked.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cNot much anymore, I teach more than I sing now.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cThis is Saras\u2019s cousin, Sharada,\u201d the actress said.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mani smiled, briefly glancing at Sharada before turning to Saraswathi. Sharada smiled back. The actress then whisked the cousins away to introduce them to other people.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">They ate in the dining hall, Mani and Saraswathi safely away from each other\u2019s eyes. After dinner, the cousins stayed back to talk to the bride her and siblings, and Mani and the groom\u2019s uncle were sitting in the portico of the mantapam, arguing out some musical disagreements.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Saraswathi whispered in her cousin\u2019s ears, \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d and headed towards the restroom. On her way back, from a shadowy corridor, she heard a voice, \u201cJanani!\u201d it said, in a stage-whisper. Saraswathi ignored the voice. \u201cJanani!\u201d it came, again. The same urgent hiss. Saraswathi turned to the corridor to see Mani silhouetted against a dim room behind him. He beckoned her again, \u201cJanani!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">She asked, suspiciously, \u201cYou\u2019re calling me?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cYes.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">She walked to him, and said, \u201cJanani?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mani\u2019s face fell. He looked at her closely and asked again, \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cAren\u2019t I what?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cJanani?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Saraswathi frowned, \u201cNo.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cJanani, the old man with the veena, that town on the hill, the railway station?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cNo.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mani looked as if someone hit him with a club. He muttered, \u201cSorry,\u201d and walked through the door that led to the side exit. He walked briskly, opened the side door and found himself in a narrow back alley.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cSir!\u201d a voice called behind him. It was Saraswathi.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">He stopped.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cI just wanted to tell you - I have never heard anyone sing like you.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cThanks,\u201d Mani muttered, slightly flushed. They were walking towards each other now, involuntarily.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cSir, can I learn from you?\u201d she asked, almost floating towards him. They were only a couple of metres apart.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cCome home tomorrow, I\u2019ll listen to you sing, and we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said, standing two paces away from her.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cThanks!\u201d she said, taking one step towards him. They were close enough to touch now.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cSaras?\u201d came Sharada\u2019s voice from behind her. Both of them took a step back.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow, then,\u201d Mani said, putting on a formal voice.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Saraswathi replied, sounding even more formal.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sharada realised that she had walked into a moment where even though there wasn\u2019t any physical closeness, there was intimacy. She wondered for years if it had been her entry that day delayed Saraswathi\u2019s crime by a few days. She also wondered if she could have averted the whole thing if she had walked in moments earlier, if she had just stopped Saraswathi from running after him into the gully.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sharada couldn\u2019t sift through those photographs anymore. She felt the kozhukattai in her throat growing, butterflies in her stomach flying more intensely, and drops of saltwater on her cheeks with each passing photo.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sharada wasn\u2019t too fond of nostalgia. She found it awkward, even slightly disturbing, to look at old photographs, remember the \u2018good\u2019 times. Somehow, the good memories tended to throw up bad ones. The two were always intertwined, as in those photographs. For every photo of Saraswathi looking ravishing, there was Mani on the other side of the camera, prowling around her to capture her charm. For every carefree smile, every happy phone call from Saraswathi in Kodaikanal, there were phone calls from Mani\u2019s wife, and the questions that the world asked Sharada about her cousin. Nostalgia tickled her, and pricked her at the same time. Sharada couldn\u2019t take it.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Just then Ajith knocked on the door and cried, \u201cPaati!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sharada didn\u2019t say a word. Ajith called again, and again. The knock grew louder, and more worried. \u201cPaati? Are you there? You don\u2019t have to come outside. I just want to know if you\u2019re okay.\u201d Sharada didn\u2019t say anything. She picked up her TV remote and turned it on. The Kerala TV channel had started its early morning Guruvayoorappan bhajans. She increased the volume until it drowned out Ajith\u2019s remonstrations.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The phone in her room rang. She turned down the volume and picked it up. It was Ajith, \u201cPaati. I\u2019m going to Kodaikanal. I\u2019ll be back in a couple of days.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sharada did not react, just put the phone down and sat on her bed.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ajith didn\u2019t go to Kodaikanal. He called Shankar instead and asked if he could meet Mani for another interview. At eleven o clock, after a lengthy breakfast at her house, Ajith and Nethra found themselves at Mani\u2019s gate. The house, as always, looked disused. But, the gate was locked from the outside. Ajith called Shankar\u2019s phone and found out that Mani had been rushed to hospital - he had lost consciousness that morning. Shankar could barely speak on the phone; fear made his voice tremble.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When they reached the hospital, they found Shankar and Mani\u2019s brother, Sadasivam running around, completing all the formalities. Amidst filling out forms and making payments, Sadasivam told Ajith, \u201cIf Anna becomes conscious again, the first thing he\u2019ll want to do is get back home. He hates this hospital business!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sure enough, the next morning, a conscious Mani kicked up a fuss and shifted back home. First, he complained that the ambulance that brought him was dirty and bad, and demanded that the ambulance that took him back should be the posh, new one. Then, he pointed out that the bed they gave him was uncomfortable, \u201cThis is the one you give to dying people, no?\u201d He told off the doctor for missing his rounds and delaying Mani\u2019s discharge.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When he reached home, the first thing he did was order Ajith to come and finish the interview that afternoon, \u201cI have only three days left to live,\u201d he said on the phone, his voice, once an arresting baritone, was now too feeble and unclear to even convey this message intelligibly. Shankar translated it for Ajith.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ajith sat by Mani\u2019s bed, now housed in the same dingy room upstairs where Ajith met him the first time. The curtains were drawn and there was little light in the room. Ajith sat on a chair and Mani, leaning towards him on one side, was almost on his lap. Ajith held his dictaphone right next to Mani\u2019s mouth as he asked him the questions.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cSir, your second disappearance, in 1987-88, what caused it?\u201d When he asked him this question, a piece of a jigsaw suddenly fell in place\u2014the dates in Taapi\u2019s photographs were all late 1987 or early 1988.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mani took some time answering the question.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cUnrest,\u201d Mani said, finally.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cCan you elaborate?\u201d Ajith asked.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mani didn\u2019t say a word, but turned his head and faced the ceiling in silence. Ajith was supposed to infer that Mani wanted to say nothing more.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cSir,\u201d Ajith tried again, \u201cdo you have any interest in other arts? Say, photography?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ajith realised, as soon as he asked it, that the question was too direct. Mani\u2019s eyes turned almost instantly from the ceiling to Ajith and glared at him. There was no response to this question either. Ajith had hit a dead-end. He had to pursue his story elsewhere.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Resignedly, he asked, \u201cSir, do you have any regrets about your musical career?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cNo,\u201d Mani said, clearly having lost the inclination to talk anymore.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ajith asked, \u201cFor instance, you haven\u2019t been awarded the Sangita Kalanidhi...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cNo regret about that, definitely,\u201d he said with a start, \u201c<a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MD Ramanathan</a> never got it.

I almost died in 1988; she saved me. The only thing I could give her in return was my music. Once she died, I had no reason to perform, no one to perform for.

Mani was startled. Ajith said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t love your wife all that much. Both of us know enough to know that. That can\u2019t have been the reason.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cI\u2019m too weak to smile. I would have smiled otherwise,\u201d Mani said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the reason.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">He paused, collected his breath, and continued, \u201cI had been a bad family man - ignored my wife, my children, immersed in my musical world.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ajith still didn\u2019t understand why Mani held up this facade. Both of them knew it wasn\u2019t always Mani\u2019s music that separated him and his family.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cWhen I lost my mind and nearly died, my wife came looking for me. She nursed me back to health. I realised that she had no source of income apart from me. She did some tailoring, but that wasn\u2019t enough. I had to keep performing and teaching to keep her alive. So, I performed to keep her going. When she died, I saw no reason to continue performing. I had lost interest in the process for fifteen years anyway.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">It was an unconvincing story, but it seemed closer to the truth than what Mani had been telling people all along.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cYour wife came looking for you. Where were you at that time?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cYou don\u2019t know? I thought you knew more.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ajith didn\u2019t know what to make of that.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mani carried on, \u201cI had a house near Kodaikanal then. I was staying there, alone. The weather didn\u2019t agree with me, I almost always had a cold and severe breathing problems. One evening, I went for a long walk, and I became breathless in a fairly secluded place. I fell down that day, and I woke up a few days later at home, with my wife. We stayed there until I was strong enough to travel again. We sold that house, and came back to Madras to start over again.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mani began coughing uncontrollably, and Shankar, who was under strict instructions not to enter the room, rushed in. Mani motioned to Ajith to leave, as he still coughed. Shankar, peering through his thick glasses, told Ajith, \u201cHe\u2019ll call you when he\u2019s better. See you then.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mani wasn\u2019t going to tell him the truth, Ajith had to ask his Paati.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: right;"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(<a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/08/sruti-fiction_7.html" target="_blank">To be continued</a>)</span></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Disclaimer: This is a work of fiction, with fictional characters.
