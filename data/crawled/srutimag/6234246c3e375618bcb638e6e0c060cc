I had to get up at 5 am last Sunday to do that. I had heard young Hindustani vocalist Nishad Matange a couple of years ago at friend Navaneet Venkatesan\u2019s residence and been impressed and so agreed to forego some of my well-deserved weekend beauty sleep, to go to IIT Madras, where Navaneet had arranged a private concert of Nishad\u2019s. Nishad has a lovely voice and a strong technical accomplishment that he owes his guru Manik Bhide of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana, not to mention the foundation laid by his mother Jyoti Matange. His focused performance, with excellent control over sruti alignment and rhythm, indicated that solid effort had gone into his riyaz since I had heard him last. His vocalization in the lower register was particularly impressive. Nishad certainly did not disappoint the small audience that had gathered that morning. To my delight, he cheerfully agreed to continue singing at my residence after the concert. He also turned out to be a thoughtful and articulate conversationalist.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aUnfortunately, we do not know for sure that Nishad, who has also trained with Rajshekhar Mansur and Ashwini Bhide Deshpande, whom he has accompanied vocally on stage, will pursue music as a career. He is just as passionate about science\u2014he is in the final leg of his PhD in biochemistry at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru\u2014as he is about music, and he will have to make a tough choice once he completes his studies. We can only hope that he will somehow combine both art and science in his career, for he is quite an outstanding talent.</div></div>
