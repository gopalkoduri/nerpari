Her voice embodies bhava and melody. Vani spoke to Sruti about her musical journey.&nbsp;</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>How did it all start?</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I started learning Carnatic vocal at the age of five in Irvine, California, from Smt. Padma Kutty. A dedicated teacher, she literally breathes music and offers her soul to each and every student. From the start, she placed utmost importance on the fundamentals of music such as sruti and layam.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />My parents created such an environment for me and my brothers that music was a natural and constant part of life, not merely an extracurricular activity. It was a family affair. We woke up in the morning to an alarm clock set to Sri KVN\u2019s music; the snooze button was never needed. At almost any given time, at least one of the three of us (me and my 2 brothers) would be in some room in the house practising, either vocal/violin, solo/together. Music was played in the car; we attended concerts regularly as a family. It was omnipresent and our lifestyle wrapped itself around it!</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>How did you come under the tutelage of Ranjani-Gayatri?&nbsp;</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I started learning from them in the summer of 2002. After a brief meeting in the US a few months earlier, my family and I met them personally when we came to Chennai. My brothers and I sang a couple of songs and before I could realize what was happening, we were taken to the next room and Gayatri aunty taught us <i>\u2018Marakata lingam,\u2019</i> in Vasantha. That day, I embarked on the most significant and meaningful journey of my life!</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />My perception of music changed drastically after my first summer with them. I began to appreciate music on a whole new level: the beauty behind each swaram, the importance of each and every nuance, the purity and richness of sound that stems from open akaram.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I spent every subsequent summer vacation (for eight years until I finally moved here) in Chennai to continue learning from Ranjani aunty and Gayatri aunty. Many years I would travel alone, but missing friends and home wasn\u2019t enough of a reason to stop me from coming! To this day, I thank my lucky stars every day that I get to know them on such a personal level and learn from them. Their inspirational music and personalities spark my unyielding desire to learn more and more!</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Also, I\u2019m immensely grateful to my grandmother for so graciously providing me with the most comfortable home in Chennai.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>You grew up in a household with brothers who are also musically inclined. Surely there were squabbles about music?</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />We hardly fought about music, to be honest. My brothers, Arun and Shiva (disciples of Sri Delhi P. Sunder Rajan), and I started learning vocal music together. They concurrently started playing the violin. Somewhere down the line, my brothers\u2019 passion directed them towards the violin; they perform both as duet artists and as accompanists.&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />They are like my 24 hour hotline; I can clarify any musical doubts with them at any given time. Practising with them is extremely beneficial for me. Apart from having a great time and creating invaluable memories, I learn so much from them. As our music training has diverged over the years, it adds more interesting facets and dynamics to our musical interactions. Today, it wouldn\u2019t be strange at all to see me online on Skype at 3am, practising with my younger brother Shiva, back home in LA. As kids, all three bof us have performed together! These days, it\u2019s either a duet concert by them, or one of them accompanying me. It\u2019s always a huge comfort when they are on stage with me!</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Being able to share this wondrous art form with my brothers is a blessing and it creates a truly special sibling bond amongst us.&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>How has living in Chennai changed your perception of music and your approach towards it?</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />While living in Chennai, I find that music becomes truly immersive. Here, it\u2019s more than a livelihood, it is life itself. Though music can be cultivated and developed anywhere in the world, I feel that Chennai is the place I should be.&nbsp; There are ample opportunities available to gain experience both in performance and listening, enabling me to grow at a substantial rate.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The best thing about living here is the constant interaction I have with my gurus. I treasure each moment with them whether in class, playing the tambura at their concerts, or even a phone call.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>What\u2019s your favourite venue in Chennai?</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Whether you\u2019re treading the majestic grounds of the Music Academy where the rich legacy and tradition lingers in the air, or at the more contemporary Arkay Convention Center, you\u2019ll find yourself a refreshingly unique experience.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I have an affinity towards Sivagami Pethachi Auditorium in Mylapore, where Brahma Gana Sabha customarily holds concerts. I\u2019ve had some glorious experiences there as both a performer and a rasika. My first ever December Season concert was held there in 2011. A combination of flawless acoustics and palpable vibes of encouragement from the audience created a beautiful ambience that allowed me to sing with a sense of joy.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The following season (2012), I experienced one of the most mesmerizing concerts by my gurus at that venue. I could feel the energy ricocheting off the walls during the Kantamani ragam-tanam-pallavi. The venue has a certain intimacy between the artist and audience.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>Have you found it difficult to be accepted because you are an NRI artist?</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I have never really thought of it as even the tiniest of hurdles. My place of origin has not had any effect on my efforts here. Though the \u2018woes of an NRI\u2019 is a recurring tea-time topic, I try to not dwell on the matter. After all, music is a meritocracy. Able and talented individuals will be suitably rewarded in the long run.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
