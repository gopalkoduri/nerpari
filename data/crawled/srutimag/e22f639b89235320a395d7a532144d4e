This year there was an unprecedented crowd at Tatvaloka Hall, when Sikkil Gurucharan, Shashank, K. Gayatri, violin duo Mysore Manjunath and Nagaraj and Malladi Brothers performed at the venue.&nbsp; <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Another notable event was the veena recital by Thayapari Niranjan. The quality of the recital was comparable to that of any of our own vainikas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">The organizers reserved one slot exclusively for thevaram hymns performed by young Maiyilai Sargurunatha Odhuvar, an admirable inclusion. Set to music in Tamil isai pans, the hymns moved the listeners. In praise of Siva, they were by saints Appar, Tirugnanasambandar and Sundaramurti Nayanar.&nbsp; <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">The Odhuvar was accompanied on the violin by Kallidaikurichi Balakrishnan, S. Yugarajan on the mridangam and S. Krishnan on the morsing. \u201cI am planning a few concerts for these talented Odhuvars in big temples in countries like England and Canada, so that they will have no financial worries when they return here. They can concentrate on their profession in the temples here, with the remuneration they get,\u201d said Niranjan of SIFAS and <a href="http://carnaticradio.com/">CarnaticRadio.com</a>.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">According to Niranjan Nandhagopan, SIFAS audiences at such Tamil Isai concerts number between 500 and 1000. \u201cIn Sri Lanka too, rasika-s welcome pure Tamil isai. In England, Australia or Canada, it is the Sri Lankan Tamils who support such cultural events and attend in large numbers, both at temples and other venues.\u201d <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">The music school run by SIFAS has more than 1200 students, who are enthusiastic about learning Carnatic music. On 15 December 2011, an agreement was signed between the Madras Music Academy and SIFAS to conduct workshops once in a quarter in Singapore and an MoU exchanged between N Murali, President, Music Academy and SIFAS official Chelladurai.</div></div>
