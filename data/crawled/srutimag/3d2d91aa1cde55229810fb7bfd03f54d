The First Vice-President of the National Assembly and Member for La Pinière, Fatima Houda-Pepin, praised the work of representatives of institutional and community organisations dedicated to community service and paid tribute in a special way to Priyamvada Sankar, to whom she presented the medal. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Excerpts from the citation:<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">\u201cIt is a privilege for me to present the Medal of the National Assembly to Mrs. Priyamvada Sankar, for her commitment to the arts and for her significant contribution to the advancement of Quebec and the influence of Indo-Canadian culture in our society. I have great admiration for this woman of great elegance that gives each of her Indian classical dance performances a touch of purity and authenticity that reminds us of the richness of this magnificent ancient culture. Mrs. Sankar has charmed audiences representing the most diverse in the arts and in many cultural centers in Quebec, rest of Canada, the United States and India. She also has helped establish the Interfaith Council of Montreal where she has worked for the reconciliation and harmonious relations between different cultural communities. Humanistic in her commitment, she makes every effort to provide young people the desire to excel and in aesthetics. Congratulations to Mrs. Sankar for what you are and for the love of the art that you share so generously with us all.\u201d </div></div>
