Vasanthakumari?</a> She electrified rasika-s with the exciting trills and briga-s of her voice, and her daring adventures in the upper reaches, more than anything else in her early concerts. The story of how <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB</a> took her under his wing when <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_06.html" target="_blank">MLV\u2019s</a> parents were still hesitant about the way forward for their talented daughter has been recorded in <i>Sruti</i> as elsewhere. According to <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB</a> himself as quoted in <i>Sruti,</i> \u201cVasanthi typifies real discipleship. She applies her mind to all she absorbs and presents a glorious edifice of her own creation.\u201d <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_06.html" target="_blank">MLV</a> once told <i>Sruti</i> that <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB</a> said to her: \u201cTake only the good aspects of my music. Don\u2019t copy me in every respect, because that would amount to mimicry. Cultivate your manodharma, your own sense of imagination.\u201d He exhorted her to listen to the concerts of musicians like <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music.html" target="_blank">Ariyakudi,</a> <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-of-indian-classical-music.html" target="_blank">Semmangudi,</a> <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_02.html" target="_blank">Madurai Mani,</a> <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_11.html" target="_blank">D.K. Pattammal</a> and M.S. Subbulakshmi.</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">To describe <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_06.html" target="_blank">MLV\u2019s</a> music, we can do no better than quote Aeolus (S.V. Seshadri) whose 1963 article in <i>Shankar\u2019s Weekly</i> was reproduced in <i>Sruti</i> 75-76. \u201cHer knowledge of the intricacies of raga, swara and tala\u201d, he said, \u201cis unassailably sound, but she wears her learning with an easy grace.\u201d Later in the same article, Aeolus said, \u201cVasanthakumari\u2019s voice is remarkable for its briga-s or those figures in which the notes are organized into roulades or turns or mordents. She exploits this quality to its utmost, but rarely, one should say, at the expense of the mood of a raga.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cIf the raga-singing of Vasanthakumari is characterized by the exuberance of briga-s, her swaraprastara reveals an enviable command of both raga and tala. Swaraprastara, one might say, is <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_06.html" target="_blank">MLV\u2019s</a> forte. Listening to her elaborating a pallavi in four-beat tempo, one cannot but marvel at the incredible mastery she displays in all aspects of pallavi singing.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cVasanthakumari\u2019s public concerts have a uniform standard of success. She has learnt from <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB,</a> whose disciple she was for some time, the art of varying the tempo of the musical pieces without allowing the listener\u2019s interest to flag. From him, too, she has learnt the salutary principle of avoiding pedantry and egoistic preciosity.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">A 1984 <i>Sruti</i> critique noted another important similarity in her music to <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB\u2019s:</a> \u201cAgain, as in raga alapana, so in swaraprastara too Vasanthakumari shows a penchant for sruti bhedam, or graha bhedam\u2026. Here she adds a twist, by revealing the outline of a different raga while executing the graha bhedam in one.\u201d </span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Other <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB</a> disciples</span></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">T.R. Balasubramaniam was the one <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB</a> sishya who could have reached a position of eminence in Carnatic music such as attained by <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_06.html" target="_blank">MLV,</a> had he not died prematurely young. He was a rising star in the 1950s, with his strong voice and pleasing style, reminiscent of his guru\u2019s. He was one of the last of the old guard of disciples to experience gurukulavasa. He very efficiently managed <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB\u2019s</a> affairs including his family budget. Largely responsible for the publication of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB\u2019s</a> <i>Gana Bhaskara Manimalai,</i> T.R. Balu died on the concert stage. He made a lasting contribution to Carnatic music in the form of his disciples Radha-Jayalakshmi. He was the first of a number of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB</a> sishya-s who bore his name \u2014 S. Balasubramaniam and T.S. Balasubramaniam (who has contributed to this commemorative volume) were among them. It was even jokingly rumoured that you had to be a Balasubramaniam to be accepted as <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB\u2019s</a> pupil!</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">An outstanding talent honed by GNB was Tanjavur S. Kalyanaraman, yet another sishya who died while in the prime of his career. <i>Sruti\u2019s</i> pitamaha S. Rajam has rated him as the most intelligent of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB\u2019s</a> students. He was known to enter into musical discourse with <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB</a> even as a disciple. He once recalled this piece of advice from his guru: \u201cIn my career, I have sung many raga-s \u2014 small, large and rare. Still, no raga gives you fulfillment as do tried and tested raga-s like Todi, Kalyani, Kambhoji, Bhairavi or Sankarabharanam. Rare raga-s are like badam halva, good only when rarely sung.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">L. Krishnan, Someswara Babu, Madurai Ganesan, Rangadurai, P.S. Tyagarajan and T.V. Viswanathan, and Ragini were among the lucky direct disciples, while some of his sishya-s\u2019 sishya-s have gone on to achieve eminence, with perhaps Sudha Ragunathan the most famous of them, while Charumathi Ramachandran is another senior <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_06.html" target="_blank">MLV</a> disciple. Raji Gopalakrishnan\u2019s music is known for its <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_06.html" target="_blank">MLV</a> touches, and&nbsp; Bhushani Kalyanaraman is another belonging to the <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB</a> lineage through her late husband\u2019s tutelage.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The likes of Ramnad Krishnan and S. Rajam were influenced heavily by <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB\u2019s</a> music. After attending a <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB</a> concert, Rajam often went home and practised all night, trying to emulate the maestro.</span></div></div>
