The guru wouldn\u2019t have been a guru if he didn\u2019t get a first student to teach. With Radha and Anandhi, he was able to prove his prowess as a guru. By the time Baby Kamala and others followed, Ramiah Pillai had his technique strongly established, thanks to the many untiring hours he spent grooming his first students.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">During the last December season, the Natya Kala Conference held at Krishna Gana Sabha celebrated the bicentenary of Tanjavur Vadivelu without displaying his portrait on the stage. Musicologist B.M. Sundaram pointed that out at the opening of his speech. The other event the conference celebrated was the centenary of natyacharya Vazhuvoor Ramiah Pillai. A whole host of Vazhuvoor school alumni gathered for the event. But once again the Natyacharya\u2019s first and foremost students, Radha Viswanathan and Anandhi\u2019s names were left unmentioned and almost overlooked in the proceedings.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Radha lives a peaceful retired life with her younger son Shrinivasan at Bangalore. For her, the memory of her guru lives on. Her right hand that kept the <i>talam</i> in countless MS concerts is now struck by paralysis, but a couple of years ago, she did abhinaya for Kalki\u2019s <i>\u2018Malai pozhudhinile\u2019</i> sitting in a wheelchair, at the Cleveland Tyagaraja Aradhana. Tears are unavoidable as you watch her performance on a Youtube video posted by her son. Every time she hears an old tune, her face glows with a smile.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /><i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">In an interview with Veejay Sai, Radha Viswanathan fondly remembers her guru during his centenary.</span></i></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The first contact with the guru</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I was six years old when Appa (T Sadasivam) came to me and said I must learn dance. He said I must start learning from guru Ramiah Pillai of Mayavaram. My guru came home and fixed a date and time from when he would come and teach me bharatanatyam.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Early lessons</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">First he started with footwork. This went on for many days, almost a month. He insisted on perfect footwork and we came to hand gesturing much later. After three to four years, my cousin Anandhi joined as his second student and our classes became more regular. After almost six months of basic footwork he began working with us on an <i>alarippu,</i> just as in music, the first six to eight months we learnt was the <i>sarali</i> and <i>janta varisais.</i> The next lessons in dance were <i>sabdams.</i> It wasn\u2019t before a whole year that we reached the stage of a <i>varnam.</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">We had classes on alternate days and this went on for many years. Amma (MS) came and observed. She never taught dance but asked us to follow whatever <i>Vazhuvooraar</i> taught us in our lessons. After he left I would continue my practice for a long time. If you don\u2019t practise music for a day or two you can manage, but with dance, you have to practise everyday. That is what we did.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Debut</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Our <i>arangetram</i> was organized by Appa at Mylapore on 13 April, the Tamil new year\u2019s day.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I was 13. Anandhi and I alternated in the evening. One of us opened with alarippu and the other did jatiswaram. We performed sabdam and varnam the same way. For abhinaya, I did a line and she did another and in the tillana we did that once again. Together we performed <i>\u2018Natanam aadinar\u2019,</i> <i>\u2018Aduvome pallu paduvome\u2019, \u2018Malaipozhudinile\u2019</i> and other pieces. For \u2018Taye Yasoda\u2019 we received two rounds of applause.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The Vazhuvoor teaching bani</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Basically he was a very nice person. He wasn\u2019t one of those gurus who would scold or beat. He was always very encouraging. Also he didn\u2019t dance himself so he was a real guru in the original sense. The student didn\u2019t have to compete with him, unlike these days!</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Retirement</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">At the age of twenty two, I decided to give up dance. From the time I was four, I had been singing with my mother. I was singing, dancing, acting in films and attending school as well. This got very hectic and I took a strong decision to stick to my singing. I told <i>Vazhuvooraar</i> and he gracefully accepted my decision. By then he also became busy as a teacher of several other students.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Bala</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Balasaraswati was staying four houses away from ours. She was great friends with my mother and others in the family. Once I requested her to teach me and she took time out from her already busy schedule and taught me a Surdas bhajan <i>\u2018Poochat Shyam kaun tum gori\u2019,</i> which I danced later in Calcutta. It was a new experience for me to do bharatanatyam to a Surdas bhajan. Bala was a tough taskmaster and her style was not just different but also very difficult for me. But in the end she was very happy with the outcome.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">MS and her role</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Amma used to dance for \u2018Taye Yasoda\u2019. Those photos of her dancing appeared in Kalki magazine\u2019s Deepavali issue. I think she learnt it from my guru. She also learnt songs from him which she popularized. For all <i>abhinaya</i> pieces Amma sang.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Moral support from the guru</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">We made arrangements for him and he came to Delhi when I danced before Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. Later he also attended when I performed at the Bangalore town hall, Bombay and several other places. We performed in places in Tamil Nadu like Mayavaram and Coimbatore and at some weddings. Even when we were shooting in films, he made sure he was present in the shooting. He personally corrected hand positions and gestures and sometimes even walked into the set.</span></div>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
