V<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">More on Oli Chamber Concert 7</span></b><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">By Vivadi</span></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">A Sangeetha Sivakumar concert is always something to look forward to, for she never holds herself back on the stage. In finding new nooks and corners to explore, she is unafraid to push herself one step further, even while performing. The opening sketch of Mayamalavgaula (succeeded by <i>Vidulaku mrokkeda</i>) was to serve as a primer to mood of the concert that was to follow; meditative yet lively.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sometimes she slips, yes, but when she pulls it off, the effect is dazzling. The Reetigaula <i>alapana</i> that preceded <i>Paripaalaya</i> and niraval at <i>tamarasayata lochana</i> were perfect examples of this no-holds-barred effort. In trying to reach the tara sthayi shadjam in a lightning flash, she mis-stepped, stopped, and admonished herself with a \u201cHmmm\u201d. Then, she picked up where she had left off and unfurled a swirl of breathtaking briga-s around the shadjam. Musicians of three preceding generations of her bani - Charumathi Ramachandran, M.L. Vasanthakumari and G.N.B. himself - would have been proud of that passage of music.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">While a strong influence of that lineage is but naturally evident in her singing, Sangeetha\u2019s music is her own. After the concert, in a brief interview for <b><i>Oli,</i></b> she acknowledged the advantages of having a defined musical ancestry, but stressed, more than once, that a musician must find her own style. \u201cWho you are must come out in your music,\u201d she said. The concert was a <i>rakti</i> raga treat as Reetigaula paved way for Dhanyasi and Begada was soon on its way. Subbaraya Sastri\u2019s Dhanyasi gem <i>Dalachinavaru,</i> was sung with chaste simplicity which made it all the more profound. Melakaveri Balaji initially suffered at the hands of the in-house air-conditioning but soon emerged triumphant to provide great support.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sangeetha\u2019s music is decidedly less manic as compared to her predecessors, and the best example of that came in the swaraprastaram in <i>Nadopasana</i> in Begada. Eschewing the madhyamakala completely, Sangeetha focussed on the majesty of the chaukakala, taking us on what seemed like a leisurely, yet comprehensive guided walk through Begada\u2019s idiosyncrasies - its hard-to-pin-down form and structure, its odd phrases, and the <i>madhyamam</i> and <i>nishadam</i> that don different clothes for different occasions. Each swara, each sangati and each pause was immersed in Begada. VVS Murari backed this up with a delightful <i>alapana,</i> just as nuanced and intricate.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">This masterful Begada was not the high point of her concert. When it ended, she sang a few phrases of Todi and launched into an exquisite rendition of Subbarama Iyer\u2019s <i>Maane mayile kuyil kanmaniye.</i> To those in the hall who had heard T. Viswanathan sing this superb padam as only he could, this unexpected revival brought a deep wistful joy.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When singing padams, it is important for the singer to be in character, the nayika, bemoaning the fact that she has not seen her <i>mannan.</i> For those eight minutes that she wept through an astonishingly beautiful Todi, Sangeetha threw herself into that role. It was a refreshing break from bhakti for Oli!</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sangeetha\u2019s choice of ragas and compositions seemed to have been planned especially for an intimate ambience such as the one at Rasvihar that day and she was ably supported by Murari and Balaji in making this a memorable concert.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The concert</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Vidulaku mrokkeda \u2013 Mayamalavagaula \u2013 Adi \u2013 Tyagaraja</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Gopanandana \u2013 Bhushavali \u2013 Adi \u2013 Swati Tirunal</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Paripalaya mam \u2013 Reetigaula \u2013 Rupakam \u2013 Swati Tirunal</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Dalachinavaru \u2013 Dhanyasi \u2013 Adi \u2013 Subbaraya Sastri</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Nadopasanache \u2013 Begada \u2013 Adi \u2013 Tyagaraja</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Maane mayile \u2013 Todi \u2013 Adi \u2013 Vaideeswaran Koil Subbarama Iyer</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Vani pondu \u2013 Kanada \u2013 Rupakam \u2013 Dharmapuri Subbarayar</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The Artistes</span></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>Sangeetha Sivakumar,</b> a disciple of Smt Charumathi Ramachandran, is a torchbearer of the GNB bani. Her trademark is a balanced approach to her craft, keeping her inimitable lightning-like singing in tandem with karvai-laden, soulful music. A musician\u2019s musician, she is known for her mastery over the technical aspects of music. She is non-compromising when it comes to classical fervour and this adds an extra-dimension to her free-flowing music.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>VVS Murari</b> comes from a great musical lineage.

Sri Murari has imbibed a fine style of accompaniment whereby he is a pillar of support to the vocalist but also shines as a complete musician on his own.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>Melakaveri Balaji</b> comes from a family of musicians. A disciple of his father Sri Krishnamurthi, Sri Balaji is known for his sprightly and sensitive accompaniment. With a career spanning over three decades, Balaji has derived great experience from accompanying several veterans and this shows clearly in his deft playing.</span></div></div>
