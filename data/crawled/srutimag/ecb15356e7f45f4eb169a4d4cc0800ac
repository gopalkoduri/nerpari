My father T.S. Ramanathan encouraged\u000ame to listen to a lot of music even as a child. We were four girls and two\u000aboys, in the family. We only listened to Carnatic music. My father was a double\u000aM.A. \u2013&nbsp; in Sanskrit and English\u000aLiterature \u2013 from Annamalai University. He was well versed in ragam singing,\u000aand could render many small kritis very beautifully. Though he had not learnt\u000athe lakshana of music, he had a strong sense of the lakshya. We absorbed a lot of\u000amusic instinctively from him, whenever he sang at home. As my father used to\u000avisit the music department at Annamalai University, giants like Sathur A.G.\u000aSubramaniam and others became his close friends, and would often visit our home\u000ain Kerala. All these associations, as well as my father\u2019s abiding interest in\u000amusic, inculcated a passion for music in me and my siblings from a very young\u000aage. I began performing at the age of&nbsp;\u000anine. Initially my father was a little reluctant to allow me to perform\u000aas society was more orthodox then, and girls who performed often were frowned\u000aupon by polite society.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">My first guru was Narayana Bhagavatar. He taught me\u000asome ashtapadis and small songs. Whenever he used to pass by our house, he\u000awould come in and ask my father, \u201cI want to hear Balamani sing. Will she sing\u000afor me now?\u201d He showered me with affection and encouraged me to sing whenever\u000athe chance came by. Soon my father began supporting the idea of me performing.\u000aI began performing with my sister, T.R. Sarasa, under the name \u201cThatthamangalam\u000aSisters\u201d. My father was a Post Master in Tripunithura, but refused a promotion\u000aas he would be transferred to different towns, and he did not want any kind of\u000abreak in my music training.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">Once we all travelled from Tripunithura to Cochin to listen\u000ato Palghat Rama Bhagavatar. All my siblings were as smitten with music as I\u000awas. We eagerly went to the concert venue, well before time. I remember Rama\u000aBhagavatar sang Kharaharapriya that day, followed by <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html">Tyagaraja\u2019s</a> <i>Rama nee\u000asamanamevaru</i>. I was awestruck with his handling of the raga and the kriti.\u000aMy father had to report early to work the next day. He looked at me at one\u000apoint during the concert and on observing that I was listening to the music\u000adumbstruck with wonder, he smiled and sat through the entire concert with us.\u000aThat was the kind of sacrifice he was ready to make for us. I&nbsp; choke with emotion when I think of those\u000adays.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">I completed my SSLC at Tripunithura and secured good marks.\u000aI had a choice of either continuing my academics, for which I would have had to\u000aenrol at the Maharaja\u2019s College, Ernakulam, or continue my musical journey. I\u000awanted to chose music. My father suggested that I join the Central College of\u000aCarnatic Music, in Madras. I readily accepted. I moved to Madras soon after and\u000astayed in a hostel, while studying at the Music College.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br />\u000aI remember when I first went for the interview, I was\u000aapprehensive about what I might be asked to sing. I was told that the standard\u000aexpected of the students was very high. But with the blessings of the Almighty,\u000athe interview went smoothly. I was directly enrolled in the 4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp; year. I passed out in 1957 with flying\u000acolours. Though the principal Musiri Subramania Iyer encouraged me to answer my\u000atheory papers in English, I was adamant about writing them in Tamil, as I\u000awanted to master the language.&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;">My mentors at the college were Musiri Subramania Iyer,\u000aTirupamburam Swaminatha Pillai and <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_26.html" target="_blank">T. Brinda.</a> Swaminatha Pillai was very\u000aaffectionate towards me and taught me many rare pallavis. I also learnt from\u000aChittoor Subramania Pillai. I had opted for the veena as my subsidiary elective\u000ain college and thus got to learn from M.A. Kalyanakrishna Bhagavatar and\u000aDevakottai Narayana Iyengar. I learnt the Kalyani Ata tala varnam <i>Vanajakshi</i>\u000aas well as many kritis like <i>Janaki ramana</i> (Suddha Seemantini) on the\u000aveena.</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">A couple of years after passing out, at the instance of\u000aMusiri Subramania Iyer, I applied for the Central Government scholarship. The\u000apanel of examiners were an intimidating lot \u2013 Musiri, Kumbakonam Rajamanickam\u000aPillai, <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_23.html">Pazhani Subramania Pillai,</a> and Parur Sundaram Iyer. After being grilled\u000aextensively for almost two hours, I was informed that I was selected. Learning\u000afrom Musiri was an experience in aesthetics. He could paint myriad nuanced hues\u000ain an apparently simple phrase, during raga alapana or niraval. He was very\u000aappreciative of my niraval singing. After class, I would serve him some tiffin\u000athat I had prepared and brought from home. He savoured my cooking. It was a\u000agreat blessing for me to serve him in whatever capacity I could. I cherish\u000athose times. In 1961 I completed my advanced training under Musiri sir. In 1962\u000aI got married, and soon after moved to Bombay.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b><br /></b></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><b>Was your husband\u000asupportive of your musical pursuits?</b></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;">Oh yes!

My husband was at the time not very enthusiastic about my leaving the\u000ahouse to go and teach music. He preferred that I teach from home. Ultimately,\u000aat the insistence of Narayana Iyengar, I began teaching at Bharatiya Fine Arts,\u000aand taught there for a few years. I never had any ambitions of becoming a\u000afamous performer myself. My heart was always in teaching and training the next\u000ageneration. I used to regularly send my students to the music competitions held\u000ain the sabhas of Bombay. They used to invariably win the tambura prize.</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">Great legends like Dr. S. Pinakapani, Voleti Venkateswarlu\u000aand Nedunuri Krishnamurthi would&nbsp; often\u000avisit us, when they came to perform in Bombay. Once K.N. Mani recorded me\u000asinging <i>Manavyalakincha</i> in Nalinakanti raga. On that occasion I had\u000aventured to sing niraval and swaras for that song. He played that recording to\u000aNedunuri sir, and the latter was impressed. He insisted on meeting me. I went\u000ato Mani\u2019s house to meet Nedunuri sir and we got about to discussing music. When\u000ahe asked me to sing, I sang the famous Sankarabharanam pallavi \u201cChakkagaani bhajana\u2019.\u000aAfter that, every time he visited Bombay, he would always stay with us in our\u000amodest little apartment in Matunga.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;">Once I was asked to perform at Bharatiya Fine\u000aArts, in memory of my guru Musiri Subramania Iyer. My husband informed the sabha\u000aorganisers that T.K. Govinda Rao was a better choice, since he represented the\u000apristine bani of Musiri. But the organisers were persistent,&nbsp; so I agreed. As luck would have it, Govinda\u000aRao was present in the audience. I went up to him before the concert and\u000aintroduced myself. I informed him that I had learnt under Musiri sir while\u000astudying at the Music College and then for a few years as a scholarship\u000astudent. He was very encouraging and told me that it would be a pleasure to\u000alisten to any musician trained by Musiri sir. I have a liking for calculations\u000ain music and that day too, I sang a pallavi in Dharmavati as the main piece,\u000areplete with many rhythmic calculations. After the concert, Govinda Rao came up\u000ato me and told me that it was my guru bhakti that had enabled me to perform\u000amusic of such high quality. After that he became a family friend. Musicians\u000alike Madurai Sreenivasan (Cheenakutty) were also very encouraging of my pallavi\u000asinging. Once I sang a concert on the radio, featuring rare ragas like Narayani,\u000aSumanesaranjani, and Rishabhapriya. Dr. S. Pinakapani, after listening to the\u000abroadcast, called up the radio station and enquired, \u201cWho is that bold woman\u000awho performed today?

They also\u000aarranged a solo concert for my daughter. I was very touched by the speeches at\u000athe felicitation function. Many famous artists like Neyveli Santhanagopalan,\u000aNagai Muralidharan, Mannargudi Easwaran, and Flute Ramani were present. They\u000aasked me to present a lecture demonstration. I told them that I was not used to\u000adoing so, and requested if I could address a question-answer session. They\u000areadily obliged. I remember Santhanagopalan asked me, \u201cWhat is the secret of\u000atraining so many great students?\u201d I replied, \u201cThere is no secret to this. It is\u000aall hard work (both mine and my students), and the blessings of my parents,\u000agurus and God.\u201d</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b><br /></b></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><b>How were you able\u000ato mould so many students to become top-class performers?</b></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;">I have always treated my students as my own children, my\u000aextended family. With God\u2019s grace I have been blessed with students who are\u000aequally affectionate towards me. I have never had a student who was a laggard,\u000aor was disinterested. They have all been so sincere. All my students are\u000aequally important to me&nbsp; \u2013 Shankar\u000aMahadevan, his brother Mani Mahadevan, Bombay Jayashri, her brother Sabesh,\u000aRaji Gopalakrishnan, Susheela Raman, Vasumathi Badrinath, Prasanna\u000aVenkataraman, my daughter Ranjani, and so many others. They worked extremely\u000ahard to master whatever I taught them. It would be unfair if I was to take full\u000acredit for their success. But I would also like to add here that my students\u000aare not only good performers, they are also good teachers. I have trained them\u000athat way. I take great pride when I see my students\u2019 students coming out today\u000aas good performers.</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b><br /></b></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><b>How important is\u000ait for a student to know&nbsp; to read and\u000awrite notation in Carnatic music?</b></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;">It is extremely important to inculcate reading and writing\u000anotation among students from the beginning. If a guru teaches the student a\u000avarnam or song, with the notation in hand, we can ensure that the student\u000arehearses the&nbsp; composition correctly,\u000aeven in the absence of the guru. This is of course subsequent to having learnt\u000athe composition from the guru in person. Notation cannot replace the guru\u2019s\u000aimportance, but it is vital in maintaining purity of pathantaram. Even years\u000aafter they have learnt a song, my students can sing it perfectly. They can also\u000ateach it correctly to their students. Also I never allow my students to record\u000aany class, since the notation, coupled with their memory, is a complete guide.</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b><br /></b></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><b>What about\u000agamakas in notation?</b></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;">This is up to the guru. The guru must first teach all the\u000anuances of the song and then introduce the notation as a guide to remembering.\u000aNotation cannot take the place of the guru. Personally I do not notate gamakas,\u000aas in my opinion it is unnecessary.</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b><br /></b></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><b>What are your\u000aspecial insights into teaching methodologies in Carnatic music?</b></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;">The onus of producing students of high calibre lies with\u000athe guru. The guru must guide and groom the students correctly right from the\u000ainception. A guru must set a strong foundation by teaching varnams in great\u000adetail. A wealth of music resides in the varnams, and learning and practicing\u000aas many varnams as one can, both in Adi tala and Ata tala, will set a strong\u000abase in order to build a&nbsp; musical\u000aedifice. Every varnam must be practiced assiduously in three speeds. Only then\u000acan you hope to master the foundation. The guru must insist on inculcating\u000avalues like sruti suddham (fidelity to pitch), azhuttham (depth) and saukhyam\u000a(ease of rendition) in students right from the beginning. Also the guru must be\u000aable to gauge each student\u2019s abilities and accordingly teach them, making\u000alearning a pleasurable experience for the student.</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">In earlier times, we were never taught how to sing raga\u000aalapana, or niraval. We were expected to grasp these things as we listened to\u000athe guru sing, either in class or in concerts.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;">We were also expected to observe\u000athis in other singers. But today things have changed. I have taken raga\u000aalapana, niraval and swara kalpana classes for my students on innumerable\u000aoccasions. I generally taught in groups, singing a phrase and then asking a\u000astudent to repeat it. I would then sing another phrase and ask the next student\u000ato repeat and so on. So by the time I finished with the last student, we would\u000ahave covered six or seven sangatis in that raga. I would develop the class like\u000athis.</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;">Also, when I take a particular raga in class, I will first\u000ateach a varnam in that raga. Then I will go on to teach three or four kritis in\u000athat raga. By the end of the fourth kriti, the student will have a clear idea\u000aof the contours of that raga and its specialities. I have always given my all\u000awhile teaching my students, no holds barred!&nbsp;</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b><br /></b></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><b>Have you taught\u000ainstrumentalists too?</b></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;">Yes, after all, I myself learnt the veena at the Music\u000aCollege.

Each one\u2019s calling in life\u000ais different and the paths they cut out for themselves are unique. Some of my\u000aown students have been successful in other genres. Bombay Jayashri has had many\u000asuccessful ventures in film music. Shankar Mahadevan, though a good Carnatic\u000avocalist, has now become internationally renowned as a Bollywood and pop\u000asinger. My grandson learns the Western keyboard and my granddaughter loves\u000aShreya Ghoshal. I never interfere with their musical choices. I even had some\u000aHindustani singers who learnt Carnatic music from me. Reewa Rathod, daughter of&nbsp; Sonali and Roop Kumar Rathod, and Sanjeev\u000aChimmalgi, disciple of C.R. Vyas, learnt from me for some time. Sriram\u000aParasuram first introduced them to me, when they evinced an interest in\u000aCarnatic music to him. I think music has no boundaries. At their core, all kinds\u000aof music speak a universal language.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b><br /></b></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><b>Today voice\u000aculture has become quite the fashion among young Carnatic vocalists. In your\u000aopinion, what do you feel is the best way to utilise the voice in Carnatic\u000amusic?</b></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;">I think the most important aspect of voice culture in our\u000amusic is <i>azhuttham</i>.&nbsp; and full\u000athroated singing. Every gamaka, every phrase must be executed with that\u000aweightiness and breadth of voice that makes our music unique. I do not support\u000aartificial singing, or singing frivolous phrases. That won\u2019t last long. While\u000ashouting is unnecessary, full-throated singing in a melodious, well-modulated\u000amanner is essential.</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b><br /></b></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><b>How would you\u000aguide a student who is weak in laya to sing pallavis?</b></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;">I would introduce singing in four speeds in the varnams\u000aitself. I would often ask my students to sing <i>Viriboni</i> in 4-kalai tala,\u000aand maintain the tala speed while steadily increasing the speed of their\u000asinging. This is the concept of anulomam used in pallavi singing. So if the\u000avarnam is taught thoroughly like this, pallavi singing becomes very easy.</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><b><br /></b></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><b>Do you have any\u000aadvice for today\u2019s Carnatic youth?</b></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; font-size: small;">\u000a\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;">I will advise them to listen to music of the highest\u000astandard, especially of the old-time stalwarts. The teachers today must\u000ainculcate that sense of discrimination among the youngsters to emulate from the\u000amusic of the titans of yore. They must eschew unnecessary antics and pursue\u000apure music. That will ensure that the best musical values are passed on to\u000afuture generations.&nbsp;</span></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
