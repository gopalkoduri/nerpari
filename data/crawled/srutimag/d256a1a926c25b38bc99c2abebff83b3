Narayanaswamy, you should be a disciple of Suguna Varadachari \u2013 so goes the saying in the Chennai music circle of talented youngsters. Brindha Manickavasakan is a disciple of the latter.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Although born in Chennai, this daughter of a technocrat specialised in extraction of oil and gas based in Dubai, had her schooling there. After she passed the tenth standard, while father Manickavasakan remained in Dubai, the rest of the family shifted to Chennai to further Brindha\u2019s training in music. Her parents were both passionately interested in the fine arts, in addition to being deeply involved in matters spiritual. They played gracious hosts to almost all visitors in these disciplines to Dubai.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Young Brindha, who received regular musical training from expatriates such as Jayasri Rao, D.J. Balakrishna and Kanakadurga Venkatesh, was also taught by many visiting musicians. Such diverse training increased her stock of not only standard classical fare but also many novel tukkada-s not heard from other musicians. Tiruppugazh songs learned from Vilasaini Karthik \u2013 a member of the \u2018Tiruppugazh Anbargal\u2019 group, also extended her repertoire.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />After shifting to Chennai in 2006, Brindha started to learn from Dr. Manjula Sriram, an accomplished teacher who also taught the versatile Vasudha Ravi. This lasted for two years and on Manjula\u2019s shifting base to Bengaluru, she came under the tutelege of Suguna Varadachari and, under her guidance, she has now turned into a fine young vocalist. Trained in the veena and Bharatanatyam too, she has, however, not found time to practise these regularly although she plays the veena occasionally at home.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />December 2010 was an exceptionally busy month for her, with around fifteen concerts, a sort of record for a 21-year-old. Reviews of her concerts have been very positive, one of them even predicting that she would join the list of front-line singers in the space of three years.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />She has released three music albums so far. She has been directly graded as \u2018B-High\u2019 by AIR, quite meritorious by itself. In last year\u2019s contest for \u2018The Carnatic Idol\u2019, an event conducted by Jaya TV, she advanced till the \u2018Super Six\u2019 in the face of stiff competition. Besides Chennai, she has sung in a few other cities in India and, of course, Dubai. She has won awards and prizes from organisations as diverse as the Music Academy, Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha, Papanasam Sivan Academy and Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavatar Trust besides various organisations in Dubai. The Parupalli Ramakrishnaiah Pantulu Award she recieved from vidwan M. Balamuralikrishna in 2009 is something very special to her.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Four years in Ramjhi\u2019s Issai Mazhalai (that is how he spells the name of his organisation!) and frequent concert opportunities as a result, are also responsible for her success. Her younger sister Arulpriya is also a member of the Issai Mazhalai troupe.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />A final year student in engineering, Brindha plans to get more involved in music after graduation.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: right;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Reproduced from <a href="http://sruti.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=4_6&amp;products_id=291&amp;zenid=7ecec7177ff99aa81fb7870b64437495" target="_blank">Sruti 318, March 2011</a>)</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
