First, when\u000aI was in south India for 18 months (September 1980 to March 1982) researching\u000aTyagaraja\u2019s life for my Harvard PhD\u2014I was fascinated by the stories\u2014the folk\u000amemories of Tyagaraja\u2019s episodes­­\u2014gathered by Prof. P. Sambamoorthy. I\u000acollected them and wrote them out in the form of a long narrative. That was the\u000afirst phase.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Then when I was a new professor at Indiana\u000aUniv.-Purdue Univ. at Indianapolis, I gathered more historical and geographical\u000abackground.&nbsp; Flora and fauna, invasions\u000aand rulers, agricultural aspects of Thanjavur, things like that. I incorporated\u000athose kinds of things I learned during that stage\u2014from 1985-90.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Then the next stage was an interest in the\u000acharacter of Jalpesa. As I learned about the archetype of the trickster, I\u000abegan to see how in the folk mind and the traditional storytellers Jalpesa\u000aserved an important purpose in the story of Tyagaraja\u2019s life.&nbsp; He harassed the saint, stole his sacred\u000aimages, divided the house, and in other ways was a contrary figure. Adding more\u000adimensions and episodes about Jalpesa gave some contrasts and further dynamics\u000ato the novel. Jalpesa could play the fool and the foil to Tyagaraja\u2019s heroism,\u000aand besides being a small time troublemaker, he could challenge Tipu Sultan,\u000aand try to fulfill his own ambitions\u2014he could have adventures in the wide world\u000awhile his brother stayed in the village and composed masterpieces. I worked on\u000athis during the last five years.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></i></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia;">What made you want to write the story anyway?<o:p></o:p></span></i></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VUihB6cXg3E/UseyNiwJedI/AAAAAAAAEHY/0bnkUX5F2ak/s1600/Ebook.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VUihB6cXg3E/UseyNiwJedI/AAAAAAAAEHY/0bnkUX5F2ak/s320/Ebook.jpg" width="207" /></a></div>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Well, in my childhood I liked to read the lives of\u000athe European saints, and the biographies of famous people like Benjamin\u000aFranklin. Later in my life, while I was studying in graduate school at Harvard,\u000amy friend Ram Ramachandran gave me the Raghavan and Ramanujachari book, <i>The Spiritual Heritage of Tyagaraja</i>, and\u000areading the pious life of Tyagaraja, it was a rediscovery of that kind of\u000aliterature about saints I\u2019d loved in my childhood.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Also, the Kaveri river played a part\u2014experiencing\u000athe way the Kaveri flows through Tiruvaiyaru was inspiring. I waded into the\u000awater when I visited the village with T. Sankaran, and the little fish nibbled\u000aat my calves, tickling me. (I grew up in Rock Island, Illinois, between the\u000aMississippi and the Rock Rivers.) The village life meant seeing how the sun\u000arose, how the temple with its incense pit attracted people, how Tyagaraja\u2019s\u000ahome looked, how the rooms were laid out\u2014a long narrow space, with some typical\u000afeatures of Tanjavur homes. I made visits to Tanjavur, Tiruvaiyaru, Sri Rangam,\u000aKanchi, Tirupati; and also to the building at Parry\u2019s Corner in Madras where\u000aTyagaraja was said to have stopped on his pilgrimage and sung some songs.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><i>South India must have made quite an impression on\u000ayou. When did you first come here?<o:p></o:p></i></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">It really did make a powerful impression. The first\u000atime was for six months in 1970-71 when I was 27 years old. Those months in\u000aAndhra Pradesh, Bangalore and Kadugodi, and in Madras\u2014that was a turning point\u000ain my life\u2014opened up new possibilities of what life could be like. The\u000atraditions were inspiring\u2014the bhajan singing, the works of art, the wisdom of\u000aIndia, and the ideals of karma yoga, besides tropical flowers and birds,\u000atemples. At the age of 27 they made deep impressions that gave me a better\u000asense of what life is all about. Then again in 1980-82 I spent eighteen months\u000ain South India, and that was a longer, deeper period of learning. I thank my\u000alucky stars I was so fortunate. For a year and a half I experienced daily life\u000ain Madras, with trips to such cities as Bangalore and Madurai. I included some\u000aof those impressions of the south in my novel <i>Gypsy Escapades,</i> published by Rupa. I kept going back to the south\u000aover the years, and have seen so many changes in recent decades. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></i></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Can you tell us what is factual and what is\u000afictional in your novel?<o:p></o:p></span></i></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">For the most factual accounts, readers can take a\u000alook at the translation I made from two of Tagaraja\u2019s disciples, Venkataramana\u000aBhagavatar and his son, Krishnaswami Bhagavatar\u2014their accounts are in my book <i>Tyagaraja - Life and Lyrics</i>, published\u000aby Oxford University Press. They give a bare bones account of what those close\u000ato him carefully wrote. I tried to use the oral traditions too\u2014the various\u000aHarikatha portrayals, the Sanskrit account, the folk memories collected by\u000aSambamoorthy. I tried to stay close to the different traditional tellings of\u000ahis life, adding the atmospheres and backgrounds of everyday life in the 1700s\u000aand 1800s. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">The most inventive parts were in the adventures of\u000aJalpesa, his brother. I wanted him to be a trickster figure, free as a lark to\u000amake mischief in the family, the village, the capital and in Tipu Sultan\u2019s\u000acourt, and even in America. I gave him the fun and freedom he demanded to play\u000aa bigger part in his historical time. I hope readers find him humorous and also\u000alike a Vidushaka, the clown who serves several purposes in classical Sanskrit\u000aplays. For example, he can make a mockery of the British and Europeans in\u000aTanjavur. It was a lot of fun to watch the character of Jalpesa come to life\u000aand cavort around in his own unique ways. By the end of the novel, he has\u000aplayed his part well, and is appreciated.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
