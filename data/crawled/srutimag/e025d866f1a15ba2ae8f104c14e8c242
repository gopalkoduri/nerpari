He is of course referring to innovation in Carnatic music and the late John Coltrane\u2019s is among the great names in jazz. Marquesee is modest when he speaks of his credentials to write on Carnatic music, but his insights are brilliantly direct and praiseworthy in a westerner attracted to but hardly expert in it. He says, \u201cIts history is a history of innovation and broken taboos\u2014relating to gender and caste, public and private. The kutcheri as we know it dates only from Ariyakudi and the 1930s. In a single evening it can include compositions with lyrics in Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, Kannada, Marathi and Hindi. I can\u2019t think of another musical culture with a comparable spread.\u201d</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAnother westerner, Todd McComb of Australia, also seems to have an excellent understanding of the quintessence of our classical music. Comparing the two systems, he says, \u201cMelody and rhythm are likewise more complicated in medieval music than in the more commonly known Western music of the 18th century. Although the music can hardly be said to compare to the sophistication of raga and tala, and especially the elaboration of which modern Carnatic artists are capable, French musical terms of the 14th century curiously mirror Indian music. There is the term \u201ccolour\u201d for the melodic basis of the piece and the term \u201ctalea\u201d for the sequence of beat patterns, broadly called \u201cisorhythm\u201d. \u201d</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a\u201cIt would be naive to suggest,\u201d he continues, \u201cthat 14th century Frenchmen visited India and returned with the ideas of raga and tala (and, at any rate, their music can be extremely complicated in its own way, by way of counterpoint and simultaneous texts), but what can perhaps be suggested is that basic ideas on melodic and rhythmic patterns are natural to the human mind.\u201d</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aCloser home, S. Rangarajan, writing in <i>The Hindu,</i> says: \u201cThe scope for innovation and creativity in Carnatic is as vast and as deep as the seven oceans. There are jetsam and flotsam on the surface of the sea, but can they in any way pollute the ocean?\u201d</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i>Sruti\u2019s</i> mission statement stresses the encouragement of innovation as much as it does the preservation of tradition. But innovation in classical music is akin to changes to the Indian Constitution. It cannot alter the basic structure. Carnatic music has always fostered innovation, as so clearly demonstrated by the introduction of Western instruments, the adoption of north Indian raga-s, and the evolution of the present-day concert format. Yet, we do not want the fundamental character of the music to be diluted or modified in the name of improvisation or fusion. \u2018Organic\u2019 is perhaps the word we may use most meaningfully while describing the path innovation should take.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAmong recent efforts to bring the two systems closer together have been VS Narasimhan\u2019s Madras String Quartet\u2019s presentations of the songs of the great composers of Carnatic music, particularly the Trinity. It is Narasimhan\u2019s dream to arrange these time-tested creations for performance by western symphony orchestras. And Chitravina N Ravikiran seems to have taken the first steps in this direction.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aOn 13 May, the California-based Sacramento Youth Symphony (SYS) Orchestra collaborated with Ravikiran to play a re-creation of a Tyagaraja\u2019s piece arranged for the orchestra. According to a critic, \u201cthe repertoire, carefully chosen by conductor Michael Neumann, kept the Indian spirit even in traditional Western pieces such as <i>The Crown of India</i> suite by Edward Elgar and Kromsky\u2019s <i>Song of India.\u201d</i></div></div>
