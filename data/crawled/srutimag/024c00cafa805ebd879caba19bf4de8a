His grandfather, renowned as Pallavi Vaidyanatha Pillai and his father Ramaswami Pillai were celebrated nagaswara vidwans, known for their expertise in laya. Govindaswami\u2019s mother was Kuttiammal.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Govindaswami\u2019s early lessons were in vocal music, which he learnt from Sambamurthi Iyer. He had become proficient in varnams when he enrolled with Vandkarateru Ramiah Pillai for nagaswaram classes. The teacher\u2019s sons Subramania Pillai and Mamundi Pillai grew up to be accomplished pipers as well.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Govindaswami, who made his concert debut at age 16, was soon joined by his brother Dakshinamurthi, seven years his junior. Soon they gained a reputation for excellence in rakti, regarded as their family heirloom. Viswanatha Pillai and Krishnamurthi Pillai were the youngest brothers., The elder of their two sisters, Dhanabhagyam, married tavil vidwan Pandanainallur Ratnam, while the other sister Sethu married Subramania Pillai, the elder of the <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2013/09/tiruveezhimizhalai-brothers.html" target="_blank">Tiruveezhimizhalai brothers.</a></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">A typical concert of the brothers would feature Govindaswami\u2019s exquisite alapana, invariably followed by Dakshinamurthi\u2019s additional exploration of the raga, after which he would launch a pallavi or rakti, the signal for joyous rhythmic play by the duo.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">It was not unusual for the brothers to separate every now and then, and take other partners, with Govindaswami being joined by Vandikarateru Shanmugasundaram Pillai, and Dakshinamurthi accompanied by Reddiyur Subramania Pillai. Many tavil greats including Needamangalam Meenakshisundaram Pillai, Nachiarkoil Raghava Pillai and Kumbakonam Thangavel Pillai teamed up with the Semponnarkoil Brothers.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">In 1937, the brothers cut their first Columbia disc, accompanied on the tavil by Needamangalam Meenakshisundaram Pillai. They were following in the footsteps of their father Ramaswami Pillai, who was perhaps the first nagaswara vidwan to be featured in gramophone records.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The Semponnarkoil flag was kept flying by such progenitors of the two brothers as SRG Sambandam, SRG Rajanna, SRD Muthukumaraswami and SRD Vaidyanathan.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Govindaswami Pillai passed away on 7 July 1955.

He followed the same musical route as his elder brother\u000aGovindaswami Pillai, learning vocal music from Kasipandaratteru Sambamoorthi\u000aIyer and the nagaswaram from Vandikkaratteru Ramiah. The brothers were a star\u000aduo of their time and the adheena vidwans of the mathams of Dharmapuram,\u000aTiruvavaduthurai and Tiruppanandal. Whenever the brothers performed with other\u000anagaswara partners, Dakshnamoorthi was invariably accompanied on the tavil by\u000aTirumullaivayil Muttuveer Pillai or Tiruppanandal Subbiah Pillai.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">After\u000aGovindaswami\u2019s demise, The younger brother inducted his sons to take turns to\u000aaccompany him on the stage with the nagaswaram. Dakshinamurthi Pillai was\u000acelebrated for his equally delightful rendering of raga and kriti, though he\u000awas most renowned for rakti and pallavi. His complex and challenging swara\u000aprastara in complicated talas or difficult to comprehend eduppu, had a\u000athrilling impact on discerning listeners. </span></div>\u000a<br />\u000a<div class="MsoNormal">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">His\u000asons Muttukumaraswami and Vaidyanathan carried on the tradition after\u000aDakshinamurthi passed away on 12 December 1976. Vaidyanathan, known to be an\u000aavadhani who could play pallavis to two different talas maintained by hand and\u000afoot, is someone whose mentoring such outstanding musicians as Sanjay\u000aSubrahmanyan have sought.&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">(Based on <i>Mangala Isai Mannargal</i> by BM Sundaram)</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
