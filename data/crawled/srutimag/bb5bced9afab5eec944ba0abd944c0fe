The concept of \u2018devotion\u2019 itself has ended up a highly diluted one, she noted, going by the range of content, themes and the kind of proclamations many of the poets and composers have infused in their lyrics. A student and close companion of M S Subbulaksmi for several years, she could easily bring in the emotional appeal in many compositions in several languages through illustrative rendering of select songs. <i>Kaatriniley varum geetam</i> - that immortal song penned by Kalki during a much later period and which is recognised as a song on Krishna - contains an apprehension of the poet as to whether he would be able to keep up the level of supreme devotion forever. And that revealed the humaneness of the composers too. Such outpourings stood to explain the scope of bhakti and it was up to the devotee to utilise it in the right perspective.</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eSajayHKNTA/TuXVr-g-SMI/AAAAAAAAAH8/sZFRAtbUsHY/s1600/2008120551090402.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="304" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eSajayHKNTA/TuXVr-g-SMI/AAAAAAAAAH8/sZFRAtbUsHY/s320/2008120551090402.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Dr Padma Subrahmanyam who handled the pre-noon session was in great form. She began with the statement that a dancer must be a musician first to have a firm grip of <i>Sruti</i> and <i>Laya.</i> <i>Manodharmam</i> would manifest itself only if these basics were secure, she said. There must be an element of d<i>harma</i> (righteousness) lest the efforts went haywire \u2013 a point that went down well with the audience. Padma demonstrated the concept of manodharma for a few songs rendered by her team including the traditional instruments of veena, mridanga and flute. (A votary of tradition, Padma has seldom used the violin in her orchestra). The themes handled by her included facets of <i>manodharma</i> in laya, select items to explain its scope in sanchari passages. As the <i>tukkada</i> piece, Padma presented an interesting sequence of an \u2018open heart surgery\u2019 much to the amusement of the audience which also included Dr. Sunder, a key organiser of the event and a physiotherapist himself.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">At the end, many were convinced that there are no equivalent words in the English language for <i>bhakti</i> and <i>manodharma</i> - the lead themes of the sessions!</span></div></div>
