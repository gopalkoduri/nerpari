For starters, it is one of the\u000afew festivals offering the dancer sufficient remuneration to at least cover\u000acosts, and provide an aesthetically pleasing performance space with more than\u000aadequate facilities. The selection of performers too seems to be based on\u000amerit, with a proper system of gradation between morning and primetime dancers.\u000a</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">The audience\u000aactually pays good money to watch these programmes conducted with professional\u000aefficiency, and in turn gets to witness a reasonable range of genres of dance\u000afrom different parts of India with a neat balance of solo and group offerings. </span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Sruti\u2019s\u000acorrespondents have criticisms and suggestions to make in this and future\u000aissues but there is consensus that despite its shortcomings, the series is one\u000aof the best things to happen to classical dance in Tamil Nadu in a long while.\u000aOne of its best features has been the buzz around it, rarely matched outside of\u000athe Kalakshetra art festival in its heyday.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Kalakshetra has\u000amanaged to hold on to much of its value system through the decades. Though some\u000aoldtimers may complain of falling standards, even its worst critics will agree\u000athat successive directors since the passing of Rukmini Devi Arundale have\u000asomehow managed to prevent serious inroads into the quality of instruction or\u000adilution of the processes initiated by the founder. </span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Similar islands\u000aof excellence do exist elsewhere, and it would be unfair and condescending on\u000aour part to critique institutions with an all-knowing air of superior\u000ajudgement, but the ground reality of the dance teaching and performance scene\u000ais by and large depressing. Most dancers are dancers not because they cannot\u000ahelp dancing or even because they see a good career in dancing (there is none),\u000abut because it is something some parents believe daughters should do as an\u000aadditional qualification. (We are not going into the world of male dancers). </span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">It is an\u000aexpensive proposition, not least because dancers must pay organizers for\u000aopportunities to perform, because there is ostensibly no viable revenue model\u000ato support dance. Absurdly, there is steady demand for dance teachers because\u000ayoung people, mostly girls, still want to learn dance and every dancer who has\u000apaid her way through her performing career can for the first time earn some\u000amoney through teaching dance.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Even with all\u000athe prevalent activity around it, and all the pious proclamations by all concerned\u000aabout how divine this art is, the probability of randomly walking into a good\u000adance programme is significantly lower than that of listening to a good music\u000aconcert selected on a similar basis. However, thanks to the widespread\u000aemperor\u2019s new clothes syndrome, the probability of said dance programme\u000areceiving a favourable review is however not significantly lower. </span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Going by the\u000aevidence all around us, it is difficult not to come to the sad conclusion that\u000amuch ado is made about nothing in our dance world, where unlike in the sporting\u000aarena, there are no rules to identify winners or losers. Mediocrity often\u000amasquerades as merit, and both our public and the media are easily lulled into\u000aa false sense of complacency about the state of our dance. There seem to be no\u000aclearly defined criteria to determine what constitutes good dance, no\u000ayardsticks to measure excellence and no attempts to condemn poor taste. And if\u000athe foregoing is a load of nonsense, I shall be more than delighted to be\u000apersuaded otherwise by people who know better.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
