V<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">By ARS Mani</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Namaskaram.\u2019</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Namaskaram,\u2019 replied the musician in a low voice and said \u2018Please come closer\u2019.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />That\u2019s what the rasikas may have to do to hear him singing in his concerts. Is that the reason some rasikas prefer to sit on the stage? I kept my thoughts to myself.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018The season is already up and running.&nbsp; How is it going for you?\u2019</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Gathering momentum,\u2019 he said. Much like the Indian cricket team trying to find the momentum against England, I thought. \u2018I am giving 15 concerts this season\u2019, he said.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Good luck,\u2019 I said and what I did not say was: Better luck to the rasikas.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018I was at your concert yesterday.\u2019</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Oh! Did you attend? How did you like it?\u2019 I gave long pause. Perhaps he understood that I did not want to be rude to him.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018You know it was only my second concert. Voice is yet to settle down fully. It should get better in the coming days.\u2019</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Are you taking enough precautions with what you eat and where you eat?\u2019</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Yes, to some extent. I am consuming plenty of ayurvedic medicines. I should be fine.\u2019</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The fact is he struggled to reach even the \u2018Sa\u2019 in the <i>mel sthayi</i>. He hardly ventured beyond.&nbsp; Would he really get through the season, I wondered.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018You see the unseasonal rain is causing havoc. Madras is so polluted that a light drizzle is enough to cause a big damage to the voice\u2019.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018You are building up nicely,\u2019 I said. Whether he understood my sarcasm or not, I was not sure!</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018You see, even the cool cricket captain is in hot waters demanding doctored pitches\u2019.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Can you do something similar? Ask for external help?\u2019</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018That\u2019s a 22 yards cricket pitch. This is a 22 mm vocal pitch. Gallons of hot water and strips of medicines give some relief, but they cannot alter the true nature of the voice\u2019.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Underprepared cricket pitches are very helpful according to Dhoni. Can\u2019t you try something like that?\u2019</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018What do you mean by that?\u2019</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Maybe you should reduce your practice sessions\u2019, I said hesitantly.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018When I have 15 concerts to perform, do you think I have time for practice?\u2019</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />That might be the reason, I thought.&nbsp; Like an out of form batsman struggling to find his timing, musicians without practice find it hard to find their range. \u2018Maybe there is a solution to your pitch problem\u2019, I said.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Any new system of medicine?\u2019 he asked eagerly.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Musicians, these days, are techno-savvy. Is it not possible to outsource the pitch?\u2019 I said, seriously, without making eye contact.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />He got my message and said apologetically, \u2018You see we do our best. It is our sincere intention to give a quality concert each time we ascend the stage\u2019.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I said, \u2018I am Sorry. I did not mean to hurt you. I promise you, I will attend your concerts as much as I can,\u2019 and took leave of him.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />For his sake and for the sake of rasikas, I hope he finds his voice range before the end of the music season like Dhoni who hoped (in vain) to find a square turner before the end of the Test series against England.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />More to the point, I hope it will not be as painful for rasikas as it is for cricket fans watching Tendulkar bat.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
