Her voice settled down, as did the audience who were all around her -- sitting on every conceivable spot, on chairs, tables, mats, the floor, aisles, and even standing in a corridor! -- through this song and the <i>Yagnadulu</i> that followed and had opened out brightly by the time she started singing a ravishing Nattaikurunji alapana. <i>Ekkalatttilum</i> was rendered with effortless mastery, with each sangati embellished with ornate, perfectly plotted and executed gamaka-s.</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Rama Ravi surprised us with Tirujnanasambandar\u2019s Tevaram, <i>Kaadalagi Kasindu</i> tuned to Bhairavi, and proceeded to sing a searing neraval and swaram, finding innumerable permutations of notes all to easily to come back to the eduppu. R. K. Shriramkumar on the violin dived headlong into the Bhairavi and shadowed her every movement with infectious enthusiasm and staggering expertise.</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The centrepiece of the evening was a resplendent Sankarabharanam. Subbarama Dikshitar\u2019s <i>Sri Sankaracharyam,</i> not often heard today on the concert stage, was the chosen kriti. After a rather brief niraval and swara prastaram, Rama set the stage for Arun Prakash\u2019s tani avartanam which featured a thrilling section in the misra nadai. The slight dissonance between the audience counting eight as two fours and Arun Prakash keeping sevens to the same time interval possessed a rare unsettling beauty that was only accentuated when he landed on the arudhi and switched back to chaturasra nadai. </span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">We introduced Rama Ravi to the audience as a torchbearer of the Dhanammal bani, and after the concert, she said, \u201cYou put pressure on me with this reference to bani!\u201d There is this quality about the Dhanammal style of music that defies definition, a beauty that cannot immediately be grasped or explained. There are intricate phrases that are minutely tuned and rendered, but can never be accurately represented on paper. The bani wraps every idea within the musical and emotional core of a particular raga or composition, and the individual musician recreates that core that is handed down and decorates it with her own musicianship.</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The two padams performed that evening\u2014<i>Kuvalayakshiro </i>in Gaulipantu and <i>Ninnujuchi</i> in Punnagavarali\u2014were soaked in that bani, and while the rendition was, one felt, more virtuosic than sentimental, it had great emotional depth.&nbsp; Arun Prakash, a master of the minimal, a king of silences, outdid himself in the <i>Ninnujuchi,</i> playing so little that he must have only touched his mridangam ten times during the entire padam. But those ten touches were so expertly placed that they added to the silences, and infused them with the desperate emptiness that the lyric portrays. </span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">This was, for Oli, a most satisfying evening -- a substantial and knowing audience that featured many young musicians and veterans, an intimate venue in musician Aruna Ranganathan\u2019s house, and most important, music of the highest quality.</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The concert</span></b><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">1.

Brinda, when she heard the girl render the padam absorbed from her own radio lesson. In Kalakshetra, Rukmini Devi put the child in the seniors\u2019 class. T. Viswanathan persuaded her to join his department in Madras University rather than the Central College of Music. Hearing her in a competition, D.K. Jayaraman gave her lessons for three years. M.S. Subbulakshmi came to her concerts. Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer remembered her Kambhoji 20 years after hearing her \u2018Adiyokka\u2019.\u2019\u2019</span></i><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Embellished with the technique and <i>pathantaras</i> of such veterans as Mysore Vasudevachar, Brinda, Viswa, Budalur Krishnamurti Sastrigal and M D Ramanathan, along with a natural flair and a voice suited for the glides and microtones of the Dhanammal <i>bani,</i> Rama Ravi\u2019s music is a delectable treat on both intellectual and emotional levels.</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Her brand of music, with the emphasis not on performance, but on the internalization of aesthetics and on great conviction in one\u2019s style, has ardent followers amongst musicians and non-musicians alike. </span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i><b>R K Shriram Kumar,</b></i> virtuoso violinist and vocalist, hails from a family of musicians. He trained under his grandfather, the celebrated violinist, R K Venkatarama Sastry, Savitri Satyamurti and V V Subramanyam, besides his tutelage under D K Jayaraman for vocal music. In a performing career spanning almost two decades, he has absorbed and assimilated the styles and <i>pathantaras</i> of several doyens while accompanying them.</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">His adherence to classicism, understanding of <i>banis,</i> the tonal purity of his violin, sense of proportion and his vast repertoire help enrich every moment of a concert and make him an extremely sought after accompanist.</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i><b>K Arun Prakash</b></i> is a well known and popular mridangist known for his sensitive accompaniment. His father, L Krishnan was a renowned composer and disciple of the inimitable G N Balasubramanian. A disciple of M N Kandaswamy Pillai, Arun Prakash&nbsp; is a torch bearer of the Palani <i>bani</i> of playing. He upholds all that this school is famous for: deft and nimble fingering, <i>kalapramana suddham,</i> unintrusive and emotive laya patterns that adorn every composition and above all, <i>saukhyam.</i></span></div></div>
