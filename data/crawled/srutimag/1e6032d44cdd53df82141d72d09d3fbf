The Kedaragowla varnam was followed by another businesslike Hamsadhwani, laced with a spicy swaraprastaram. The swara designs\u2014as they were throughout the concert\u2014were intelligent without being clever, perfectly interlocking within the scheme of the raga and the kriti without sounding planned, and rendered with a spontaneous ease that belied their knottiness.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">On the best of days, Athana is a ragam that defies clear definition. Musicians over the years have relied as much on lakshya as lakshana to bring out its flavours, for its lakshana is elusive and, perhaps, continuously evolving. Thiagarajan\u2019s swarams for Narada gana lola, thriving on the raga\u2019s eccentric nishadam and its relationship with the dhaivatam, panchamam, shadjam and rishabham, found that lakshya core. S. Varadarajan\u2019s responses on the violin\u2014shadowing the kriti, improvising sangatis, jamming on the swaras, probing the vocalist\u2019s ideas\u2014were thrilling.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">A peer often understands an artiste\u2019s art better than a rasika. When N. Ramani, who was supposed to play on this day but could not due to illness, asked the Oli Team to invite OS Thiagarajan, he specifically requested Thiagarajan to sing <i>Ekamresa</i> in Shanmukhapriya. \u201cHis Shanmukhapriya is special,\u201d Ramani told us. And he was right. Thiagarajan invested the raga with abundant rakti. Spinning a raga alapana as if it were a story of the journey of the panchamam through Shanmukhapriya\u2019s contours, he sang with verve, simmering intensity and imagination.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mysore Vasudevarcharya\u2019s <i>Sankari</i> in Pantuvarali was an exercise in saukhyam\u2014a word for which there seems to be no exact English equivalent. Arun Prakash\u2019s ideas while following Misrachapu talam can be special, and when he played for the niraval, Thiagarajan and Varadarajan seemed to be feeding off his rhythmic patterns, developing them into round after round of measured fireworks. The connection\u2014perhaps subconscious\u2014between the raga and the patterns Arun Prakash uses to underline it, was revealed by a close scrutiny of his playing for Athana, Hamsadhwani, Shanmukhapriya, and the Kharaharapriya that followed.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The concert until this point was a build-up to a grand Kharaharapriya. Toying with the raga\u2019s many shadja-panchama intervals\u2014like the shadjam and the panchamam, the rishabham and the dhaivatam, the gandharam and the nishadam, the madhyamam and the shadjam, the panchamam and the rishabham\u2014Thiagarajan made the alapana a sumptuous feast. Varadarajan, in complete command of the emotional core of the ragam, provided a response brimming with emotion. Fittingly, the composition chosen was Tyagaraja\u2019s <i>Mitri bhagyamu.</i> After all, it was the bard who shaped Kharaharapriya\u2019s distinctive identity.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When he accepted to sing for Oli, Thiagarajan admitted that he had never sung without amplification, and that he would take this as a challenge. If this was a challenge for him, it didn\u2019t show. He sang with such effortlessness\u2014his voice didn\u2019t strain in the tara sthayi, or struggle to be heard in the mandhra sthayi either\u2014that the audience did not miss the microphone one bit. It was a supreme performance by a master who, we feel, is a little underrated.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Varnam - Kedaragowla - Adi - Tiruvotriyur Tyagayyar</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Pahi pahi - Hamsadhwani - Rupakam - Chidambara Bharati</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Narada gana lola - Athana - Rupakam - Tyagaraja</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ekamresa - Shanmukhapriya - Adi - Muthuswami Dikshitar</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sankari - Pantuvarali - Misrachapu - Mysore Vasudevacharya</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mitri bhagyamu - Kharaharapriya - Adi - Tyagaraja</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Viruttam - Sahana</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Vandanamu - Sahana - Adi - Tyagaraja</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Naadupai - Madhyamavati - Khandachapu - Tyagaraja</span><br /><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mangalam - Sourashtra - Adi- Tyagaraja</span></div>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
