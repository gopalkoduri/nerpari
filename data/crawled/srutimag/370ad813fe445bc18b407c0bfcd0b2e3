It had many distinctions to its credit.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aIt was a farewell function for Dr. Thomas, who was the Director of the Alliance Francaise at Chennai. Dr. Thomas and Mrs. Nhung Thomas, were ardent connoisseurs of Carnatic music. Closely known to both the parties, I was actively involved in the programme as facilitator and organiser.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aIn the Western musical tradition, from which the violin has been adapted, it occupies the pride of place as the \u2018king of instruments\u2019. The soloist stands and holds the violin on his shoulders and wields the bow in full range. There is an air of majesty about it. The practice in India has been different, to suit the gamaka requirements of our system.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAs we planned a mikeless concert in deference to the wishes of the couple and as a special tribute on the occasion, we had a rehearsal earlier, to check the acoustics of the hall, with Jayaraman playing from different positions on the stage. We then decided to place the platform, not in the centre of the stage as is usually done, but more to the front \u2013 closer to the edge of the stage near the orchestra pit. It worked out exceedingly well. The desired effect was achieved to full satisfaction.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe hall was packed with an elite audience, which was treated to a sumptuous feast of violin music \u2013 without mikes.</div></div>
