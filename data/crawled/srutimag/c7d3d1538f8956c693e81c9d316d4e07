In the mainstream, not\u000aeven a handful of amateur theatre groups offer more than fluffy comedies. And\u000aunlike the vibrant atmosphere in the English theatre world of Chennai, albeit\u000aoften of dubious quality, its Tamil counterpart does not enjoy much audience\u000asupport.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Things were much better for the stage industry in the last century. While\u000aentertainment (other than films) in the Chennai of the 1950s and sixties consisted\u000amainly of Carnatic music, the city also offered a monthly dose of amateur\u000atheatre. If your earliest ideas of classical music were fashioned by the voices\u000aand instruments of the stalwarts of the day\u2014Ariyakudi, Semmangudi, Madurai\u000aMani, Maharajapuram, GNB, MS, MLV, Pattammal, Palghat Mani, Lalgudi, Krishnan\u000aand many more\u2014Tamil drama offered considerable variety too.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aSuch dramatisations of the novels and novellas of Devan as Mister Vedantam,\u000aTuppariyum Sambu or Kalyaniyin Kanavan were popular hits. A Tamil version of Dr\u000aJekyll and Mr Hyde, in which the lead roles were played by the towering CG\u000aSeshadri, was so frightening that the walk home afterwards could be a nightmare.\u000a<i>If I Get It</i> by YGP was a thriller all\u000athe way with never a dull moment, at least to an impressionable pre-teen fan.\u000aUnforgettable was Koothapiran or NV Natarajan, who is still going strong, with\u000asome six decades of experience on radio and stage behind him.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe great dramas of the period were staged by the TKS Brothers, with TK\u000aShanmugham and TK Bhagavathi playing major roles in all their lavish spectacles.\u000aShanmugham was so convincing as <i>Avvaiyar</i>\u000athat when the wonderful K B Sundarambal played the sage-poetess on the screen,\u000ait was initially disappointing to note the role taken away from TKS. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The eponymous <i>Kappalottiya\u000aTamizhan </i>&nbsp;and <i>Veerapandia Kattabomman</i> were both runaway successes and both\u000aeventually had Sivaji Ganesan essay the star roles in his inimitable style on\u000ascreen.<br />\u000a<!--[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><br />\u000a<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Another veteran theatre personality was SV Sahasranamam whose Seva Stage\u000awas a highly respected troupe. <i>Nalu Veli\u000aNilam, Policekaran Magal</i> and <i>Nawab\u000aNarkali</i> were among their evergreen hits, some of which were filmed\u000asuccessfully. RS Manohar was known for special effects and gigantic sets as\u000amuch as unconventional perspectives on well known myths and epics. His plays\u000ahad Manohar in roles such as Ravana in <i>Lankeswaran</i>,\u000a<i>Sukracharya</i> and <i>Naganandi</i>.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe stage décor was predictably theatrical in most of these productions, with\u000apalaces, streets and temples painted on scene-specific drop-down-roll-up\u000abackdrops. Comic relief was mandatory and actors like Sarangapani, Sivathanu\u000aand Sambandam drew the most laughs.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br />\u000aThe 1960s also brought to the fore such larger than life theatre personalities\u000aas United Amateur Artistes\u2019 YGP, whose son Mahendra is still going strong on\u000astage and in films, and K Balachander. In Balachander\u2019s Ragini Recreations\u000aflourished such future stars of the screen as Sundarrajan and Nagesh.\u000aSundarrajan\u2019s stirring performance as Major Chandrakanth prefixed the title of\u000athe army officer permanently to his screen name and the brilliant comedian\u000aNagesh\u2019s <i>Server Sundaram</i>, adapted for\u000acinema, became an all-time classic. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Viveka Fine Arts\u2019 \u2018Cho\u2019 Ramaswamy\u2019s plays, a complete departure from the\u000aprevailing genre of \u2018social\u2019 drama, lampooned the political classes and their\u000acorrupt way of life that was increasingly pervading Indian society. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">A later development was the growth of light drawing room comedies of the\u000astrictly Madras variety, the handiwork of natural humorists not distinguished\u000aby hidden depths or subtlety. \u2018Kathadi\u2019 Ramamurthi, SV Shekher, and Crazy Mohan\u000abelong to this category. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">When Poornam Viswanathan, originally famous for his work on radio and\u000athe play, \u2018Under Secretary\u2019, moved from Delhi to Madras, he found a superb\u000aoutlet for his acting ability in the productions of Kala Nilayam, in which\u000aalong with committed amateur artistes of the calibre of Chandrasekhar (of the\u000amusically talented Sikkil family) and others, he was able to take part in such\u000asuper hits as Savi\u2019s <i>Washingtonil\u000aTirumanam</i> and Marina\u2019s <i>Tanikkudittanam</i>\u000aand <i>Oor Vambu</i>. Kala Nilayam is still\u000agoing strong despite the odds stacked against it.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Viswanathan later formed his own group to stage some excellent works of\u000aserious content, mainly plays by Sujatha, such as <i>Kadavul Vandar</i>. Indira Parthasarathi\u2019s <i>Nandan Kathai</i>, <i>Aurangzeb</i>and\u000a<i>Ramanujar</i> are again serious works,\u000awhich like Poornam\u2019s earlier efforts, lack support from sponsors and audiences\u000aalike, a sad commentary on the prevalent theatre culture of Tamil Nadu. Parthasarathi\u2019s\u000aplays have met with far greater stage success in their Hindi translations than\u000ain the Tamil originals.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Theatre of the old Nawab Rajamanickam or Boys Club kind is still\u000areputedly alive and kicking all over the state, besides therukoothu and other\u000aforms of folk theatre, but urban Tamil Nadu has the reputation of not\u000asupporting or enjoying serious Tamil theatre any more. &nbsp;In fact, a worthy\u000arecent attempt to revive Sujatha\u2019s <i>Kadavul\u000aVandar,</i> by Bharati Mani\u2014a character actor who has relocated here from Delhi\u000apost-retirement\u2014had to be funded entirely by him. For all the favourable\u000areviews and audience response the play has received, Mani will still not find\u000ait easy to obtain sponsorship for further productions of serious plays. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The lure of cinema and television is blamed for the lack of an informed,\u000ainterested audience for plays other than the joke-a-second or slapstick\u000avariety. The huge crowds that Magic Lantern\u2019s <i>Ponniyin Selvan</i> drew a few years ago at the YMCA Open Air theatre,\u000ahowever, suggested that the blame for the situation did not lie with the\u000aaudiences alone.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aThe last few years have seen a surge in the number of theatre festivals (more\u000aabout these will follow soon) in Chennai, usually staged at venues like the\u000aDakshnamoorthy Hall of Mylapore and Narada Gana Sabha. Some of the plays,\u000aincluding a few by troupes from Delhi and Mumbai, even the USA, have attempted\u000aserious themes, or relatively sophisticated comedy, in a departure from the\u000aMylapore formula of yore, but the productions often suffer from lack of\u000ainfrastructure as well as training. The sets are a throwback to the era of\u000aManohar and TKS Brothers, or even worse, imitations of TV plays with their\u000astrange furniture and stranger interiors. The actors often stand in front of\u000amicrophones and declaim their lines to the audience, and the acting belongs\u000astrictly to realm of melodramatic excess. Yet no one seems to mind. It is time\u000aboth our theatrepersons and our theatregoers were exposed to quality fare from\u000aother parts of India.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a</div>\u000a</div>\u000a
