What an enchanting setting for enthralling music!</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThere were many things the Oli team was worried about when we fixed Vyasarpadi Kothandaraman\u2019s nagaswaram concert at Spaces in Besant Nagar. Will there be an audience for a nagaswaram concert at a venue unfamiliar to Carnatic music audiences? Will there be too much noise from a Saturday evening crowd at the beach? What about the mosquitoes? But half an hour into the concert, when a contoured, booming mandara sthayi nishadam in Bhairavi reverberated around the garden, our doubts became irrelevant. Here was a maestro, in complete control of his art, exploring the heaviest of ragas as delicately and unhurriedly as duskfall, to an intimate, knowing audience.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aNagaswaram concerts without microphones are not novel, for the instrument was designed to be performed in the open air as part of moving processions, but surprisingly, Kothandaraman admitted at the end of his concert that it had been a while since he had played without any amplification. \u201cThere are microphones at weddings also these days, you know... It took me a few minutes to adjust to this setting,\u201d he said.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe lack of amplification brought its own special effects. When the nagaswaram is pointed at you, it is significantly louder than when it is pointed away from you. Also, when Kothandaraman raised it off the ground and held it aloft, it did look and sound as if he was calling out to someone in the skies. And when he rotated it in a vertical circle, mirroring the phrase he played, the sound seemed to travel in that circle, passing you for a brief moment before visiting the others in the audience!</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe two main raga alapanas of the evening, Bhairavi and Nattakurinji, revealed the fact that Kothandaraman doesn\u2019t explore ragas through ascending and landing swaras; he explores them around sangati-s. He tosses off a phrase, and then he waits for it to sink in - not just into the audience, but into himself. He then builds another one around the first, pauses again, the pause slightly shorter than the first, and follows it up with another variation of the same theme. Then comes another flourish, and another, and another, in quick succession. He throws a volley of sangati-s coiling around one another until they come back to where they first started. Then he takes a break to adjust his seevali, Kongampattu Murugayyan fills this gap with some swinging tavil rhythms. Kothandaraman signals his readiness with the next phrase to explore.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAfter he explored Bhairavi in this manner, one grand sangati after another, he launched into Syama Sastri\u2019s magnum opus, the <i>Kamakshi</i> swarajati. The swara and sahitya, each sounding distinct from the other, were peppered with the most authentic Bhairavi inflections and accents - one glide from the panchamam to the shadjam during the penultimate swara-sahityam drew a collective sigh from the entire audience. We were no longer in Besant Nagar under a sidelit banyan tree; we were in Kanchi and Kamakshi was listening to the leisurely, majestic swarajati sitting amidst us.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe Nattakurinji raga alapana, ending in a crescendo, with Kothandaraman and Anandan (on the accompanying nagaswaram) trading whirlwind phrases in rapid succession, was followed by a rare display of tanam on the instrument accompanied by the tavil, followed by an uncomplicated pallavi highlighting the raga\u2019s inherent symmetries. The energy of the concert was held aloft through Murugayyan and Sethuramam\u2019s tani avartanam, with complex patterns rolling off Murugayyan\u2019s fingers with consummate ease. The tani avartanam might just have been a little lengthy for a two-hour performance, but that was a small excess in what was a remarkable evening.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAs Gowri said in her thank you speech, we hope to hear Kothandaraman play Nilambari the next time!</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b>The programme</b></div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Mallari - Gambhiranattai \u2013 Misra Triputa<br />\u000aMarugelara - Jayantasri - Adi - Tyagaraja<br />\u000aKamakshi - Bhairavi - Misrachapu - Syama Sastry<br />\u000aHimagiritanaye - Suddha Dhanyasi - Adi - Harikesanallur Mutthiah Bhagavatar<br />\u000aRagam-Taanam-Pallavi - Nattakurunji - Adi<br />\u000aArabhimanam - Ragamalika - Adi - Tarangambadi Panchanada Iyer</div></div>
