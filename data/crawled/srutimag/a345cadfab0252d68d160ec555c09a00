This promising young vocalist is an accomplished violinist as well, known to be the ideal accompanist \u2014 supportive and unobtrusive despite her virtuosity \u2014 and an appealing soloist, not to mention her excellent showing as an accompanist in the violin kutcheri-s of her guru T. Rukmini.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aBelonging to a family deeply interested in Carnatic music \u2014 grandmother Sankari Nagarajan was a graded AIR vocalist \u2014 Amritha enjoys a pedigree that includes some outstanding guru-s in vocal music, the late K.R. Kedaranathan and Meera Kedaranathan prominent among them. While Rama Ravi of the Brinda-Muktha school has been another notable influence, Amritha has recently started training with P.S. Narayanaswamy. Amritha\u2019s early violin learning was from Vitthal Ramamurthy, before she came under the tutelage of Rukmini.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAmritha is evidently a believer in the importance of listening in a young musician\u2019s career, for she, along with her parents, is one of the most visible rasika-s at concerts. Amritha\u2019s parents encouraged her to learn both music and Bharatanatyam at a young age. Her mother in particular has been a bulwark of support in her concert career.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aA strong preference for gamaka over briga, a penchant for subtle prayoga-s, feeling supported by intelligent concert planning that ensures the right length of raga alapana, niraval and swaraprastara, are some of the qualities coming in for praise in the reviews of her vocal concerts.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAmritha\u2019s solo violin concerts have been few and far between, though her violin playing is marked by the same qualities of saukhyam and solid musicianship as her singing. She finds playing the role of accompanist a good learning experience, helpful in her vocal concert career, which is \u2018her first priority\u2019 in her own words.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAmritha has to her credit a number of titles and prizes including the M.S. Subbulakshmi Award from Narada Gana Sabha, Chennai, the All India Radio National Competition Prize, prize for the best vocalist in the junior category from the Madras Music Academy and in the sub-senior category from the Indian Fine Arts Society, Chennai. Her prizes for violin playing include the Lalgudi Gopala Iyer Endowment Prize from Sri Krishna Gana Sabha, the K.S. Mahadevan Endowment Prize from Narada Gana Sabha, the Best Junior Violinist Award \u2013 Spirit of Youth Series 2003, and the Lalgudi Gopala Iyer Award and Lalgudi Jayaraman Prize for the Best Sub-Senior Violinist from the Music Academy, Chennai.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShe has performed at major sabha-s in Chennai and elsewhere in India. She has also performed at the Tyagaraja Utsavam at Cleveland, Ohio, as well as other centres in the U.S.A. This summer Amritha played the violin for Chitra Visweswaran\u2019s dance recital at Cleveland and other parts of the U.S.A.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aA graded artist of All India Radio in both vocal and violin music by virtue of winning the All India Radio competition, Amritha is an alumnus of P.S. Senior Secondary School and Ethiraj College, Chennai. She holds a Masters degree in Finance Management and is now pursuing her MBA with Symbiosis, Pune.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHer talent, her steady progress as a performing musician, ably guided by excellent teachers, and her level headed approach to life, promise a notable career in music for Amritha Murali in the years to come.</span></div></div>
