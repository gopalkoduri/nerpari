Uncle Vazhuvur Veeraswami Pillai, a nagaswara\u000avidwan, was Govindarajan\u2019s first music teacher and parent as well, after the\u000aboy was orphaned at the age of three. His aptitude for the violin took the lad\u000afirst to Mayavaram Bhootalingam Pillai and later to the venerable Kumbakonam\u000aRajamanickam Pillai. He acquired yet another guru in Simizhi Sundarappa Iyer,\u000afrom he learnt numerous kritis.

He was scrupulous to the core in financial matters, even\u000areturning part of the fees if he felt he had been overpaid. With his students,\u000ahe was kindness personified. One of his prime disciples Sikkil\u000aBhaskaran\u2014Kuttalam Vaidyalingam Pillai was another\u2014is one pupil who remembers\u000ahis gurukulavasam with him with affection and gratitude.
