ARCE houses one of the largest collections of recordings of Indian music and oral traditions.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Anushka and Iswar had the full benefit of a live performance in this first meeting. \u201cWe climbed up a hill overlooking a monastery. When we looked down, we made out people working in a field, moving to a rhythm. Every time the breeze turned, we would hear something.\u201d So Iswar and Anushka scrambled back down to the valley to get a closer look.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />A group of mostly women workers were ploughing a barley field using shovels. All the while, as they moved along the field with complete coordination, the workers were singing songs in the local dialect of Boti. Two men were drawing a yak, while the women were helping break down large mounds of upturned earth into smaller clumps.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cWhile we were on the field, we worked independently of each other\u201d, says Anushka, who had her camera with her, but decided not to use it. \u201cUsually if it\u2019s Hindi, he (Iswar) talks and I film, but since they were women, we switched roles. I tried to participate in whatever they were doing.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Anushka, who has no experience dancing or performing, recalls: \u201cWhat from the outside looks like such a simple movement requires so much intricacy, so much grace. It\u2019s not just the physical labour. It\u2019s not just that I\u2019m not strong enough, or didn\u2019t have the muscles or haven\u2019t done this kind of work all my life.\u201d The body movements and the singing of the Spiti valley workers, she realised, were not merely functional. They involved a particular kind of aesthetic, performative elements intimately wedded to the work, so that both movement and music were \u201cmore than what\u2019s needed just to plough the field, more than what sounds in song.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />On the periphery, Iswar was registering his own impressions with the camera. \u201cIt was like watching a choreographed piece on stage, with a lot of improvisation happening.\u201d In Iswar\u2019s mind\u2019s eye, the field became a stage. \u201cThis is the length. This is the breadth. Here are these bodies moving across the space with these kinds of coordinated movements. There\u2019d be a burst of song. Then, they\u2019d be digging and singing. Suddenly, they would stop, sit and chat, crack jokes, the laughter would echo everywhere. Then, one group would split off and go somewhere else. Suddenly, fifteen people would come together, then, split up into seven groups of two.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />In the midst of all this human action, \u201cthe yak would come and go once or twice. A guy would be singing to it. He said, instead of whacking it, you can sing to it, it listens better. So he would sing, occasionally tapping the yak gently on the rear. I just kept running from one point to another, taking in all these frames, recording how they would seamlessly form patterns in the course of their work.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />What Iswar and Anushka found out, to their surprise, as they talked to the workers, who were in the fields from sunrise to sunset, is that they owned the land. \u201cSpiti is covered in snow for six months,\u201d Anushka explains. \u201cThe other six months is when you can actually work on the land. Hardly anything grows there; it\u2019s barren, cold desert. So the people there have to make the best of the time they have. They really enjoy working\u2026 they get to be on the land, see each other\u2026 It\u2019s not a cooperative in the strict sense, perhaps, but if you\u2019re old, or sick, people will come and work on your land. The only arrangement is, the person who owns it will feed everyone puri-s for that day.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />But things are slowly changing in Spiti. Three labourers from Bihar were working that evening side-by-side with the locals. \u201cThey were new to the job,\u201d Anushka says. \u201cNo one was telling them what to do. But in this long formation of ten-twelve women and two-three men, they could not work without falling into the rhythm.\u201d Iswar noticed this pattern as well from his vantage point behind the lens. \u201cI\u2019d watch the newcomers. They\u2019d walk over where something was happening, wait, wait, wait, and fall into place.\u201d Anushka interjects: \u201cIt\u2019s raw. It\u2019s not taught. That was what was so nice about the three guys just joining in. You want to join. I don\u2019t feel like that, no matter how beautiful a stage performance is, though I may be in awe, [I don\u2019t feel] that I want to be part of this right now. The encounter with work music forms did that for me. They made me realise that this is how I want to live.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>Into the unknown</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />When Anushka and Iswar began their adventure into the unknown, they had itchy feet, some vague idea of travelling and filming musicians and performers across India, letting their documentary unfold in some unplanned, organic way, with little to no commentary on the action. Their journey through Himachal Pradesh and Spiti had begun in Mcleodganj, and so through to Tabo, beloved of the Dalai Lama. It was part of a longer \u201ccrowd-funded\u201d sojourn, embarked on by two free spirits who decided to start a blog (something we have always wanted to do. wordpress.com) and request friends and relatives to donate to their one-of-a-kind travel film project.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />After an initial online appeal for funding, Anushka and Iswar set forth from Chennai to Delhi, where a friend loaned them a second video camera. They were advised to start their travels in Rajasthan, where tourists were welcome and accommodation was cheap and relatively easy to find. So, they travelled through Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, and a little village called Khinchan, where they were welcomed by a largely Jain community that took care of what they call \u2018khurja\u2019, some 15,000 odd Siberian cranes that migrate to the area during the winter! It was here, in Khinchan, that they began filming barren streets lined with deserted havelis, that they were told are opened up only once a year. The owners of these gorgeous, traditionally built homes have apparently migrated to Sowcarpet, in Madras! \u201cWherever we went, there was always a Chennai connection,\u201d laughs Iswar.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />After Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, the adventurers came back to Chennai for a staging of Rajiv Krishnan\u2019s critically acclaimed Miss Meena, in which Iswar was to perform. Then, they were back on the road again, travelling through the northeast: parts of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland and Manipur. En route, they had all sorts of filmic encounters with street and train performers, hippies and sadhus, textile weavers at the loom, school teachers and children, the famed archers of Shillong, and crossover-folk musicians in Imphal, to name a few.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />But it was not the city streets, nor the religious sites, nor proscenium performances, nor the visits to popular must-sees orchestrated by friends or locals that really spoke to the two. Something else did.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />What Anushka and Iswar began to realise that evening in the field in Spiti was that they each had an abiding romance with the everyday, a fascination with performance that \u201cwasn\u2019t supposed to be performance, but looked performative to us.\u201d Project U-ra-mi-li (meaning song of the people in the Chokri dialect) evolved out of such moments spent with farmers, workers, weavers, potters, and street vendors. The sight of the workers singing and moving in sinuous patterns on the Spiti field now forms the nucleus, the vital core, of their endeavour as they continue their way around India in what now appears to be at least a two-three year project, \u201cthough we didn\u2019t actually verbalise this at the time.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />But there\u2019s more. Anushka and Iswar are painfully aware of the slow disappearance of the performing traditions they are filming, communal traditions that have existed for centuries in a performative continuum from the field to the stage, now under threat of extinction or commodification. In Arunachal Pradesh, for instance, only the older generations still know and sing in the local dialects. Oral cultures passing down tonal languages, or languages without scripts, now have to compete with organised education, schools that teach Hindi, English, and Assamese. In Rajasthan, a local puppeteer lamented the disappearance of patronage, of knowledgeable audiences. Now people there only want popular Bollywoodised versions of folk numbers, not nightlong performances of mythological stories and legends for which they were formerly famed.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />There are rewards that go beyond the artistic for the filmmaking duo. \u201cEverywhere we\u2019ve been, in urban and rural places, from people on trains, to people in cities and villages where we stayed, were invited into homes,\u201d says Iswar. \u201cWe were adopted by local families. People fed us, gave us a place to sleep. If they did not invite us to stay, it was because they thought we would not be comfortable sleeping on the ground. If we offered money, they would say, don\u2019t ruin the mood. Think of it as our contribution to your venture. That\u2019s why our list of producers for the film is so long. People across the country, probably across the world, want to be happy, live in a peaceful state, no matter what\u2019s happening politically. People take care of you.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Iswar and Anushka are now attempting to raise funds for a second phase of filming through south India via OrangeStreet (<a href="http://www.orangestreet.in/">www.orangestreet.in</a>), an online fundraising platform for socially engaged art projects. More information about the Uramili project, its founders and the film is available at <a href="http://www.uramili.in/">www.uramili.in</a>.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
