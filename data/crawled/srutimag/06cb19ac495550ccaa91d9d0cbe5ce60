Though Lalgudi G Jayaraman had not been in the best of health\u000afor a couple of years now, news of his death has been received with shock and\u000adisbelief by his legion of followers.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">So many senior musicians, many of them\u000aoctogenarians, paid condolence visits to the Lalgudi home\u2014as they did, not long\u000aago, when fellow violin maestro M.S. Gopalakrishnan passed away. It was a\u000amoving experience to witness the genuine emotion and profound sense of loss\u000aexhibited by these veterans, but it also gave us much food for thought\u2014about\u000ahow close to the end of their own innings some of them are. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Despite age and infirmity, there is much music and\u000awisdom in the best of these grand old elder statesmen (and ladies). It is up to\u000aus to ensure the documenting and dissemination of their ripe knowledge.\u000aFortunately, Chennai has in recent years seen a surge in the number of private\u000aand public initiatives in this regard. In the case of Lalgudi Jayaraman, the\u000aSruti Foundation conducted a seminar &nbsp;in the 1990s on his music, spearheaded by Dr N Ramanathan, musician and musicologist, and now a\u000amember of Sruti\u2019s advisory board. Its recording constitutes a valuable resource\u000afor musicians and music scholars. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Much valuable work was done in the area of\u000adocumenting and recording for posterity some of the riches of the vanishing\u000aheritage in classical and folk music by Sampradaya, the pioneering\u000aChennai-based archival institution, which has in recent years languished for\u000awant of funding. With some of our greatest artists already in the late evening\u000aof their lives, we need to strengthen the hands of such institutions, lest we\u000aare forced to rely on our memories to retain the authenticity of our musical traditions.</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">With the\u000apassing away of Lalgudi Jayaraman, one of the most iconic and charismatic of\u000athe Carnatic musicians of the last century, we have lost a traditionalist not\u000aaverse to innovation, especially as a composer, and whose interests included\u000acollaborative endeavour, both with other musicians and in dance compositions.\u000aHe was one of those responsible for the spread of Carnatic music beyond the\u000acognoscenti and for drawing young listeners into its fold. He leaves behind\u000adevoted disciples and many admirers among young musicians devastated by the\u000aloss. While Sruti\u2019s coverage of the Lalgudi legacy has been extensive and in\u000adepth, we hope to revisit it in a fitting manner in our June issue.<b>&nbsp;</b></span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><b>Kittappa Pillai</b>&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia;">It continues to be the season of centenarians.\u000aWhile we at Sruti are still catching up with acknowledging artists who\u000acompleted a hundred last year, we are happy to feature in this issue a tribute\u000ato Bharatanatyam guru Kittappa Pillai, a descendant of the Tanjore Quartet, by\u000aour senior associate Nandini Ramani. We are also happy to reproduce in </span><i style="font-family: Georgia;">Pages\u000afrom the Past </i><span style="font-family: Georgia;">a comprehensive article on Kittappa Pillai written by\u000athe late S Ramaswamy, an assistant editor of Sruti then. The first Indian\u000abranch manager of Burmah Shell, Ramaswamy was an ardent devotee of Tyagaraja\u2019s\u000amusic, and offered much wise counsel to the Sruti editorial team in its\u000aearliest days. As the grandfather of Bharatanatyam dancer Srividya Natarajan,\u000ahe came to know her guru Kittappa Pillai quite closely. This happens to be\u000aRamaswami\u2019s centenary year, too.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
