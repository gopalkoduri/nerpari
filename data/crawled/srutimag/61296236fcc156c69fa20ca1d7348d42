V<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">By V Ramnarayan</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The first song I learnt in Todi was the varnam <i>Eranapai,</i> which my sister and cousin had to sing over and over again until their teacher, the <i>pattu vadyar</i> who came home, nodded his approval. Kalyani was of course <i>Kamalambam bhajare</i> in my mother\u2019s lovely voice, as she sat before the family deities on Friday evenings.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Soon I learnt to recognise Hindolam through <i>Bhajare Gopalam,</i> and its Hindustani equivalent Malkauns through <i>Man tarpat,</i> the Mohammad Rafi song from <i>Baiju Bawra.</i> <i>Chalamelara</i> in Margahindolam was a favourite as Amma sang it regularly, but I did not know the name of the raga then, nor did I know that <i>Vijayambike</i> was in Vijayanagari, though I knew both songs backwards. I was all of nine or ten. I knew of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja</a> and <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_2206.html" target="_blank">Dikshitar,</a> because <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja</a> signed his songs with his name and <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_2206.html" target="_blank">Dikshitar</a> gave away the name of the raga within the song (<i>Guruguha</i> did not enter my consciousness yet), but <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_28.html" target="_blank">Syama Sastri</a> and other composers were strangers to me still.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I knew Mohanam and Bhairavi through varnams in the ragas, and Hamsadhwani by <i>Vatapi Ganapatim bhaje,</i> but also a strange assortment of compositions in <i>Ramanannu brovara</i> (but had no idea it was in Harikambhoji), <i>Munnu Ravana</i> (I knew it was Todi, because I already knew the varnam), <i>Saranam, saranam</i> (I knew it was Asaveri, and could vaguely identify songs in that raga on the rare occasions I heard them in concert or on the radio, <i>Sangeeta gnanamu</i> in Dhanyasi and <i>Sarasijanabha sodari</i> (I could recognize both ragas thanks to these two songs; they made such a strong aural impression that a couple of years ago I was able to correct a senior vidwan who mistook a Nagagandhari alapana for an exploration of Jaunpuri during a concert, purely on the basis of my memory).</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I knew some other ragas, too, but on the basis of film songs, not necessarily of the uplifting kind. For instance, I recognized Arabhi from <i>Erikkarai mele poravale pennmayile,</i> Suddhadhanyasi from <i>Brindavanamum Nandakumaranum</i> and Shanmukhapriya from another film song I cannot recall right away now.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I also managed to learn ragas like Surati and Chenchurutti through some Tiruppavai songs my periappa Sundaresan tuned for us youngsters to learn for a competition at the Balasubramania Swami temple at Teynampet. Eventhough the field was not very competitive, I managed to do badly, thanks to a violent attack of nerves.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The famous ragamalika <i>Bhavayami Raghuramam</i> was doing the concert rounds in the 1960s when I was entering college. I was always drawn to the Nattaikurinji segment of the song,&nbsp;but for years did not even know the name of the raga, and even after learning it, tended to forget it all the time\u2014somewhat like a besotted young man unable to recall the face of the object of his affections. Whenever I heard the raga again, I was always reminded of the words <em>Dinakaranvaya tilakam</em> while struggling to recall the raga\u2019s name.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Surprisingly I could tell Anandabhairavi and Reetigaula apart without much effort unlike some of my more knowledgeable friends, but Purvikalyani and Pantuvarali always posed a few problems, as did a whole host of Shanmukhapriya-like ragas. Latangi and Kiravani, I was glad to learn, can stump at least one famous musician\u2014by his own admission.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Just in case I have impressed the reader by the use of the past tense in the foregoing paragraphs, let me confess: I still practise good old hit and miss when it comes to raga identification, but happily, I can enjoy any raga, lose myself in any raga, even if I can\u2019t put a name to it. There are few that I dislike, in fact none, thanks to the sheer beauty of raga music and the marvellous way good musicians treat ragas. Listening to lec-dems on ragas, ragalakshana and ragabhava by the likes of R Vedavalli, RK Shriramkumar and Sriram Parasuram has enhanced the raganubhava severalfold for me.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
