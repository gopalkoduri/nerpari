The reason may be the lack of archival material on artists. Lalitha Ram, who has authored an excellent book on GNB, has now come out with a biography of mridanga maestro Palani Subramania Pillai.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">N. Murali, President of the Music Academy lauded the effort of the author while releasing the first copy of the book to musicologist B.M. Sundaram, to whom it has been dedicated. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">It was Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavatar who promoted Palani, a left handed mridanga vidwan, when violinists refused to change their place in the dais. Kumbakonam Rajamanikkam Pillam offered his place to Palani and sat on the right side of the vidwan, so that <i>valanthalai</i> of the mridanga could face the audience. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Murali recalled that Chembai offered four tani avartanams to Palani in his concert, impressed by his mridanga excellence. He quipped that the time taken by Palani for all the four tani-s then was now taken by the present day mridanga vidwans for a single tani.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Sangita Kalanidhi-designate Trichy Sankaran spoke reverentially about his guru Palani and dwelt on his honesty and integrity. His guru and Palakkad Mani Iyer had mutual respect, he added. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">B.M. Sundaram, known for his forthright views, asserted that Palani was number one in his art. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Lalitha Ram acknowledged the role played by K.S. Kalidas, B.M. Sundaram and others in shaping the book and thanked the publisher Solvanam Publications, Bangalore.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Sruti Janaki was the master of ceremonies.</div></div>
