Kanyakumari</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-03IO4sLlxk0/UpmEs_05m6I/AAAAAAAAD_8/KjYM_d8Qens/s1600/Sudha.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-03IO4sLlxk0/UpmEs_05m6I/AAAAAAAAD_8/KjYM_d8Qens/s320/Sudha.jpg" width="259" /></a></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I first met Sudha in 1976 at MLV Amma\u2019s residence. She had come to learn vocal music from MLV through a scholarship. She sang Dharmavati that day and I could sense that Sudha had a bright future. It is challenging to play for, or sing along with a vocalist as great as MLV. You had to be very alert and extremely intelligent to grasp MLV\u2019s creativity and spontaneity. And Sudha had it all \u2013 intelligence, grasping power, sincerity and a malleable voice as sweet as honey. You must listen to Sudha\u2019s Tamil Eelam recording done years ago to believe this. I cannot recall now, but for some reason MLV Amma could not record for the CD.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />MLV Amma\u2019s concerts were planned to suit the audience\u2019s mood, response and interest. Having spent years on-stage singing beside her guru, Sudha has also learned this concert planning. MLV gave Sudha appropriate chances in concerts which highlighted her vocal credentials and capabilities. I remember Sudha sang the tara sthayi sangatis brilliantly. Sudha proved her talent on the spot whenever given a chance by her guru.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Sudha is a sincere musician. Be it a sabha concert or a marriage kutcheri, she does not compromise on either the quality or the repertoire. This is yet another attribute which Sudha has imbibed from her guru.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oNgvKNI8fVk/UpmEzLdiJEI/AAAAAAAAEAE/c1YFazeNQRQ/s1600/Sudha+-+Kanyakumari.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oNgvKNI8fVk/UpmEzLdiJEI/AAAAAAAAEAE/c1YFazeNQRQ/s1600/Sudha+-+Kanyakumari.jpg" /></a></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Those days there was this practice of reviewing and discussing each artist\u2019s performance \u2013 the dos and don\u2019ts \u2013 after a concert or a tour. Sudha was always a keen observer, and improved and gained a lot from these discussions. She has very well absorbed the \u201cMLV bani\u201d. I recollect Sudha\u2019s mother was very particular that her daughter should travel with me, she was confident that I would take care of her.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Sudha\u2019s efforts, hard work and guru bhakti have all contributed to her making a mark in the music world. She must be appreciated for being successful for so many years, living up to the expectations of her rasikas and for achieving so much in this field. My blessings and best wishes to Sudha Ragunathan.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
