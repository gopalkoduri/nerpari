V<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">By MV Swaroop</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cPark your car in that corner, you won\u2019t be able to take it inside the street,\u201d the old lady said, hauling a mridangam from the back seat on to her shoulders. I parked the car, picked up the other mridangam, the heavier one, and followed her. With a sprightly gait that belied her age - she was seventy-two - and unmindful of the weight of the mridangam on her shoulder, she turned into the most invisible of gullies that led to this sprawling network of narrower gullies.</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cThey really should fix that streetlight,\u201d she said, pointing to this dark pole. It was eight-thirty in the evening, and it was too dark to even tell if there was supposed to be a light on that pole. Then she realised, \u201cOh, there\u2019s no power!\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">She shined a torch from her phone, and took a right turn into a gap between two buildings only wide enough to admit a small motorcycle. Even a malnourished Royal Enfield wouldn\u2019t make the cut. The buildings on the street were locked in a tight embrace, covering every inch of space, almost growing into one another, sharing walls, terraces, balconies and doors. Compound walls were forgotten as a concept, breathing space was given a go by, and the view from any window was only another one. Even in near darkness, I could sense that I had stepped into another age. I had to remind myself that I was still in Central Madras.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">She stopped at a narrow iron gate leading to a long, tapering, snaking corridor lit by two tired bulbs and lined by three worn out motorcycles. \u201cWe have a small generator - I can use one light and one fan when the power is gone,\u201d she said. At the end of the corridor was a dull blue door that had surely seen happier times. When she opened that door, a new world unfolded behind it. I didn\u2019t realise that there was so much space behind that iron gate. Her torch light revealed more iron gates next to the one we entered, and I wondered if all of them hid worlds like this.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cI used to live closer to the tank, but the owner wanted the house back for his daughter\u2019s family,\u201d she said, \u201cBut this is not too far from the tank. I walk down, sometimes, but I\u2019m growing a little old, no? I am looking for a house closer to the tank, though.\u201d I smiled. Civilisations grew around water bodies, I had read in my history classes, but I couldn\u2019t believe that proximity to a tank was still a prime consideration for choosing where one lived.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a</div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">On the ground floor was another blue door, of the same construction as the one outside, and the indistinct hum of a Tamil serial - that mix of pounding background music and thundering melodrama - floated from behind it. I thought I heard a child scream, but that might have also been the serial.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">In the corner of the corridor was a closeted flight of stairs that had been standing for half a century at least. I didn\u2019t ask her how old the building was, but the stone stairs had a particular kind of construction that suggested that era. \u201cThank you so much for coming. You see how difficult it would have been for me with two mridangams up these stairs.\u201d The stairs were steep, and the mridangam I was carrying was boring into my shoulder. If the walk were a little longer, I might have needed a little break. \u201cYou\u2019re carrying the big one,\u201d she said, \u201cI can\u2019t even lift that anymore. It\u2019s that heavy. But that <i>nadam...</i>\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">We reached a landing that was almost cruelly taken over by a large and incongruous asbestos door. She unlatched it, and led me into what used to be the landing - it had a tap in one corner, a chair and two pairs of slippers on a tiny wooden shelf - now converted into her sit-out. She kept up the chatter, as she fumbled through her handbag for the keys to the inside door. Her nephew, a well-known mridangam player himself, lived in the next street, she said. The neighbours here kept to themselves, she hardly knew who they were, she complained. \u201cThey don\u2019t even come and talk, you know,\u201d she moaned. She still gave me a fairly detailed biography of the family living in the house watching the Tamil serial.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The inside door said, \u201cMridangam and vocal classes\u201d in a scribbled Tamil handwriting. No one could see this board when the asbestos door was shut. I wondered if the door was a new addition.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">She found the key, finally, and opened the door and led me into a room that was not much wider than the door itself. On one side of the room was a wooden bench with two pillows on it. The other side of the room was a thin shelf that held a bewildering assortment of things. She put her mridangam on the bench, and I followed her. There were two more mridangams in that room, both standing proudly on their toppis. I walked up to one and struck it. \u201cTom!\u201d it rang across the house. I was quietly proud that even though I hadn\u2019t played one in three years, I could still get a clear tom out of it.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The narrow room ended in another door, beyond which there was a columnar kitchen, about two-thirds the length of the first room. \u201cThat\u2019s about the entire house,\u201d she said, proudly, \u201cThe first room is where I sleep and take mridangam classes. This is the kitchen. And there,\u201d she said, pointing to another hidden door on the right side of the kitchen, \u201cis a bathroom.\u201d The entire house was built like two coaches of a train with a toilet and bathroom in the vestibule.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">A thought struck me - it would be nice to disappear into a house like this, in a gully like this for a few months. It was hidden away from the madness of mainstream Madras, but it was still right there, in the centre of it all.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cSit down,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll make coffee.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I had to go back to a friend\u2019s concert, I protested. I\u2019ll come back another day, definitely, I promised. \u201cIt will take me five minutes to make you the coffee,\u201d she insisted.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">My friend would be most upset if I missed her concert, I said. Another day, one-hundred percent, I assured her.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cAt least have some kali,\u201d she said, \u201cToday is a special day for Nataraja. You know that, no?\u201d My grandmother had mentioned something in the morning, and so, guilelessly, I nodded. She hurriedly put some kali on a steel plate and handed it to me. Suddenly, she said excitedly, \u201cOh wait. I wanted to show you. I have Anna\u2019s photo here on the wall.\u201d I looked. It was her famous older brother, and it was the photograph most widely released to the press. \u201cA very nice photo. He looks so happy!\u201d She attended almost every one of his concerts in Madras, \u201cI am not able to travel too far these days. You know, Anna plays in places like Madipakkam and Annanagar... Then I can\u2019t come. But otherwise, I come, somehow or the other.\u201d And she always sat in the front row, and enthusiastically kept talam for the stage.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Next to her brother\u2019s, was her own photograph. She was with our dark-glassed leader in it, receiving an award. \u201cKalaimamani,\u201d she said, as I finished my kali and handed the plate to her, and added, \u201cYou can wash your hands in that sink,\u201d like the two were a part of the same thought. I looked closely at the photo. I had heard strange things about that particular award, about when, why and to whom it was given, but she didn\u2019t look like she could pull any strings.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">There was another photo next to it, a still from a popular Tamil film. I remembered that scene well - a bunch of mamis reinterpreting a popular Hindi song Carnatic style at the behest of a man dressed as a mami. There she was in that still, in the left-hand corner, playing the mridangam. I remember being amazed by the fact that they had actually found a mami to play the mridangam.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I smiled, as I bid her goodnight and walked out the door, but I couldn\u2019t help wondering, if, given her talent, she would have led a different life as a man.</span></div>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
