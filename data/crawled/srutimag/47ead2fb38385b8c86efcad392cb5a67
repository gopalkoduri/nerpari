V. Sivasubramanian, ailing for more than three months, passed away yesterday. He was 79. He is survived by two daughters and a son. Hundreds of his admirers and musicians thronged his Triplicane residence to mourn his death.

V. Mani passed away last night of an acute heart attack. He was bedridden with multiple ailments for more than a month, and had resisted being shifted to a hospital. His children, all living abroad, will arrive in Chennai shortly for the last rites.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aBorn in Tiruvarur in 1930 to Vaidyanatha Iyer and Komalatammal, N. V. Mani grew up in Madras where his father worked as an accountant. The teachers who taught him music in his childhood have all vanished into obscurity, and it is rumoured that he learnt most of his manodharma music from <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_4571.html" target="_blank">T. N. Rajarathinam Pillai,</a> the nagaswaram maestro, whom he used to accompany to numerous concerts. <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB\u2019s</a> music, it is said, had a great impact on him. It would not, however, be inappropriate to state that he was largely self-taught.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAround 1943, much to his father\u2019s resentment, Mani quit school to join a drama company in which he acted and sang. Acting as Abhimanyu in a play, the thirteen-year-old Mani achieved instant fame for his music. Singing at a striking 5-kattai, Mani unleashed an exhilarating Todi, Kedaragowlai and Ahiri amidst others on the audience. So popular was his singing that he played Abhimanyu for more than ten years after he was clearly too old for the role.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aSimultaneously, Mani\u2019s popularity as a Carnatic vocalist was rising. His youthful, playful voice, his searing tarasthayi brigas, his supersonic swaraprastaram resulted in a burgeoning fan base even before his voice had settled into adulthood. It was around this time, that he began to assimilate kritis just by listening to maestros sing them. An unhappy stint at the Music College ensued. He was said to have been admitted without basic schooling on Musiri Subramania Iyer\u2019s insistence. He unfortunately felt the rigorous, academic atmosphere dampened his manodharma, his music was losing its spontaneity\u2014and quit within a year. After disappearing from the Madras music scene briefly, he resurfaced as the boy who sat behind <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_4571.html" target="_blank">Rajarathinam Pillai</a> at all his concerts.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAround 1958, N.V. Mani\u2019s name began to be heard again in music circles. His singing was still thrilling, it was still fast-paced, but it seemed to have lost the manic energy of his early years. It started acquiring the depth and stretches of contemplativeness that he came to be known for.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aIn the interim, Mani married Srividya, his neighbour in Triplicane. It was an alliance forced on him by his brothers who were worried he would lose his way as a musician. It was a happy marriage and they had a son and a daughter.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aIn 1963, he first performed at the <a href="http://www.musicacademymadras.in/" target="_blank">Music Academy</a> during the December season to a sellout audience. Since that year, until 1986, he was a permanent fixture at the Academy - on the 25th of December. In that period, he rose from a young cavalier to a senior statesman in the most dignified manner, being accompanied by stalwarts of three generations on the mridangam and the violin. His playback singing for the popular movie <i>Mohanagaanam</i> starring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_Ganesan" target="_blank">Gemini Ganesan</a> as an alcoholic musician made him a household name.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHowever, a vague illness in 1986 waylaid him for two years. Again, nobody knew where he was. When he came back, he looked ten years older, and his music had acquired sobriety to the extent of being almost melancholic. In the next ten years, his music remained highly inward looking and probing. The frenzy of the first phase of his career had disappeared completely. It was as if a different musician had emerged. He lost his popularity to a cult status.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aIn 1997, he suffered a major double-blow. He lost his ancestral Triplicane house in litigation to his cousin, and Srividya passed away. Unable to deal with the loss, and forced out of his home, Mani moved to the US where he lived with his son for three years. The harsh climate and a dislike for the States\u2019 lonely environs brought Mani back to his beloved Chennai. His brother gave Mani a small house in Mylapore where Mani lived with his students till his death.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aWith his passing, Carnatic music has lost one of its most original and unique voices. It has lost a man who is responsible for ideas that musicians will play with for generations. It has lost its mad scientist.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span> </span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aObituary, <a href="http://www.sruti.com/" target="_blank">Sruti Magazine,</a> January, 2010</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a<b>Reclusive, obscure, magical</b></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aForty years ago, I was at a wedding of a distant relative who worked in the movies when I heard the most magnificent Todi raga alapana of my life. The singer explored the contours of this most mysterious raga for more than an hour, probing each note, each level, each turn. Every now and then, he would go quiet, focus on the drone of the tambura, and unleash ecstatic phrases of incomparable genius. The Todi had everything - those traditional stamp-like gamakas, unusual combinations of swaras and uncharacteristic plain notes. The crowd at the wedding milled around, as ever, listening to snatches of the concert when they got too tired of talking to one another or gawking at the stars that came to the wedding. I don\u2019t know what about that setting inspired him to sing that Todi. It was noisy, the sound system was primitive. It was a Madras summer, and fans were turned off around the stage so as to not disturb the tambura. He was drenched in sweat even before he began. But he sang as if he were in a universe all his own, and that unearthly Todi, like the music of the Gandharvas, did not stand on the strength of the swaras, but on the microtones in between those swaras. It was music for the gods.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHis last public concert was at the Vinayakar temple in Besant Nagar on a Thursday November evening. A small crowd, undaunted by the rain, was treated to a lovely ragam-tanam-pallavi in Kedaragowlai. The concert also offered Gowlai, Mayamalavagowlai, Ritigowlai and Kannadagowlai! He finished the concert in a hurry and announced, \u201cMy wife is ailing. In the hospital... I shall sing more for you another day...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aSrividya passed away that night, and he never sang publicly again. When my uncle, a close friend of his, asked him about it, he said, \u201cI performed, all these years for her. I can\u2019t anymore...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMany fans, since, have gone to his house to listen to private concerts. He obliged most people who came to hear him. Sometimes, he called his friends for private music sessions. He would sing with two students, accompanied by two tamburas, for hours together. The biggest musicians of our times attended these concerts, which had no structure, no limits, no plan. Often, he would launch into a raga alapana after the kriti, niraval would be done on three or four lines, the other musicians would join in, pallavis were composed, explored and dissected on the spot. And at the centre of it all was the man himself - lost in his music, striving to understand his art better.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aN. V. Mani, NVM to his fans, Mani to his friends, Mama to his students, passed away last evening, almost twelve years after he last performed on stage. Yet, there was a huge gathering at his house - fans, many of whom looked too young to have actually heard him live; students, some of whom barely learnt a song from him; musicians, many of whom he\u2019d fought with; and relatives, who hadn\u2019t cared for him for years. Such was the power of his music. He might have left us, but his music will linger for years.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a<i>(The February edition of <a href="http://www.sruti.com/" target="_blank">Sruti</a> will carry the last interview of N. V. Mani - a conversation over four days in November 2009 with Ajith Ramachandran.)</i></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith stood nervously at the door, waiting for it to open. He had rung the bell four times now. Each time, a tired ring echoed around the house, but no further sounds were heard. The doors and windows on the ground floor were all shut. There was a large lock on the main door, but on closer inspection Ajith found it was not actually locked \u2013 the bolt was there only to create an illusion. The house looked uninhabited, almost as if it was under litigation. Even the bicycle in the front verandah looked unusable. A tree had merrily grown right into the portico, and was threatening to consume the entire building with its branches.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHe walked around the house, through a garden that had grown, out of disuse and neglect, into a wild, thorny thicket. On the eastern side, he opened a window that was slightly ajar. It seemed light had not penetrated through these walls in months. He peeped in to find a cobwebbed room with a few pieces of broken furniture. There was a wooden stick on the inside, just about reachable from where he was. He picked it up and struck the nearest piece of furniture. It made some noise, but it wasn\u2019t enough to elicit any reaction from whoever was in the house. He screamed into the room, but again, to no avail.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith wondered if the man had forgotten the appointment, or if he had given him the wrong address and started to leave. He barely reached the gate when a voice called him, \u201cHello! Sir!\u201d Ajith turned around to find a young man, around his age, with a moustache and thick glasses standing at the balcony on the first floor.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201c<a href="http://www.sruti.com/" target="_blank"><i>Sruti</i></a> magazine?\u201d the man asked.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYeah...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWait!\u201d he called out, and disappeared from the balcony, only to appear at the front door and open it. He was wearing only a towel, and his hair was still wet. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I was in the bathroom, and Mama can\u2019t walk down the stairs.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cOh, no problem...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cCome in. Mama has been waiting.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThey walked into a sparsely furnished house. There was a wooden bench in the front room, three plastic chairs in the drawing room, and two more in the dining room. \u201cI\u2019m Shankar, Mama\u2019s student...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cAjith Ramachandran.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHello,\u201d he paused, and took off again, \u201cThis house is unused. Mama and I live upstairs. He\u2019s not well at all... Doesn\u2019t even have the energy to make trips to the toilet. But he\u2019s very enthusiastic. When T.V. Sankaranarayanan came last evening, they both sang Bhairavi!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThey smiled politely. Shankar led Ajith into a bedroom, where, on a creaking bed, Mani lay, wrapped in a blanket, a smile pasted on his face. Shankar left, presumably to wear some clothes.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cSo. You are the kid they\u2019ve sent?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cSir, I\u2019m Ajith...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThey must\u2019ve sent you to get one last interview before I pop it?\u201d he said, still smiling. Ajith turned more nervous than he already was. He managed to mumble, \u201cSir... No... I was genuinely interested...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHe laughed. Then he said, \u201cPull up that chair, sit down... I\u2019m being such a bad host.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShankar!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI think he is changing,\u201d Ajith said, placing an old wooden chair by the bed.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, could you just open the curtains a bit? So dingy in here...\u201d Ajith got up to open the curtains. Mani spoke again, \u201cWhat does <i><a href="http://www.sruti.com/" target="_blank">Sruti</a></i> want to know about me now? Everything is known...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cActually, <i><a href="http://www.sruti.com/" target="_blank">Sruti</a></i> was not too keen on this story. The editor said they had already done a cover story on you. I wanted to interview you,\u201d Ajith replied, the open curtains letting mid-morning sunlight into the room.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cLet me guess. You\u2019ve heard some old recordings from some website, and you\u2019re a fan or something.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cNo. I read a couple of articles in <a href="http://www.vikatan.com/" target="_blank"><i>Ananda Vikatan</i></a> on your two unexplained disappearances. That interested me.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re frank. I like you.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith seated himself on the chair, and said, \u201cThe interview can take a few sittings...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani was still giggling, \u201cI\u2019ll call you whenever I feel up to it. You\u2019ll get whatever you want before I die.
