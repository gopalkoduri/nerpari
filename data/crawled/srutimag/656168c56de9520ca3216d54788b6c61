Evident in his concerts are good training, attitude and manodharma. For one so young, his music is mature.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAt present a student of vidwan PS Narayanaswami, Bharat Sundar started learning Carnatic music at the age of six with Gayathri Mahesh, a senior disciple of veteran vocalist OS Thiagarajan. He continued lessons with vidushis Leelavathi Gopalakrishnan,a disciple of TS Balu, who in turn, was a sishya of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_25.html" target="_blank">GNB.</a> Leelavathi\u2019s son G Srikanth, a well known singer for bharata natyam, has also mentored Bharat who has received specialised instruction in pallavi singing from Trichy J.Venkatraman and Srimushnam Rajarao. Bharat is also learning percussion. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aAs a child, Bharat Sundar performed in over 600 concerts as a member of Ramjhi\u2019s Issai Mazhalai, a prominent music group featuring children. He has travelled widely with the group in India and abroad. His exposure through Issai Mazhalai has been a great preparation for Bharat\u2019s concert career.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHis performances in the last couple of December seasons have provided evidence of a major prospect in the Carnatic music world. Writing in <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/" target="_blank">The Hindu,</a> critic Viswanath Parasuram, praised him for his \u201cdexterity of voice, good sense of the kriti, manodharma in raga alapana, niraval and kalpanaswaram, talakattu and concert craft\u201d. \u201cThere is ample evidence that he has and continues to receive good guidance from his gurus,\u201d said the critic, who advised Bharat to try to make his voice fuller, rounder and stronger in the lower registers. Viswanath advocated greater soukhyam in Bharat Sundar\u2019s music, and we could not agree more. The introduction of that element would indeed make Bharat Sundar a more complete singer.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aBharat Sundar has been noted for the brilliance of his alapana, and his brave exploration of ragas beyond conventional phrases. He has also regularly displayed felicity and pleasant aesthetics in the way he articulates lyrics and sangatis. As we said before in Sruti, here is a bright prospect\u2014if his head stays firmly on his shoulders.</span></div></div>
