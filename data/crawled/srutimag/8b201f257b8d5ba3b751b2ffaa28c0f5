Khan-saheb, he wrote, was "<span style="color: #262626;">both\u000ajoyful and guileless". This assertion struck a chord, for I've always\u000aassociated Sehwag's batting with another Indian classical musician, <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_02.html" target="_blank">Madurai Mani Iyer,</a> whose music was often described in those very terms\u2014joyful and\u000aguileless. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #262626;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_02.html" target="_blank">Mani Iyer's</a> music makes you sway from side-to-side, it makes you\u000atap your feet, it puts a ear-to-ear smile on your face. His music is audacious,\u000ait is irresistible, and when he gets going on those long swarakalpana flights,\u000ait seems almost unstoppable. He can be funny, he can be cheeky. He can make\u000ayour heart skip a beat with the most pure phrase, and he can make you raise\u000ayour eyebrows with something unexpectedly unorthodox. His music is for the\u000alaymen, his music is for the experts. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #262626;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Sounds like Sehwag?<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #262626;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">But the more I listen to <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_02.html" target="_blank">Mani Iyer,</a> the more I discover how much\u000ais hidden below the surface. It is joyful, yes, but it possesses depth that\u000aisn't usually associated with joy. It is weighty, and again, that word doesn't\u000aalways go with joy. It is more scholarly than it initially seems, and somehow,\u000athe scholarliness rests lightly on its shoulders. It is pristine classical\u000amusic, steeped in tradition, soaked in history. That sort of music is supposed\u000ato be obscure, inward, pondering. Not joyful, right? <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #262626;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The cliche about Test Match batting is similar. It takes years\u000aof training, years of experience. It is supposed to be a slow grind. Tantric\u000aconcentration is key. Physical and mental stamina must work together with\u000atechnique and judgment to erect monuments. It is supposed to bring joy to those\u000awho know what goes into it and be inscrutable to others. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #262626;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Sehwag inverts that idea of Test Match batting, like <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_02.html" target="_blank">Mani Iyer</a>\u000adid with classical music. His batting is carefree; he often sings when he bats.\u000aHis batting is intuitive, it is impulsive. His batting isn't about control, it\u000ais about letting go. His batting is visceral, it is overpowering. Still, Sehwag\u000ais first a Test Match batsman, because, like Mani Iyer's music, his batting has\u000apathos, his batting has weight, his batting is scholarly. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #262626;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Sehwag's technique is underrated. While his feet don't move as\u000amuch as the purists would like, his balance is faultless. In economy of\u000amovement, Sehwag has almost no parallel in his generation. Even so, he gets\u000ainto great positions, he gets his weight behind the ball, he generates power,\u000ahis timing is almost otherworldly. When he is batting at his best, there is not\u000aone extra flourish, not one unnecessary movement. If that isn't great\u000atechnique, I don't know what technique is. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #262626;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_02.html" target="_blank">Madurai Mani Iyer's</a> swara-improvisation is marked for its\u000a"sarvalaghu" -- a way in which he spontaneously builds patterns and\u000astructures of notes, almost unendingly, one after another, like torrential\u000adownpour. Nothing is planned, nothing is pre-set. But following that intuitive path\u000aof "sarvalaghu", <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_02.html" target="_blank">Mani Iyer</a> created edifices of notes and patterns of\u000asuch spectacular imagination, executed with such ease and clarity. Musicians\u000astruggle to create equivalents with meticulous planning! It sounds easy when\u000ayou hear it -- he just seems to be singing what comes to him at that point in\u000atime -- but it is more difficult than to just reproduce plans. It needs an\u000ainnate grasp of a dimension of the art that is most elusive -- its philosophy.\u000a<a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_02.html" target="_blank">Mani Iyer</a> grasped that, just like Sehwag understands the philosophy of Test\u000aMatch batting. Neither might be able to put that philosophy in words, but one\u000acan tell from their art (ask CLR James, batting is an art) that they know\u000asomething subconsciously that most others don't. That insight is what makes their\u000aart joyful.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a</div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #262626;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Serious health issues deprived <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_02.html" target="_blank">Mani Iyer</a> of his voice at the\u000apeak of his powers. He came back, singing at a lower pitch, now more a senior\u000astatesman than a young maverick. He performed until the day he died. I hope\u000aSehwag comes back from being dropped, perhaps settling for a lower, more\u000acomfortable pitch, to delight us with his most unbridled brand of batting for\u000asome more years.&nbsp;</span></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
