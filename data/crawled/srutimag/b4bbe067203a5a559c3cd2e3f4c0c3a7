Among other things, Mitra had been the architect of Rukmini Devi Arundale\u2019s dream project, <i>Meera of Mewar,</i> back in 1985 at Kalakshetra.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mitra was at the time working as a senior executive of a British multinational in distant Ambattur Industrial Estate, and taught music at his Adyar residence on Saturday mornings. He composed some lovely tunes for the Meera dance drama, and it was a special experience to watch the compositions unfold, and his new found south Indian sishyas grapple with the challenge of overcoming their strong Carnatic background to make Meerabai sound authentic. </span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Falguni Mitra, like his father and guru, Pandit Shib Mitra before him, held a day job, practising dhrupad only in his spare time. In fact, it was his father\u2019s stint as an engineer in the motorcycle manufacturer Enfield India, that first brought young Falguni to Madras in the late 1950s. Studying at Vivekananda College and later Madras University where he studied philosophy at the postgraduate level, Falguni delighted in soaking in the Carnatic music of what he describes as its golden period. As he was already an All India Radio artist, he came into contact with the charismatic vocalist GN Balasubramaniam or GNB, then chief producer of AIR Madras. Drawing his attention to the similarities between dhrupad-dhamar and ragam-tanam-pallavi of Carnatic music, GNB told the young man, \u201cCarry on the lofty tradition of dhrupad,\u201d adding that as he grew older, he would gradually shed ornamentation and go deeper into the music.\u201d How true, Mitra was to find out over the years.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">A memorable experience for young Falguni was accompanying his father in a lecture demonstration at the Music Academy\u2019s annual conference in 1958 or thereabouts. By 1960 when he was a postgraduate student he was regularly interacting with some of the great names of Carnatic music and bharatanatyam. Besant Gardens, Adyar, was home to Kalakshetra and the giants Rukmini Devi had surrounded herself with\u2014such as the great composer Mysore Vasudevachar, scholar extraordinaire Sankara Menon, and the iconic vocalist MD Ramanathan. Guests at his father\u2019s home included visiting maestros of Hindustani music like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Amir Khan\u2014who used to stay with bharatanatyam legend Balasaraswati. The neighbours in quiet Kasturbanagar were treated to top class Hindustani music during these celebrity visits.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cRukmini Devi was the greatest personality I have ever met,\u201d says Mitra. When Falguni Mitra went back to Madras in the 1980s to work there, she remembered him as the boy she had met decades earlier. \u201cMy brother has heard your father\u2019s guru ustad Nasiruddin Khan in Indore. I have great respect for dhrupad with its vast raga development,\u2019 she told him.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Listening to Falguni Mitra\u2019s music, Rukmini Devi was impressed enough with his creativity to ask him to compose the music for a dance drama on Meera she was planning. The genre was something Rukmini Devi had made her own, with the Ramayana series at the Santi Niketan-like grounds of Kalakshetra, her singular contribution to India\u2019s artistic wealth. Working with Meera bhajans setting a few of them to new tunes was a huge challenge that Mitra approached with some trepidation, especially as there was very little time to prepare for the event. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a number of Carnatic musicians. Show no mercy, reject them if they can\u2019t master the diction,\u201d Rukmini Devi told him, and indeed that was the one serious problem he faced. After much hard work, the premiere went off without a hitch, and full of praise for Mitra, Rukmini Devi spoke of an improved production in the coming years, but that was not to be, as she died next year.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">In the audience were MS Subbulakshmi and husband T Sadasivam, and meeting them led to yet another interesting collaboration for Falguni Mitra. That is a story for another day.</span></div></div>
