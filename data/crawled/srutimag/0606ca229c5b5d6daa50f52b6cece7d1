Imagine my surprise when she agreed to do a role\u000ain&nbsp;<b><i>Flame of the Forest,</i></b>&nbsp;a play I wrote and directed,\u000awith the kind of enthusiasm rare even among actors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="color: #222222;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="color: #222222;">Star dancer though she was, \u201cI\u2019ll do it again,\u201d became her refrain at\u000aplay rehearsals. She unhesitatingly admitted doubts, seeking guidance in\u000alearning this new skill. After finishing her scenes, she invariably stayed to\u000awatch other actors in rapt silence. She had to know the whole to actualise her\u000apart.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="color: #222222;">Priyadarsini Govind\u2019s role in the play was of a betrayed lover and war\u000avictim, struggling to find peace within. As a theatre director, I found it\u000aexhilarating to watch her grit in grasping the elements of the new craft. At a\u000arecent workshop she admitted, \u201cI had to start from the basics, even learn how\u000ato walk naturally on the stage.\u201d She polished every detail until it became a\u000aspontaneous, shining inner experience. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="color: #222222;">After this, I got to direct Priya in two dance theatre performances. In\u000athe first production she had no ego hassles in partnering a less experienced,\u000ayounger dancer. \u201c<b><i>Through Sita\u2019s Eyes</i></b>\u201d was our second\u000acollaboration; Priya explored the psychological growth of this archetypal\u000awoman, as envisioned by poets in six languages. Blending instinct with\u000aintrospection, she individuated every phase of the character \u2013 from carefree\u000ainnocence to disillusionment. Perceiving Sita\u2019s trauma peaking not when\u000aabducted by a demon, but when abandoned by her husband, Priya transformed\u000aSita\u2019s odyssey into the ceaseless striving of the human spirit against eternal\u000aodds.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="color: #222222;">An unforgettable rehearsal moment came when shy Sita identifies her two\u000amale escorts to the curious tribal women in the forest, \u201cThe dark one is my\u000abeloved, the fair one my brother-in-law.\u201d As the trio move on, I asked Priya to\u000aturn and glance at the villagers. I still get goose bumps when I recall Priya,\u000akneeling as a village woman saying farewell to the visitor, rising as Sita, and\u000awalking away with a backward look under her delicately raised pallu. That\u000asingle glance captured the essence of the character\u2014brimming with fellow\u000afeeling, warmth and lucent soul bonding.&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="color: #222222;">Though Priya had been talking for sometime about \u201cgiving back something\u000ato the art that has given me so much\u201d, her appointment (July 2013) as the new\u000adirector of Kalakshetra, Chennai, came as a bolt from the blue. Starting with\u000afounder Rukmini Arundale, this 77 year old performing arts institution has been\u000aheaded by \u201cinsiders\u201d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Trained by gurus belonging to other schools,\u000amore solo performer than guru or group choreographer, Priya has no\u000aadministrative experience either. While her artistic standing is unquestioned,\u000asotto voce apprehensions are rife about her ability to fulfil the role of\u000adirector of an institution internationally famous for its elegant aesthetics,\u000apedagogical training, and inspired ensemble choreography.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="color: #222222;">To start as an outsider may be daunting. But is it an insuperable\u000adisadvantage? Especially if the entrant has no problems with starting as an\u000aearnest novice in a new field? With team spirit? Ready to consult, listen to\u000asuggestions? Meet challenges? \u201cYou talk about theatre, this is life,\u201d you may say.\u000aBut are they so different? Aren\u2019t ego-shedding sraddha and sadhana as vital in\u000alife as in art?</span></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
