For starters, it is one of the\u000afew festivals offering the dancer sufficient remuneration to at least cover\u000acosts, and provide an aesthetically pleasing performance space with more than\u000aadequate facilities. The audience actually pays good money to watch these\u000aprogrammes conducted with professional efficiency, and in turn gets to witness\u000aa reasonable range of genres of dance from different parts of India with a neat\u000abalance of solo and group offerings. <i><a href="http://www.sruti.com/" target="_blank">Sruti</a>\u2019s</i> correspondents may have\u000acriticism and suggestions to offer in future issues, but the consensus is that\u000adespite its shortcomings, the series is one of the best things to happen to\u000aclassical dance in Tamil Nadu in a long while. The buzz around it has rarely\u000abeen matched outside of the Kalakshetra art festival in its heyday.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Kalakshetra is one institution that has\u000amanaged to hold on to much of its value system through the decades, though some\u000amay complain of falling standards. Even its worst critics will agree that\u000asuccessive directors since the passing of Rukmini Devi Arundale have somehow\u000amanaged to prevent serious inroads into the quality of instruction or dilution\u000aof the processes initiated by the founder. </span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Similar islands of excellence do exist\u000aelsewhere, and it will be condescending on our part to offer gratuitous advice\u000ato the dance world, but the ground reality of the dance teaching and\u000aperformance scene is by and large depressing. Many dancers are dancers not\u000abecause they see a good career in dancing (there is none), but because it is\u000asomething some parents believe daughters should do as an additional qualification. (We are not going into the\u000aworld of male dancers). It is an expensive proposition, not least because\u000adancers must pay organisers for opportunities to perform, with ostensibly no\u000aviable revenue model to support dance.&nbsp;</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Ironically, there is steady demand for\u000adance teachers because young people, mostly girls, still want to learn dance\u000aand every dancer who has paid her way through her performing career can for the\u000afirst time earn some money through teaching dance.</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Even with all the prevalent activity\u000aaround it, and all the pious proclamations about how divine this art is, the\u000aprobability of randomly walking into a good dance programme is significantly\u000alower than that of attending a good music concert. However, thanks to\u000awidespread naivete of the emperor\u2019s new clothes variety, the probability of said\u000adance programme receiving a favourable review is not significantly lower. On\u000athe flip side, criticism can be harsh and unjustified if equally uninformed.</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">It is difficult not to come to the sad\u000aconclusion that much ado is made about precious little in our dance world,\u000awhere unlike in the sporting arena, there are no rules to identify winners or\u000alosers. Mediocrity often masquerades as merit, and we are easily lulled into a\u000afalse sense of complacency about the state of our dance. There seem to be no\u000aclearly defined criteria to determine what constitutes good dance, no\u000ayardsticks to measure excellence and no attempts to condemn poor taste.&nbsp;</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">These\u000aobservations have been made in a constructive spirit after discussing the issues with many concerned artists and art-lovers..</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 7.1pt;">\u000a<div style="text-align: right;">\u000a<span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>V RAMNARAYAN</b></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a</div>\u000a
