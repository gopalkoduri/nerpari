Murthy was&nbsp; honoured with the Laya Madhura Lifetime\u000aaward some months ago. As the veteran mridanga vidwan delivered his speech, we\u000awere astonished at his impeccable memory \u2013 the way he recalled and narrated\u000aepisodes from his childhood and gurukulavasam with Tanjavur Vaidyanatha&nbsp; Iyer. What made a deep impact was the way he\u000aexpressed his gratitude and respect towards his teacher and several others who had\u000ahelped him grow in an artistic career spanning almost nine decades. It is worth\u000aemulating for the present generation. He did not falter or forget any name or\u000aplace in the course of his speech. Equally interesting was the speech by\u000aNarasimhan of Asthika Samajam, Tiruvanmiyur who quoted several anecdotes from\u000athe golden past and spoke about the unique technique of T.K. Murthy.</span></span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></span></span></h2>\u000a<h2 style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Mridanga vidwan Tiruvarur Bakthavatsalam is the founder-director of the Laya Madhura School\u000aof music. As it was the 13<sup>th </sup>anniversary of Laya Madhura, Bhaktavatsalam\u2019s disciples honoured him with a\u000a13-feet long rose garland. It was heartwarming to listen to his senior\u000adisciples Sumesh Narayan and Delhi Sairam express their gratitude to their\u000aguru. Unlike many programmes where the listener is subjected to long winding, boring speeches, the entire evening was a treat for the audience -- many of whom were moved\u000ato tears.</span></span></span></h2>\u000a</div>\u000a
