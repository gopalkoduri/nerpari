Raghavan, Senior Advocate, was a curious old man. In the corridors of the Madras High Court, he was spoken of as the country\u2019s fiercest and most knowledgeable company lawyer. Bustling from one court to another, always followed by two or three harrowed, busy-looking juniors, he never seemed to have the time for small talk. Raghavan was also on the Experts Committee of the Music Academy. As he often reminded people, he was the first Senior Advocate to be on it since the great Justice T.L. Venkatarama Aiyar. He was nominally Mani\u2019s student \u2013 they had only three or four face-to-face music classes ever. Only four years apart, Mani and he were more like old friends. Often, it was rumoured, Mani landed up at Raghavan\u2019s house for breakfast and coffee after his all-night jaunts.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aPresently, Ajith sipped Mrs. Raghavan\u2019s hot coffee, as Raghavan declared, \u201cMani is not a nice man. He looks like a helpless, old, forgotten musician, doesn\u2019t he? All tosh!\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aNot knowing how to respond, Ajith stared intently into his coffee. Raghavan continued, \u201cI have tolerated him for years, because he is a great musician. But I think it is time to call a spade a spade. The next time you speak to him, ask him about his student, Trichy K. Rangarajan. He was the best student Mani ever had. He came from Trichy with nothing but a letter of recommendation from a musician there, and started living in Mani\u2019s house. Mani taught him nothing. He spent all his time washing clothes and vessels, sweeping and swabbing the floor, cooking, paying bills. It was disgusting. He went with Mani to every concert and picked up music just by listening. Mani treated him like an insignificant spider. Mani\u2019s friends, his accompanists, knew that Rangarajan sang very well. They gave him small concerts here and there. And somehow, out of the blue, he got called to sing at the Academy.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cSrividya, Mani\u2019s wife, was highly upset because Mani\u2019s son, Narayanan, had applied but didn\u2019t make it. She fought with Mani for days until Mani intervened and asked Rangarajan to write to the Academy declining the concert. Rangarajan obliged. Then, Mani lobbied for his son who sang in that very same slot. It was disgusting.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cA few months later, Rangarajan took his life. They never talk about him in that house. I\u2019m sure if you ask Mani, he\u2019ll deny the boy\u2019s existence. It is very easy to erase a seventeen-year-old from the world, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith asked, \u201cBut Narayanan is a good musician, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cNarayanan is a top-class musician. But his aesthetics were completely different from his father\u2019s. Sadly, the only people who came to his concerts were his father\u2019s fans who wanted to hear \u2018young Mani\u2019, which Narayanan wasn\u2019t. He faded away from the concert scene silently.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cMani didn\u2019t do anything about it?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI think Mani was tremendously upset by the Rangarajan episode. He didn\u2019t lift his little finger for Narayanan after that. Narayanan fled to a foreign university. He teaches there now. People should know, young man, that their hero is actually a villain.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"> </span><br />\u000a<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">* * *</span></div><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aOn a rickety bus to Kodaikanal, trundling along a highway in disrepair, Ajith called his father. They hadn\u2019t spoken in almost a year.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cAjith?\u201d his father asked, immediately.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cDad,\u201d Ajith said, in a tone that suggested he wanted to stay away from small talk, \u201cwhere in Kodaikanal is that house Thatha owned?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhy?\u201d his father asked.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cPlease answer my question.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHis father paused, considered his response, and then said, \u201cYour Thatha sold it. I\u2019m not sure if it exists anymore.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cAddress?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHis father hesitated, and then said, \u201cListen. Your Paati called me the other day and told me that you were meeting NV Mani about your grand-aunt.\u201d Ajith was surprised. Sharada had not been on talking terms with her son for as long as Ajith remembered. \u201cShe wanted to know if I told you about them.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWell, you did,\u201d Ajith said, bluntly.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI might have. But that doesn\u2019t mean you go looking for these stories. It has split three generations of our family already. Leave it alone now.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Ajith asked.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t your Paati talk to me?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cBecause you left me.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith\u2019s father sighed, and said, \u201cNo. I had stopped talking to them even before you were born. I didn\u2019t leave you, Ajith. I left your mother and my parents. You just happened to be with them, that\u2019s all.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith was silent. His father continued, after a few moments, \u201cYour Thatha gave away that house to your Taapi a year before you were born. For nothing. And she gave it away to Mani. Again, for nothing. And your grandparents did not say a thing. They said it was her property, and that she could do whatever she wanted with it.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cAnd you left my mother because?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThey were all together. In their love for your Taapi and Mani.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI never thought you were such a prude.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith\u2019s father went completely silent; the words stung. They lingered for as long as father and son held their phones. His father finally cut the call. Ajith stared out of the window as a dark, indiscernible landscape spiralled around him on the climb up the mountains. He couldn\u2019t sleep. Thoughts formed whirlpools in his head\u2014swirling, chaotic and deadly. He drifted occasionally into snatches of sleep, only to be awakened by the rumbling of the bus or of his own mind. Ajith woke up in the morning, from that half-sleep, to the cry of touts and autorickshaw drivers at the Kodaikanal bus stand. His phone had two messages from his father. One gave him the address of the house, and the other said, <i>\u201cMy father loved her. Everyone knew.\u201d</i></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThe weight of that revelation fell surprisingly lightly on Ajith\u2019s shoulders. Too many lofts in too many houses with too many secrets had been emptied out on to the floor too quickly.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith barely remembered how he made his way to that address. He didn\u2019t register how much the auto driver asked him for, he was only vaguely relieved that the driver immediately knew the place. He noticed that the house was slightly away from the bustle of the touristy quarter of Kodaikanal. Inhabitation became more sparse as they made their way through an untarred, climbing road towards the top of a densely forested hill.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cShortcut!\u201d the driver announced. Ajith nodded distractedly. \u201cYou\u2019re working at the observatory?\u201d the driver asked again. Ajith muttered, \u201cNo.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cA writer, then!\u201d the driver said.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYes,\u201d Ajith said, not wanting to engage in any conversation.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aWhen they reached the house, Ajith found that it had been converted into a guesthouse of sorts. A home-stay, they called it. A caretaker emerged from behind the house with a pair of gardening shears in his hands.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYes?\u201d he asked Ajith, scanning him through his glasses. His gaze reminded Ajith of Shankar.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith didn\u2019t really know what to do at this point. He needed to see the house, but he had no idea what else to do there. He said, \u201cThis is a guesthouse?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYes.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI need to stay here.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aIf the caretaker was surprised, he didn\u2019t show it. \u201cHow many days, Sir?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith made up his mind as he went along, \u201cTwo days.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThe caretaker now stopped hiding his surprise, \u201cSir, what do you do?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI\u2019m a writer,\u201d Ajith said, almost naturally.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cOk,\u201d the caretaker said, \u201cThis way. I\u2019m Thanjan, owner.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHello,\u201d Ajith said, swinging his backpack over his shoulder, as he walked along the pathway to the door. Thanjan\u2019s gait was slightly off-balance, with each step, it seemed he would fall over to the left. He wore a faded khadi kurta and track pants, and hadn\u2019t shaved in four days.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAs he walked towards the makeshift reception, Ajith had this disconcerting sensation that something was wrong, somewhere. He had seen this house in those photographs, and he vaguely remembered the place from his childhood, but something disturbed him. The place was largely familiar, but not entirely. There was a newness that troubled Ajith; since the owner had kept it so similar to the way it used to be, the small changes stood out. It was almost what he remembered, but it wasn\u2019t. That unsettled him.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAs Ajith filled the details in the caretaker\u2019s register, tweaking small details here and there, changing one digit of his telephone number, or changing the old and new number for his house out of sheer habit, Thanjan asked, \u201cOnly two days, Mr. Ramachandran?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYeah.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThe reason I\u2019m asking you, is because we\u2019ve had writers before, and they\u2019ve all spent months here, writing.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not writing,\u201d Ajith said, \u201cMerely looking for inspiration.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cFor a novel, Sir?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThanjan picked up Ajith\u2019s bag, and led him along a corridor. \u201cUntil last month, there was this girl staying in this room,\u201d the caretaker said, joyfully pointing Ajith to a bright room with a sit-out. Ajith remembered it as the sit-out where his Taapi sat with a cup of tea in a photograph. \u201cThis writer, Sir,\u201d the caretaker continued, \u201cSharanya Ramkumar, her pseudonym is Mythili Iyer.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cAh,\u201d Ajith said, \u201cI know her. Very autobiographical novel...\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYeah? A sad life, then! She wrote the whole thing here, in this room,\u201d he said, almost wistfully, then, suddenly, springing to life, \u201cShall I get you some chai?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThat would be great.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYou don\u2019t mind a light tea? Flavoured?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cSounds great.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI\u2019ll get you the tea. You have to guess the flavour. You will not get this anywhere else in South India. I grow the flavouring in the garden!\u201d Thanjan left Ajith to himself and scurried away to the kitchen.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith spotted a black tambura in a corner of the room, in a pretty wooden stand, nestled amongst floor-pillows. He recognised it immediately as the one in the photograph.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHe fished out his toothbrush from his bag, and found he didn\u2019t have toothpaste. Thanjan came back, almost on cue, and said, \u201cI thought you might not have toothpaste!\u201d and handed him a Dabur Red. The paste tasted as foul as it looked, and Ajith washed his mouth until he could taste his teeth again.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aWhen he finished, he found Thanjan waiting for him in the sit-out, laying out the tea. There were two cups. Thanjan had invited himself.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThe sit-out was sunshiny; it opened out to the view of a rivulet twisting around moss-ridden grey rocks amidst a thicket. There were two cane chairs\u2014Ajith recognised them from the photographs again</span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">\u2014</span>and a plastic teapoy that looked woefully out of place.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI suggest you have it with honey. No milk, no sugar,\u201d Thanjan said.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith obeyed, as he was hardly given any option. He brought the hot cup towards his mouth, and smelt something fruity. He sipped the tea and found that the flavour was a mix of two or three fruits. Pineapple, definitely. A dash of mango, perhaps. And a little lemon.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWrong,\u201d Thanjan declared, \u201cIt\u2019s only one fruit.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith was surprised. He took another sip, the taste began to grow on him now, and it achieved some coherence, Instead of tasting like a mixture of three flavours, it tasted like one. But he couldn\u2019t put his finger on what it was.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cPassion fruit!\u201d Thanjan said, \u201cThe previous owner of this house was a bit of a gardener also.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThis made Ajith curious, \u201cWho was he?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThere was a she, who was the gardener, and then there was a he, who sold it to my father,\u201d Thanjan said, \u201cBiscuit?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cMani sold it to your father?\u201d Ajith asked, ignoring the biscuit.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThanjan put the biscuit back on the tray, \u201cHow do you know Mani Sir owned this house?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI\u2019ve been interviewing him.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThanjan didn\u2019t believe him, \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have told you this.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhy?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that. Anyway,\u201d he said, emptying the contents of the teacup into his mouth in one large gulp, \u201cI must be going now. You can leave the cups here.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThanjan stood up to leave, when Ajith said, \u201cI am Ramachandran\u2019s grandson. I\u2019ve been to this house before.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThanjan sat down, \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me you are going to write this story?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhy is everyone so ashamed of it?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cMani Sir is a respected classical musician.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cMany respected classical musicians have had open dalliances.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cBut at his age, you want all this to come out? And,\u201d he said suddenly, \u201cSaras Akka is your own family!\u201d Then he declared with an air of finality, \u201cIf you came here looking for a story, you\u2019re not getting one.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThanjan stormed out, and walked back in to say, \u201cDo you want hot water for a bath? I\u2019ll have to heat it on the stove.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith nodded.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith bathed lazily. The hot water from Thanjan\u2019s stove was exhausted too quickly, but his body got used to the sting of the cold tap water after a few tentative mugs. How quickly we get used to things, Ajith thought. What seems indigestible, intolerable, painful, soon becomes a part of our everyday. This isn\u2019t about making friends with discomfort, he thought, it is about redefining it for yourself.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHe felt a lot better after that bath. The happy smell of soap and shampoo lifted his spirits. He went back to the sit-out, spread his legs out on to the teapoy and picked up the newspaper. He tucked into the sports page when Thanjan came back and said, \u201cBreakfast is ready.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith took his newspaper with him to the dining table, where he ate in silence. Thanjan coldly served him hot idlis, fresh from the cooker, with steaming sambar and slightly salty chutney. They didn\u2019t say a word to each other. Another cup of passion fruit tea later, Ajith went back to the sit-out and sat down with his laptop. Now that he had two days to himself, he thought it might be a good idea to sit and transcribe the interview.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aWith his legs on the teapoy, laptop on his lap, recorder in his shirt pocket and earphones in his ear, Ajith started transcribing. He started with the first part of the conversation, Mani\u2019s memories of his childhood and his early teachers. He spoke of his mother, of how he kept talam with the clatter of her sewing machine. \u201cShe had rhythm in everything she did,\u201d Mani said, \u201cYou could play the mridangam to her walk, to her talk, to her cutting vegetables, cooking, churning the cream into butter.\u201d And his father, who could imitate the great nagaswaram vidwans, the distinct violin styles of Chowdiah, Dwaram and Papa, Dhanammal\u2019s veena, all with his voice, and <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_28.html" target="_blank">Mali</a> with his whistling. He wrote about Mani\u2019s brief schooling in a convent, where Mani claimed to anger his English teacher by asking him how Jesus could carry a goat in his arms and walk around when his followers ate the goat with relish. Then came his memories of the drama company, practising long and hard to get every entry, exit, every dance sequence, every song perfect, travelling by bullock cart to different villages for performances, singing and acting about eight hours a day without a trace of tiredness or boredom, tasting alcohol for the first time at fifteen after a particularly successful show, and learning <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja</a> kritis from unnamed \u2018mamas\u2019.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith remembered Mani\u2019s wonderment and joy while recollecting these memories. He really didn\u2019t want them lost with his passing. And he was happy he found a patient listener, who would also write about them.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aBy lunch, Ajith reached the part about Janani, but he had already exceeded his word limit. He had two-and-a-half days\u2019 worth of conversation still left to go through on his recorder. He decided to transcribe everything, and then begin the editing process.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThanjan announced lunch as sourly as he had announced breakfast. Ajith ate the lunch at the common dining table as sourly as he had eaten the breakfast, which was a pity, for the food was excellent. There was another man at the table for lunch, but Ajith buried himself in a novel, not wanting to make any conversation.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAfter lunch, Ajith resumed his writing in the sit-out, but found it a lot harder to concentrate. The food had settled heavily in his tummy, and kept sending him into snatches of sleep.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThe rivulet gurgled outside; the water sparkled in the sunlight that fell from directly above it. He saw a rabbit by the trees, hopping about aimlessly. His phone rang, and a woman\u2019s voice he had definitely heard before said, \u201cFollow the rabbit.\u201d The voice was familiar, but Ajith couldn\u2019t exactly place it. Something told him, though, that he should follow the rabbit. Soon, the rabbit had led him to a part of the forest where Thanjan and Mani sat discussing something in hushed tones. When they saw Ajith, they bolted, and Ajith ran after them. Soon, Ajith found he wasn\u2019t chasing Thanjan or Mani, but his father and grandfather. Saraswathi overtook him, caught up with them, and ran past them. Ajith ran faster, overtaking all of them, and nearly reaching the finish line, when he found the rabbit and a tortoise had reached before him, and were bickering about some cheating.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith woke up when his laptop fell to the ground with a thud. He was disoriented and worried for a second, but he calmed down when he found that there was no damage done. He saved the file, and put his computer on sleep mode and took a proper nap on the bed.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHe woke up nearly three hours later, with a faint sense of a tense, nagging dream. He didn\u2019t remember it, though. He could do with another cup of that passion fruit tea. He found Thanjan in the garden again, with his shears and a hosepipe, tending to a tree that Ajith had never seen before.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhat tree is this?\u201d Ajith asked.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThanjan, his voice still unfriendly, replied, \u201cTea tree. You let the plant grow, and it turns into this.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThanjan didn\u2019t seem to be doing anything with his shears or the hosepipe. He was just walking around the garden with them for company. Once he reached the main gate with Ajith following him, Thanjan asked, \u201cDo you want tea?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith was now at the desk in his room, his laptop on the table, a cup of tea by its side, attempting to restart his transcribing. After much thought, he decided to skip the portion about Janani for now, and moved on to the second day of the interview. Here, Ajith found, very little of the conversation was recorded. Most of it happened in the room when Mani\u2019s brother was picking out furniture, or in the car on the way to the beach. Ajith dropped the conversation format, and wrote in a more freestyle prose way for this part of the interview.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aIt was almost eight before he finished writing this part and editing the entire interview until then, when Thanjan came again for dinner. Ajith said, \u201cWant to read what I\u2019m writing?\u201d Unsurely, Thanjan said, \u201cYes.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aJust then, Ajith\u2019s phone rang. It was Nethra.&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHello!\u201d he said.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhere the hell are you?\u201d she asked, urgently.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cKodaikanal.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith heard her take a deep breath, before she said, \u201cMani\u2019s very breathless. May not last till morning.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"> </span><br />\u000a<div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>(<a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/08/sruti-fiction_8.html" target="_blank">To be continued</a>)</b></span></div><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aDisclaimer: This is a work of fiction, with fictional characters.
