Mani</span></b></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></b> </span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-msG1T2aUNgU/UJIJNxA9wQI/AAAAAAAACJ0/mECjj2JlauE/s1600/1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="309" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-msG1T2aUNgU/UJIJNxA9wQI/AAAAAAAACJ0/mECjj2JlauE/s320/1.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Music therapy using Carnatic music is gaining momentum and no one should really be cynical about it. After all, Carnatic music is all about creativity\u2014<i>manodharma sangeetam.</i> That it has developed into a new branch of medicine is a matter to be proud of. It is widely believed that listening to Carnatic music helps ease tension and to feel more relaxed. But not for all, or so it appears from my interaction with the following (imaginary) characters.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I met this busy performer at his residence while he was preparing to go to a concert. I greeted him with a \u201cNamaskaram\u201d.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cNamaskaram. What is the matter?\u201d he asked without looking at me as he fiddled with his tambura.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cI want your opinion \u2026\u201d, I said. He did not let me continue. He replied in an irritated voice, \u201cWhat opinion? This is not the time for it. I have a concert in thirty minutes. I have to go.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />When I persisted, he looked at me and said apologetically, \u201cOh! Oh! I did not realise that it was you. I am sorry. You come with me to the sabha. We can talk in the car.\u201d He struggled with the tambura strings and gave up after a while.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />He screamed at his wife, \u201cIs my warm water flask ready?\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />She murmured something in disapproval and soon appeared with a bag containing two flasks. He almost grabbed the bag and shoved it in the car along with the tambura.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I sat next to the driver. Within a few minutes, I felt the aroma of Kumbakonam \u2018degree\u2019 coffee filling the car. I turned and looked at him enquiringly. He offered me a small cup saying \u201cI had no time in the morning\u201d and started enjoying his coffee.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cSir, what do you feel \u2026.\u201d I started. He cut me short and said, \u201cYou see, I sang in the last slot concert yesterday and have the first concert this morning. Could not catch even a few hours of sleep. No akara sadhakam today.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I nodded my head and continued \u201cSir\u2026\u201d \u201cLook at the traffic,\u201d he said, \u201cI have to be there in 15 minutes.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The driver assured him that he would reach the venue in time, but it failed to calm the musician. He diverted his attention to the tambura strings for a while. He looked out again and found that we had hardly moved. Feeling increasingly nervous, he hit the back of the driver\u2019s seat with his fist. He then took out his cellphone and spoke into it in an extremely polite way. He kept thanking and praising the person at the other end. \u201cThat was the sponsor of today\u2019s kutcheri,\u201d he explained.</span></div>\u000a<br />\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cSir\u2026\u201d I ventured once again. He did not listen to me. He took out a small diary, flipped through the pages, and muttered under his breath that he would sing \u2018Set no. 5\u2019. He then explained to me what that meant. \u201cI have about five or six sets of kriti-s listed here. I sing them one after another. So long as I don\u2019t sing the same kriti in two consecutive concerts, it is fine. Beyond that no one remembers.\u201d He looked out again and shook his head.</span></div>\u000a<br />\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B2gN_YXQ_QY/UJIJWSE4DuI/AAAAAAAACJ8/QEz7z_N6LkY/s1600/2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="296" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B2gN_YXQ_QY/UJIJWSE4DuI/AAAAAAAACJ8/QEz7z_N6LkY/s320/2.jpg" width="320" /></a><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cSir, I want to ask you...\u201d I tried once more. He did not respond. Instead, he took out the newspaper and quickly turned to the Music Review column. \u201cUseless people! They think much too highly of themselves,\u201d he touched the tara sthayi. His face turned red and he crushed the paper in his hand. \u201cFellows who cannot differentiate between prati madhyamam and suddha madhyamam start writing reviews,\u201d he said. I understood that he was upset about a review of his performance. He read out a line. \u201cHis Latangi alapana was like shades of Kalyani and Pantuvarali mixed together.\u201d \u201cWhat shades was she thinking about, I wonder. She should be writing about \u2018pattu\u2019 saree shades rather than the shades of raga-s!\u201d He seemed to be enjoying his wit at the expense of the reviewer and guffawed. \u201c<a href="http://www.sruti.com/" target="_blank">Sruti magazine</a> serves these fellows right,\u201d he continued with a laugh which was interrupted by the ringtone of the cellphone.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cNo, no. Don\u2019t worry. I will be there in time. I am almost at the sabha, just a few metres away. No no, don\u2019t do that. No need to cancel the kutcheri.\u201d He switched off the cellphone and suggested some shortcuts, which the driver, however, refused to follow.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018That was the sabha secretary. He wants to cancel the programme because I may be late. Do you understand my problems? I am always tense. I have to please the sponsor, the sabha fellows, the critics and so on.\u201d He did not include the rasika-s in his list.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />We reached the sabha and barely had we stepped out of the car than the Secretary, in a sweat, came rushing out and escorted the musician to the stage. The question I had wanted to ask the musician was: \u201cIf listening to music can be a great stress buster, what is it like for you, singing day in and day out?\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The concert started and the secretary came out wiping his forehead saying, \u201cMy God! That was close. I don\u2019t understand why they can\u2019t leave home early and reach 15 minutes before the start of the programme.\u201d I wanted to ask him if he was \u2018stress free\u2019 since he was listening to almost 12 hours of non-stop music. So I began, \u201cSir\u2026\u201d He waved at someone and ordered a hot cup of coffee. \u201cI need it, badly\u201d he muttered to himself and stepped into his office. I followed him. The telephone rang and he confirmed some programme to the caller. The coffee arrived. He took a sip and shouted, \u201cHey, you know I am a diabetic. I always take coffee without sugar. Go, return this and bring another one.\u201d Just then somebody entered and said, \u201cSir there is not enough phenyl to wash the toilets.\u201d The secretary stared at him and without saying a word handed him a hundred rupee note. The phone rang again. As he was talking, he looked out of the window and found that someone had parked a car in the parking lot reserved for him. He hung up the receiver and called for the watchman and yelled at him. \u2018How many times have I told you not to allow anyone to park the car in my slot!\u201d The poor watchman fumbled for words and did not say anything. \u201cMy driver will bring my lunch from home. Take it and ask him to park the car outside somewhere.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cCome let us go and listen at least to one kriti,\u201d he said grabbing my hand. Before we could move, an electrician came there complaining that the air conditioners had stopped working. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d he shouted. Then calming down he instructed, \u201cPlease go and repair it immediately before the audience realise it.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The secretary\u2019s cellphone started ringing. He replied curtly, \u201cYes, Okay. I will take it.\u201d He told me that was his wife, reminding him to take his blood pressure tablet.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />An old man walked up to him and complained that the speakers were too loud. I saw the blood rushing to his face, but he controlled himself and promised to attend to it. He then turned to me and said, \u201cDid you hear that? Musicians want it to be high! Whom am I to satisfy? Let me go and attend to the problems. At this rate, I get to listen only to <i>Pavamana</i> every day!\u201d There was no need to ask him the question that I had wanted to all this while.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Inside the auditorium, I found that the man sitting next to me was a music critic. He was covering the programme for a leading newspaper. Gradually he became friendly and talked a lot. A new concert began.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />As soon as the first song started, he looked into the Music Index Book and scribbled something in his small notebook. \u201cYou know, I have to be very careful,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise <i>Sruti</i> will list all the mistakes in my review. They have some jobless people doing only this. [Touché, Mr. Mani \u2013 <b>Editor</b>]. What if I write <i>kodi janmamu</i> or <i>koti janmamu?</i>\u201d I clarified that \u2018kodi\u2019 in Telugu means \u2018chicken\u2019 and \u2018koti\u2019 means \u2018crore\u2019. He smiled at me approvingly. He kept looking at his watch and looked restless. \u201cAny problem?\u201d I enquired. \u201cI have a very tight schedule,\u201d said he. I have to cover two more concerts. Not only that. I have to send the reviews in time for the evening edition of the newspaper. It is really a tough life. May I ask you a favour?\u201d I nodded my head. \u201cWill you call me at the end of this concert and give me the list of songs? I have written the review already. I will fill in the blanks once I receive your call. I must send them for the evening edition. Please help me.\u201d He hurriedly gave me his visiting card and left. If this job was stressful, surely he won\u2019t go in for Music Therapy!</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-w516jvTw8W4/UJIJhnK8YkI/AAAAAAAACKE/1NJ0MJNixK0/s1600/3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-w516jvTw8W4/UJIJhnK8YkI/AAAAAAAACKE/1NJ0MJNixK0/s320/3.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I was confident I would find at least one rasika who acknowledged that he had come to the concert to relieve his daily stress. I closed my eyes and was engrossed in the Kambhoji alapana. Soon, I had a new neighbour. After some initial hesitation, we started talking in whispers.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cDo you attend many kutcheri-s in the season?\u201d I asked.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cYes, wherever the admission is free,\u201d came the reply.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cDo you enjoy listening to this music?\u201d I explored.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cThis music is definitely less noisy, though the artists do their best to make it otherwise. To answer your question, yes, I like it.\u201d He continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about Carnatic music. I do not break my head over identifying the raga or knowing the kriti. This is a good opportunity for me to escape from the clutches of my wife. If I stay at home, she would send me out on an errand or keep nagging me about some of my relatives. After sitting for a couple of hours, I go to the canteen and eat whatever I like. At home I am not permitted to eat sweets and fried items.\u201d He looked at his watch, jumped up and said, \u201cOh! It is nearly 4 pm. It\u2019s time for hot badam halwa.\u201d He went out happily humming a film song.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />At last, I had found a person whom Carnatic music was helping to avoid stress!</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><u><i>Tailpiece</i></u></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The following is an incident that happened in the Mylapore Fine Arts Club during the \u2018season\u2019 2006 concert of Sudha Ragunathan. Sudha was in the middle of the Reetigaula alapana. Someone fainted in the hall and she stopped until the patient was helped out.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Did Sudha administer an overdose of Reetigaula? Should Reetigaula be excluded from our medicine list? Was the man allergic to Reetigaula?</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Over to music therapists!</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
