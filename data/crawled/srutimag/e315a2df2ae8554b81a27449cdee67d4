The dance scenario too drew favourable comments all round. There are a few exceptions to this popular view, with some senior citizens, especially among critics, holding the view that the present day practitioners of both these arts are not a patch on the stalwarts of the past. In balance, the general run of reviews from both <i>Sruti</i> staffers and others, indicates that the recent season offered good performances overall, but none of them seems to haves potted any major new talent.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAmong the artists themselves, opinions vary as to the state of Carnatic music today. Veteran flautist N. Ramani struck a despondent note when he said, \u2018Those were the days when the rasika-s were really serious about attending season concerts and it was not just a fad. The concert duration was longer. People stayed. On the contrary today durations have become shorter and the rasika-s too do a lot of sabha hopping in the same evening. I miss the serious rasika.\u2019</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vTwjqfHuKd0/TtB4yPqNpGI/AAAAAAAAAEk/s3GXgDlEze4/s1600/P+Unnikrishnan.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vTwjqfHuKd0/TtB4yPqNpGI/AAAAAAAAAEk/s3GXgDlEze4/s1600/P+Unnikrishnan.jpg" /></a></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">Young vocalist P. Unnikrishnan had a different view to offer. He told <i>The Hindu\u2019s</i> correspondent: \u201cThe audience is more demanding now. You can\u2019t \u2018manage\u2019 without competence. They won\u2019t accept it. I think this kind of audience inspires us through the year to do well, give of our best. Season concerts become benchmarks for us to live up to, until the next season comes round, when hopefully, we will set higher goals.\u201d</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the same feature, \u2018My festival\u2019 in <i>The Hindu,</i> the sisters Ranjani and Gayatri lamented the lack of opportunities to listen to senior vidwans brought about by the ever-increasing workload they and other performers shoulder during the season. \u201cToday, not only the top artists but also youngsters give 8 to 10 performances,\u201d they complained, \u201care they equipped to do justice to their art? Besides, how can they listen to others if they are constantly performing? And if they don\u2019t make use of the season to listen to seniors, how are they going to improve their own music?\u201d</div></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-npZ0yxsBoGw/TtB5uXr3TeI/AAAAAAAAAEs/ZQVqbxcMYSA/s1600/Vedavalli.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"></a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Veterans R. Vedavalli, R.K. Srikantan and Nedunuri Krishnamurthy gave standout performances, steeped in tradition but lacking in none of the elements of a polished, accomplished, contemporary kutcheri. According to one of our correspondents, they proved that \u201cvidwat gained with age and experience can deliver great music with the right mix of composure and technical virtuosity\u201d.</div></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k6BKSvr87xU/TtB8b7qd2BI/AAAAAAAAAE0/4gO-1E1FIqo/s1600/Sanjay.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k6BKSvr87xU/TtB8b7qd2BI/AAAAAAAAAE0/4gO-1E1FIqo/s1600/Sanjay.jpg" /></a></div>The stars of today did not disappoint, with the likes of T.M. Krishna, Sanjay Subrahmanyan, Vijay Siva, Bombay Jayashri, and Ranjani-Gayatri rising to the occasion repeatedly despite the stupendous demands on their stamina and endurance.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe major gain from the music season was the display of an abundance of talent among violinists and percussionists. This trend would surely support the views of the optimists who see a rosy future for Carnatic music.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aBut junior musicians, including many talented youngsters, almost always performed before poorly filled auditoriums. Many vocalists created a good impression with their pleasant voices, good pathantara and intelligent presentation, but missing in most of them was depth of bhava, according to critics. Where are the new Sanjays and Vijay Sivas, Jayashris and Nithyasrees, asked many rasika-s who recall having to stand outside overflowing halls to listen to these present day stalwarts in their debut seasons a decade or so ago?</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a\u2018Tamil\u2019 music received a fillip this season too, with Kartik Fine Arts hosting the Tamil Isai Festival in Anna Nagar, in addition to the customary celebration at Raja Annamalai Hall.<br />\u000a<br />\u000aBy and large, there seems to be an increased awareness of the aesthetics of stage decor all around, to go by some of the reports we received, though a few of the major venues including the Music Academy showed an unwelcome departure from good taste, with their loud, even gaudy decors. Acoustics again was an area of improvement this season in some of the main venues, though here too we are a long way from approaching the ideal.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a\u201cThe rustle of the day\u2019s <i>Kutcheribuzz</i> newssheet and the cell phone buzz from all sides were extremely disturbing to the serious listener,\u201d says one of our correspondents. \u201cApart from those speaking into their cell phones, there were quite a number of youngsters continuously tapping away sms\u2019s, the clicking sound irritating. Are they even aware of such a thing as concert etiquette?\u201d she asks indignantly.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aDid we really witness a distinct change in audience habits or was it a momentary aberration? The customary exodus during tani avartanam seemed to be reduced to a smaller number of coffee lovers making a beeline for the canteen at many venues. Perhaps <i>Sruti\u2019s</i> ceaseless campaign against this practice has begun to yield results! (This view is contested by at least one of our contributors who maintains people continue to stage walkouts.)</div></div>
