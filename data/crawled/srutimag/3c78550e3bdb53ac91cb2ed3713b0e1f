The Indian government named him a national treasure. For long one of two artists every westerner identified Indian classical music with, Ali Akbar Khan was among the most decorated of Indian musicians.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aA student of his martinet father Baba Allauddin Khan along with Ravi Shankar, Nikhil Banerjee, Pannalal Ghosh and other outstanding disciples, at his ashram in East Bengal, and at Maihar, Madhya Pradesh, Ustad Ali Akbar Khan mastered the sarod to reach great heights, though he started learning Hindustani music\u2014at the age of three\u2014with vocal music, and went on to experiment with the surbahar, tabla and sitar.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aWaking at the crack of dawn and going on for some 18 hours of practice was the students\u2019 daily routine at Maihar. In Ali Akbar Khan as well as his classmates, the regimen was to produce unparalleled rigour and discipline, and complete realisation of every raga taught. On him, his father\u2019s teaching made such a profound impact that he continued to say till the very end of his life: \u201cI can hear Baba\u2019s instruction while playing. He makes me play. I do my riyaz on stage.\u201d For he remained an eternal student, forever practising and polishing his art, even as his own school, the Ali Akbar College of Music in California, produced at least two generations of fine Hindustani classical musicians.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAli Akbar Khan first went to the USA in 1955, courtesy Yehudi Menuhin, and was instrumental, along with his friend and partner Pandit Ravi Shankar, in introducing western audiences to Indian classical music. Though the brothers-in-law\u2014Ravi Shankar married Ali Akbar\u2019s sister Annapoorna Devi\u2014did not hesitate to collaborate with jazz and rock musicians to make their own art palatable to the untrained western ear, his was an austere, uncompromising music, not a flashy compromise in standards. His \u2018Music of India: Morning and Evening Ragas\u2019 was perhaps the first LP of Indian classical music in the United States.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aTo the end, Ali Akbar Khan remained a simple, loving man, who cared more for music and his students than his numerous honours and awards, of which the Padma Vibhushan was the highest. To connoisseurs of Hindustani music, he has been the greatest sarod artist of all time.</div></div>
