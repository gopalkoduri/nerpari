V<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">\u000a<h1 style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small;">By Bala Shankar</span></h1>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;">They come in all forms, shapes and characters.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;"> </span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;">They are the backbone to this unique\u000acultural extravaganza.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;"> </span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;">They are the\u000amain sponsors, morally speaking.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;"> </span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;">The\u000athousands of rasikas of the December festival in Chennai have never been titled\u000afor their unstinting support.</span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;"> </span><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; text-align: left;">To me\u000athey offer a fascinating kaleidoscope for a lighthearted chat.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Let us begin with the haves and the have-nots. The festival draws people from all economic\u000alayers. You have the have-nots who are\u000athe main sponsors of auto-terrorism. The auto rickshaw industry finds its best preys in this part of the\u000ayear. Traffic after 8 PM flows in all\u000adirections. As the wallets wane in thickness, these have-not rasikas are not\u000adeterred from their appointment with music. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The haves, on the other hand, are more conspicuous \u2013 not\u000ajust in the latest BMWs that they arrive in, but in every other way. They probably even plan their arrivals (to\u000abe noticed in their new Nalli or Kumaran saree or some striking jewellery),\u000athey carry a sense of \u2018ownership right\u2019 at the Sabhas, and do not flinch at any\u000aopportunity to be seen or heard (talking, that is!). For many, this is the equivalent of the Cannes film festival.&nbsp; Many of them hold ancestral rights to their\u000aseats and have to thank their forefathers for the good old partnership between\u000amusicians and rich patrons. Knowledge\u000aof music has never been an important criterion for their presence in concerts.\u000aThe annual social calling is something they are not going to miss.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">As with most things in life, there is an 80:20 rule\u000ahere. Curiously, the 20 % are the more\u000aknowledgeable! The rest are either beginners or to put it a little cruelly,\u000a\u2018lay persons\u2019. The fortunate former group consists of part-time musicians,\u000astudents, \u2018mamis\u2019 with good \u2018gnanam\u2019 (some of whom, but for unfair in-laws,\u000awould have made it big), chroniclers who attend a blizzard of concerts, very\u000aoften of their favourite musicians, and can rattle off a lot of trivia \u2013 the\u000aRTP of a particular concert, or the names of the accompanists for a Mylapore\u000aFine Arts concert nine or ten years ago, for example. There are also the high \u2018intensity\u2019 ones, who would rather prefer\u000ato hear an XYZpriya or a PQRgowlai to a Kambhoji or Todi in the\u000aRTP \u2013 their mission is to gauge the technical skills of musicians! Some of them are also \u2018invisible\u2019\u000ajudges&nbsp; \u2013 the rasika world often\u000aconsults them. Talam strikers form another group, me included sometimes, even if\u000awe are daunted by complex \u2018nadais\u2019 in the Pallavi.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Then there are people whom I call the co-singers,\u000awho can\u2019t resist the temptation to start their vocal support from the audience\u000achambers as the performers pick-up a <i>Nagumomu </i>or <i>Chakkani raja</i>.\u000aNarada Gana Sabha\u2019s fine print at the back of tickets warning them to desist\u000afrom this does not catch their attention. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The 80 % crowd, the know-nots, obviously come in\u000awider varieties. Many of them seem to\u000ahave a strong leash originating at the canteen and carry profound knowledge of\u000athe relative canteen merits and specials. What\u2019s amazing is the number of\u000adifferent activities these people can do while they are still part of the\u000aaudience \u2013 reading The Hindu, clearing sleep backlog, conversations on subjects\u000aoutside music, engaging in raga quizzes (they may know only the questions),\u000asms-ing! Some clearly do not want to hide their duress.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">All musicians I am sure still love this 80 % lot, as\u000awithout them, there is no \u2018grandeur\u2019 to the concerts \u2013 the more the\u000amerrier. For their part, the musicians\u000aalso pack some friendly \u2018diet\u2019 in their song list \u2013 <i>Banturiti, Krishna nee\u000abegane baro </i>etc., and the ever growing tukkada course, not to alienate this\u000acrowd. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">It is rare to find kids \u2013 there are only two kinds \u2013\u000atiny tots below five, who have none to keep them company, and the young teenage\u000astudents \u2013 who are prodded every few minutes to identify ragams, and to \u2018put\u2019\u000atalam, amidst their more germane interest in finishing the Harry Potter 3 or 4\u000aor 5 book or the angry bird game.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">There are also couples and singles \u2013 some of the\u000asingles are ageless ladies and the couples seem determined to stay together\u000athrough joy and grief (you never know which way the concert will go!). I am at\u000aa loss as to how to classify the \u2018movers and shakers\u2019 \u2013 some seem to do the\u000amore natural \u2018appreciative\u2019 nod, but some others have a \u2018rap-like\u2019 urge to\u000agyrate.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">\u2018Part-time audience\u2019 is a funny term by itself \u2013 not\u000aif you consider the strayers into Srinivasa Sastry Hall from other errands\u000aaround the busy Luz area! Or those drawn in to halls for the air-conditioning\u000acomfort.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">There are also players outside the ring \u2013 these are\u000apick-up relatives \u2013 including macho young men, possibly on a winter break from\u000aUS colleges, slyly seeking valuable introductions and the NRI listener whose\u000acanteen chatter is sprinkled with California, New Jersey and lately, Singapore\u000atopics.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Wimbledon champions laud the crowd in their\u000aacceptance speech. The rasika community of Chennai is, however, largely unsung\u000a(!). Their passivity is not sufficient reason to neglect them. Even if they are considered not worthy of a\u000atitle, they do deserve being written about.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
