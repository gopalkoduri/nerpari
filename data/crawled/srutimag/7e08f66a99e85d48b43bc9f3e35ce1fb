The\u000aperson at the ticket counter refused to sell tickets as they were sold out even\u000athe previous day. A peep into the hall revealed that there were hardly a\u000ahundred people in the auditorium with a capacity of over a thousand. The second\u000aconcert for the evening was a sellout and the sabha refused to let anybody\u000aattend the first concert. In fact the sabha issues separate tickets for the two\u000aevening slots unlike some other sabhas where one common ticket is issued for\u000aboth the evening concerts.&nbsp;</span></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></span>\u000a\u000a</div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The\u000agroup pleaded that they were the family members of the musician and wanted to\u000abuy the tickets for his concert alone. They requested to be let in and assured\u000athat they would leave as soon as the first concert ended. \u201cThe family has\u000aalready come and has gone in. We cannot allow you\u201d jeered the sabha official.\u000aAt this the leader of the group insisted that they were indeed the family\u000amembers and demanded to be let in. Still the official refused to sell any\u000atickets to them. The group would not budge. Finally he asked one of them to\u000amarch behind him. \u201cOthers stay at the gate and do not follow me,\u201d he warned. He\u000awalked onto the stage where the musicians were already seated on dais and were\u000adoing a sound check behind the curtains. The bewildered musician identified his\u000aown cousin who was brought in like an impostor trying to sneak in. </span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Grudgingly\u000athe official suffered the group to occupy the seats and departed after warning\u000athem once again that they had to leave at the end of the concert. Evidently the\u000afew others in the hall were either members or season ticket holders who had\u000acome to attend both the concerts. </span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Discourtesy\u000aof this kind is an insult to the musician as well as the rasika and has never\u000abeen encountered in any of the hundreds of sabhas in the city. </span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Other\u000asabhas manage such situations either by clearing the hall for each programme or\u000apunching the tickets of the audience already seated during the first programme.</span></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
