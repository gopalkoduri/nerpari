Slowly his mind cleared. He recognized me within ten days. His eyes were still bandaged. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to inform him that he had lost his eyesight. I told the doctor to tell him about it in my absence. When he knew that he had lost his vision forever, Tambi seemed to lose his wits once again. And yet, in the midst of all these tribulations he did not forget the actress! Often he would smile to himself, and repeat her name. I didn\u2019t feet like bringing Vanaja to see him.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Vanaja, however, was impatient to see him. I put her off by saying that the doctor had forbidden all visitors. Finally, unable to withstand her pestering, I took her to the hospital. We had both decided not to inform Tambi of her visit. Accordingly, she came into the sick room and stood in silence. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018It happened as I feared. As he talked to himself Sivakozhundu called out to Manoranjitam by name and babbled endearments to her. I glanced at Vanaja with great anxiety. Ayya! Haven\u2019t the elders said that it is impossible for men to understand the hearts of women? I realized then how true that was. I thought that Vanaja would be disgusted when she saw how Sivakozhundu was still enamoured of Manoranjitam, and lose all her love for him. But what happened was exactly the opposite. Vanaja\u2019s feelings did not waver one bit. If anything, her affections seemed to grow deeper. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018She demanded to be taken to the hospital every day, but without my disclosing her identity to Tambi. She insisted on sending food to him daily, and brought it herself on some days. I didn\u2019t like any of this. True, I had wanted to give Vanaja in marriage to Sivakozhundu earlier. But was it possible now? Would her mother agree? Would this daft boy ever agree to it? After all that had happened, he had still not got over his infatuation for Manoranjitam! So what was the use in encouraging Vanaja\u2019s feelings? </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Even as I ruminated, I was disconcerted by something she wanted to do. \u201cMama! You must agree to my proposal,\u201d was the beginning of a long speech which ended with, \u201cI am going to change my name to Manoranjitam. You must give me your consent.\u201d </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018At first I couldn\u2019t make out head or tail of her request. I understood however when Vanaja said that she was going to take advantage of Tambi\u2019s blindness and turn herself into Manoranjitam. She told me that she could talk, sing and behave like Manoranjitam, and forthwith proceeded to mimic her perfectly. Her voice and speech were carbon copies of what I had seen on the stage. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018I was not at all in favour of cheating Tambi in this manner. I also feared that it might result in something unpleasant. But I could not withstand Vanaja\u2019s obstinacy and tears. \u201cMama! I have nothing in the world but him. Since he doesn\u2019t like Vanaja, I will transform myself into Manoranjitam. You must agree to this. Otherwise I will kill myself and you will be responsible for a woman\u2019s death.\u201d </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018After many days of vacillation, I finally agreed to this deception. I couldn\u2019t bear to see the girl\u2019s misery. Also there was still hope that if the plot succeeded, Sivakozhundu might return to his former self At the same time, I was preyed upon by fear and anxiety, First, the plot had to succeed. But how would Tambi react when the truth came out? I finally decided that there was a God in heaven, and let things take their course. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018The next day I took Vanaja to Tambi\u2019s house. As I wondered how to bring up the topic, by chance Vanaja\u2019s bangles happened to tinkle, catching Tambi by surprise.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018\u2018\u2018Who\u2019s that, Mama?\u201d he asked. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018With some relief, I answered, \u201cTambi, Manoranjitam has come to see you from Madras.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018\u201cWhat! Manoranjitam?\u201d Tambi exclaimed and sat up in bed. For a minute, I was scared.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018But Vanaja came forward at once, and placing her hands on his shoulders she made him lie down again, saying, \u201cYes it is me. You must rest now.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Ayyo! Tambi\u2019s look of that moment still haunts me. He stared and stared with his sightless eyes. Don\u2019t people realize the value of things only when they lose them? Tambi must have realized the value of sight most dearly at that moment. I was pained to see the boundless anguish on his face for those eyes now irrevocably lost. I also felt ashamed for attempting to deceive him. But what was the use of feeling sorry after being persuaded by the girl to comply?</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018I told him the story Vanaja and I had concocted earlier. As if I had learnt it by rote, I said that since he had been calling out to Manoranjitam again and again when he lay unconscious in the hospital, I had written to the woman believing that he would get well only if she came to see him. That had brought her here.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Vanaja reiterated that she had come running when she saw the letter and that she would return only after he got well.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018After some more talk of this kind I said, \u201cArnma! Sing something for Tambi.\u201d We had planned this too in advance.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018One of the roles played by Manoranjitam was that of Nandan. As Nandan, she would sing the arutpa \u201cPadamudiyaadini tuyaram\u201d as a ragamalika. Vanaja now sang the same song in the same manner. I was astounded by her exact imitation of the actress\u2019s voice, and style of singing, and her precise reproduction of her embellishments of the melody. Tambi listened in a state of bliss. The tears flowed from his eyes.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018We were both extremely happy that our plot had succeeded so well. Vanaja started to visit Tambi, often spending the whole day with him. Tambi had no close relatives. There was no one in the house except for the cook and the chokra boy. I had prepared them for this plan.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018After a while, I began to accept concert engagements. On my return after one such trip, Sivakozhundu announced joyfully, \u201cMama! Manoranjitam and I are going to get married. She has decided to give up acting on the stage.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018I became distraught. What a trial! I had agreed to the deception only for the sake of Tambi getting well. How could I agree to this wedding! Can the truth be hidden forever from him? What would happen when he came to know it?</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018All these objections had no impact on Vanaja. \u201cIt is I who will bear the consequences. Why are you worried?\u201d she argued. Somehow she extracted my consent with her sobs and tears. She made her mother consent as well.</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018One month later, we performed their wedding at the Tirunageswarar temple.\u2019 With these words, Kandappa Pillai fell silent, as if sunk in deep thought. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018What comes next?\u2019 I asked him. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Well, my nephew and niece are very happy. They have two lovely little boys now.\u2019 </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I was not satisfied. I felt he had left something unsaid. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Where are they now?\u2019 I asked. </span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j6miM7VZ5fo/UCnP9vcKAgI/AAAAAAAABAk/ZyHAypwu2F0/s1600/NathaswaramThavul-2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j6miM7VZ5fo/UCnP9vcKAgI/AAAAAAAABAk/ZyHAypwu2F0/s1600/NathaswaramThavul-2.jpg" /></a><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Have you heard of Mundirisolai, swami? It is on the seashore between Karaikkal and Muttupettai. The Mariamman temple in Mundirisolai is very famous. It is a beautiful village. Cashew trees and casuarinas grow all around it as far as the eye can see. On the east, beyond the groves, there is a wilderness of reeds. Beyond that, a sea full of waves. Roaring waves and soughing casuarina are perpetual sounds there.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Mundirisolai is my native village. I have a small house and some land there. Sivakozhundu had visited this village twice or thrice in the days of his glory. He often used to say he loved the place, and that, if ever he retired from his concert career, he would like to live there.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018A few days after the wedding, Tambi said that he wanted my house in Mundirisolai as he wished to go and live there. I tried to dissuade him. \u201cWhat does loss of sight matter? That should not make you stop performing. In the past, didn\u2019t Sarabha Sastri play the flute though he was blind? Don\u2019t worry that you won\u2019t be asked to play at concerts. You will have a surfeit of them.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018All that was in vain. He insisted stubbornly, \u201cWe will see about all that later. I want to stay in the village for a few years. I don\u2019t even want to touch the nagaswaram for a while.\u201d That is how he left with Vanaja for Mundirisolai. They are there now.\u2019</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">That was how Kandappa Pillai brought his story to an end for the second time. And yet I was not satisfied. I believed his account of Sivakozhundu\u2019s unexpected loss of eyesight because I had witnessed similar unlikely events in my own life. But I simply could not find it credible that Vanaja had transformed herself into Manoranjitam convincingly enough to deceive Sivakozhundu. Was it possible to practice such deceit even on a blind man? Perhaps such deception could succeed before marriage, but was it possible to continue it afterwards?</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018So Sivakozhundu never found out that he had been tricked?\u2019 I asked.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Swami! How many nights of sleeplessness do you think I endured because of just this thought? Will Tambi discover the truth? Will he fall into a rage? What will he do? I was never free from these fears. This fear and my love for the couple drew me often to Mundirisolai. I made it a point to visit them at least once in four months. But I was happy to see them leading a very happy life together.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span id="goog_960640420"></span><span id="goog_960640421"></span>\u2018Once, on such a visit, I saw Tambi\u2019s instrument in the main room. I also saw a sruti box beside it. \u201cDoes Tambi play the nagaswaram now?\u201d I asked. \u201cSometimes he plays at night. I accompany him on the drone,\u201d Vanaja told me.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span id="goog_960640413"></span><span id="goog_960640414"></span>\u2018Fortunately I had my tavil with me. That night I insisted that he play the nagaswaram and I accompanied him on the tavil. What an experience that was! Swami, it was not music of this earth, but of the spheres. At times you choked, at times you wanted to laugh. Suddenly you were lifted somewhere high into the skies, and then plunged as if from the top of a mountain to the world below. Sometimes you felt you were swinging gently, and then you felt impelled to get up and dance in a frenzy. There were moments when I stopped playing the tavil and burst into cries of wonder.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018When I realized that Tambi had started playing again, I began to go more frequently to Mundirisolai. As time passed, my fears diminished. I thought that he would never discover the truth after all this time.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Some three or four years after they had settled in Mundirisolai, on one of my visits, I absent-mindedly called my niece by her real name. I was panic-stricken.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018\u201cVanaja? Who\u2019s that, Mama!\u201d Sivakozhundu asked.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018\u201cThere\u2019s no Vanaja here, I called out my niece\u2019s name absent-mindedly. \u201c</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018\u201cNever mind, Mama! My wife is also your niece. If you like the sound of Vanaja, by all means call her by that name,\u201d said he.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018I thanked God for the respite.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018That night Sivakozhundu played the nagaswaram as he usually did. When he played Sahana, I was so overwhelmed that I cried out the Lord\u2019s name in ecstasy. When he finished I broke down. \u201cTambi! It is God who is blind. How could He gift you such genius and snatch your eyes away!\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018That was when Sivakozhundu said with a smile, \u201cMama! Truly God did not snatch my eyes from me. In fact, he gave my eyes back to me. Didn\u2019t I prefer another woman to Vanaja? Who could have been more blind?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018I was completely taken off my guard. \u201cTambi! What are you saying?\u201d I said.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018\u201cMama! You tried to trick me because I was blind. But it was I who deceived you. I knew her to be Vanaja on the very first day she came to the hospital,\u201d he said.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Just then Vanaja joined us. From the smile on her face, I realized that she had colluded with him in this matter.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018\u201cVanaja! Were you with him in this plot? Did you know that Tambi knew the truth even before you got married?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018\u201cNo, Mama! I knew it only the day after the wedding. But he made me promise that I wouldn\u2019t tell you. It was his punishment for your trying to trick him.\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018\u201cSo you two are together in this! I am the odd man out. What have I left to stay for? I\u2019m leaving,\u201d said I.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018In reality, I was delighted. But I pretended to sulk. With great difficulty they reconciled me to the situation!</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Once I got over my \u201canger\u201d, I said, \u201cNever mind, Tambi! But you said you recognized Vanaja from day one. How?\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Sivakozhundu\u2019s answer stunned me utterly.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018\u201cIf God takes one sense away, he sharpens another. Yes, Mama! I lost my eyes, but my ears grew very keen. As soon as I heard her bangles, I knew it was Vanaja. Besides, I knew for certain that Manoranjitam would never come. When I was breaking my oath at the Central Station, I heard her drunken laughter in the next room. I was disgusted. Would such a woman come to see me? Certainly not. The real surprise was that you tried to trick me with such a big lie. I guessed the reason for it. You mistook for passion the disgust which made me babble on and on about Manoranjitam. Any doubts I had vanished when Vanaja sang \u2018Padamudiyadini tuyaram\u2019.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018\u201cMama! You call yourself a connoisseur? How could you not discern the difference between the tone of the actress and that of your niece? True, the ragam, voice and melodic embellishments were just the same. But there was no soul in Manoranjitam\u2019s singing. It was all crooning from the throat. But your niece sang from the depths of her heart. And you couldn\u2019t tell the difference!\u201d</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u2018Well, that is how my nephew and niece made a fool of me. But I was not unhappy. I felt a burden slip away from my heart. I wanted the young people to be happy. What have I to worry about? This is the age for cultivating detachment. I have experienced the joys and sorrows of life. I have even felt the celestial bliss of Tambi\u2019s music. I am ready to leave when the Lord calls me\u2026\u2019</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The train came to a halt at Vizhupuram Station. Kandappa Pillai\u2019s chokra boy got down from another compartment and came to take his unrolled bed and trunk. Patting the tavil once, Kandappa Pillai picked it up himself and got down. \u2018Goodbye, Ayya! I will see you when I come into the city,\u2019 he said and went his way.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I couldn\u2019t sleep for the rest of that night. I pondered over the amazing events narrated by Ivampettai Kandappan. Were they true? Or figments of Kandappa Pillai\u2019s imagination? I must enquire more into the matter when I see him next and find out the truth.</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Well, whether truth or fiction, in one way the story made me feel content. For, unlike my own stories, which end in grief, hadn\u2019t he concluded his with the auspicious \u2018They lived happily ever after\u2019?</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span><br />\u000a<div style="text-align: right;"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Concluded)</span></b></div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Copyright 2012 Gowri Ramnarayan</span></b>.</div><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div></div>
