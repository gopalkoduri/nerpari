Unfortunately, while the concert\u2014an excellent one with the brothers in great voice and the accompanists, especially the subtly supportive mridanga vidwan KV Prasad, in very good form\u2014was very well attended, the Sruti presentation and the Pinakapani tributes on 19 August drew only a small number of visitors.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"><br />\u000a</span> <span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">The enthusiasm and concert intelligence of the Malladi Brothers made them a joy to behold and hear. Here are two splendid voices that do credit to the best vocal traditions of Carnatic music. So powerful are their voices that it is easy to imagine that the siblings can be clearly heard in a microphone-less space. There was much exuberance in the concert which was marked by firm adherence to the traditional underpinnings of the Pinakapani-Nedunuri school, also represented in the audience by Malladi Suribabu, the singers\u2019 father and \u2018associate\u2019 guru.&nbsp; What was perhaps less evident in the busy first half was the quietude typical of a Nedunuri performance, the saukhyam the brothers are no doubt capable of, though the padam-javali segment offered much mellow relief.&nbsp; The occasional gentle touch can enhance the depth of the brothers' indubitable feeling for melody and lyric, and they will certainly transport listeners to even greater listening pleasure.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"><br />\u000a</span> <span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">The organizers, the SGBS Trust, have done yeoman service to Carnatic music for over three decades in their (once) quiet corner of the garden city, and even more admirable deeds in providing top class engineering and management education to the underprivileged at their top class facility at Unnati Centre, and have succeeded in gathering full houses for their concerts of the established and emerging stars of Carnatic music. Their missionary zeal is evident in the care they take over every little detail and they are great hosts, as we found out (Sruti plans to do a feature story on Unnati soon). Yet, a couple of aspects of the organization, perhaps an imitation of established practice at Chennai, spoil the total impact somewhat.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"><br />\u000a</span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jTq6irqF6SA/UDiWiC7q-iI/AAAAAAAABK8/l7ktJsylBsI/s1600/pinakapani1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; cssfloat: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jTq6irqF6SA/UDiWiC7q-iI/AAAAAAAABK8/l7ktJsylBsI/s320/pinakapani1.jpg" width="224" yda="true" /></a></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">The first problem was the inescapable gaudiness of stage backdrops and banners proclaiming the event and its sponsors. I was shocked to see Sruti\u2019s own banner staring at me when the curtains went up. All over the world, the best music concerts and dance performances banish this kind of advertisement to other parts of the concert hall, and it is time for us to follow suit. We can do without such loudness and poor taste.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"><br />\u000a</span> <span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">The second irritant endemic to our concerts is the habit of speechmaking interrupting the concert. Both Mala Mohan who made the documentary film\u2014a moving tribute to Pinakapani\u2014and Ramesh Swamy of SGBS Trust proved to be skilful speakers and true sahrdayas judging by their eloquence and appreciation of the music, but it is time again to put an end to the practice of speechmakers coming between the artists and the audience.&nbsp; It is quite simply bad manners!</span></div></div>
