V<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">By MV Swaroop</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cWhen did I play this korvai?\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cCan\u2019t remember, Sir. Two-three years ago, I think.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cSing it again.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />And so I sing, on our way to Central Station.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cBhale, bhale,\u201d he says, \u201cWe forget stuff we played. So often mridangists play something in my concert and tell me it\u2019s my korvai! And I do one, \u2018Oh, apdiya,\u2019 and re-learn my own korvai from them!\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Then he goes silent for a while, and asks, when we are on the bridge and waiting for the signal to turn into Central, \u201cCan you change it to 5-7-9? 5-6-7 is nice, but 5-7-9 will be nicer.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I try. It fails - the numbers don\u2019t add up. I try many combinations, as we park, buy a platform ticket (those things cost <span style="color: #333333; font-family: &quot;Rupee Foradian&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">`</span> 5 now!), and settle down on two chairs as we wait for the platform announcement. I can see that he\u2019s also calculating.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The platform is announced, the train arrives. We walk down to the compartment. It\u2019s a long walk -- the AC compartment is right at the end. At one point, an idea strikes me. I tell him, \u201cIt can be done!\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cHmmm. Tell me on the train.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />We reach the train, he has a side lower berth right by the door. He\u2019s not happy, but he can\u2019t help it. We find resting places for his luggage, he makes me elaborately chain all the luggage to the hoops under the seat, \u201cWe have to be very careful, pa. He\u2019s too smart for us!\u201d I am not sure who the \u201che\u201d exactly is, but I just smile.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Then I tell him my solution. He responds with a, \u201cHmmm. It\u2019s nice - nothing wrong with it. But I want the gaps to be 3 only - that will be more beautiful.\u201d I can see where he\u2019s coming from, but there is no solution where the gaps are 3. I nod, and say, \u201cI\u2019ll think.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />He says, \u201cSeri, pa. I\u2019m coming back by the Shatabdi on Monday night.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cI\u2019ll come pick you up.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cThanks, pa. Run along, now. Paavam, it\u2019s 11 o clock. You should sleep.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Little does he know that I\u2019ll only waste time on Facebook if I go back home.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I trek back up the platform, when an idea strikes me. I stop just near the start of the platform and go over it in my head. A solution! I check and double check it. There\u2019s no doubt, it is correct. I glance at the time. I have five minutes before the train leaves. The compartment is quite some distance away. I wonder if I should go back. I decide to, and then I decide against. Then, I decide to again, and then, I dither again. I realise that my indecision will only waste more time.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I run back to the compartment\u2014right at the end of the platform, a two minute run that makes me proud. Three minutes to departure. I get inside only to find him fast asleep. I consider waking him up, but I decide against it. I get off the train, and sit on a bench by the platform till it leaves. I send a message to my guru in Bangalore, also Sir\u2019s student, who will pick him up at the station, <i>\u201cWhen you see him in the morning, tell Sir I have an idea for the korvai we were discussing.\u201d</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />My phone rings at 5.30 am, and I hear Sir\u2019s excited voice at the other end, \u201cSollu, pa!\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />It takes me a couple of seconds to register what is happening, \u201cOh. Sir! Korvai! Solren.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Groggily, I sing it. It comes out all wrong the first time. I say, \u201cSorry, Sir. Will say it again.\u201d This time, it fits perfectly. He listens to it, considers it for a couple of seconds, and laughs, \u201cBhale! Seriya poch, po!\u201d He goes over it again, muttering the sollu-s partly loudly and partly under his breath, and says, \u201cAh, bhale bhale.\u201d Then, he tells me that he will call my Periamma about some directions he wants to someone\u2019s house, reminds me that he\u2019s coming back on the Shatabdi, tells me to \u201cozhunga\u201d practise on Sunday, and says with an air of finality, \u201cOkkbye, pa.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u201cOkkbye, Sir.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Click.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
