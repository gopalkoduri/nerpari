Twenty one-year old vocalist Aishwarya Shankar possesses all these plus a clear focus towards classicism in music.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />This Kolkata born and bred girl who completed her schooling in that city shifted to Chennai to further her music training. While most musically talented youngsters take to professional courses in engineering, medicine, accountancy and management, Aishwarya\u2019s focused vision directed her to take up B.A. (Music). She has now decided to do her Masters and then aspires to move on to the doctoral level in music, taking in her stride the positives and the negatives the field will inevitably throw up.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Aishwarya\u2019s paternal grandfather was a diehard fan of Carnatic music and her doctor father Shankar learnt to play the veena from \u2018Calcutta\u2019 Anantharama Bhagavatar \u2013 popularly known as Ambi Sir \u2013 of the <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_2206.html" target="_blank">Dikshitar</a> tradition. Aishwarya\u2019s mother has also learnt Carnatic music. In such an environment, Aishwarya started her musical training at the age of four with Indira Ranganathan, a respected teacher in Kolkata of vocal music and veena. This continued for fourteen years and when Aishwarya\u2019s family shifted to Chennai in 2008, she came under the tutelage of vidushi Suguna Varadachari, a major guru in Chennai. Her repertoire as on date is more than 450 \u2018uruppadi-s\u2019 or items \u2013 a major achievement for one so young. She is a recipient of the Government of India scholarship for advanced music training.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />When her father was pursuing FRCA in England, Aishwarya gave a few public concerts there when she was only ten years old. Back in Kolkata, she continued to give concerts, including in the two prestigious sabha-s \u2013 South India Club and Rasika Ranjani Sabha. After shifting base to Chennai, she has performed in numerous cities and towns in India, including a concert at the Shanmukhananda Sangettha Sabha in Mumbai.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />While in Kolkata, she learnt the structure of pallavi-s from a family friend, T. Chandramouli, who also taught her a few \u2018nadai\u2019 pallavi-s. Suguna Varadachari has also taught her many pallavi-s. However, inclusion of an RTP in the present day concert format of less than two hours is quite difficult.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Some notable features of Aishwarya\u2019s music are a mellifinous voice, purity of pathantara, clarity and diction, and excellent sruti and laya alignment. Good manodharma and excellent use of \u2018ghana\u2019 and \u2018naya\u2019 (\u2018vallinam\u2019 and \u2018mellinam\u2019) ingredients are additional attributes.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Aishwarya boasts an envious record of winning prizes in music competitions conducted by various sabha-s. For instance, in the competitions conducted by the Mylapore Fine Arts Club in 2008, she won nine prizes out of 10 events. In the competitions conducted by Narada Gana Sabha the same year, she won in 12 of 14 events. She bagged 21 prizes out of 22 at the Music Academy\u2019s competitions held in 2009. She won the first prize in an inter-collegiate competition in Chennai in 2010, with five Sangita Kalanidhi-s and a Sangita Acharya as judges. She also won the Sangeeta Sri award in a tough competition held by R.R. Sabha, Tiruchi, in 2008. Aishwarya has won five \u201ctambura prizes\u201d at various competitions which include the Rajaji Tambura prize of the Tamil Isai Sangam and the Narayani Ammal Tambura prize.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Along with vocal music, Aishwarya also learnt Bharatanatyam for fourteen years, but focused as she is on music, she has placed dance on the backburner.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />We are certain to hear much more about this talented youngster in the days to come.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: right;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(Reproduced from <a href="http://sruti.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=4_6&amp;products_id=296" target="_blank">Sruti 321, June 2011</a>)</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
