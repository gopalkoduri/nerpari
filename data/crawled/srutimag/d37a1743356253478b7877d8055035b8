Sarasama\u2014my guru KJ Sarasa\u2014was sitting\u000ain front of me at our Rani Annadurai Street dance class, supervising me\u000arehearsing the varnam that I was to present for my arangetram. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">She whispered into the ears of\u000aour musician, Gowri Akka, \u201cLook at her lovely araimandi, she is almost in a\u000aperfect half sit. She is really out there to impress Padma Amma.\u201d I, the 12\u000ayear old who knew that a compliment from Sarasama was as rare as a perfect\u000aaraimandi in rehearsal, was surely peeking my ears to listen in even as I was\u000adancing, and needless to say was ecstatic at my guru\u2019s observation. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Of course, I was working hard to\u000aimpress Dr.Padma Subrahmanyam, Paddu Akka, who was to be the chief guest at my\u000aarangetram. I don\u2019t know if I managed to impress her with my arangetram but I\u000awas yet again so inspired by her. Her dazzling big jhumkas were also a great\u000aattraction. I pestered my parents soon after my arangetram to buy me similar\u000ajhumkas. They did and the first day I wore those jhumkas, I felt truly like her\u000afan! One that wanted to follow her and her path.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Incidentally it was this\u000aaraimandi pushed me in the direction of a thought process that was to shape me\u000ainto a researcher too. One day I was sitting with TSP Mama (Sri TS\u000aParthasarathy, the musicologist) in his home during my classes with him. He\u000aspoke of the basic stance and suddenly asked to demonstrate it. I stood up and\u000aproudly showed off my half sit. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">He smiled and said, \u201cDo you know\u000awhat the texts describe the araimandi to be? It is the halving of the lower\u000abody starting from the torso in equal proportion to one\u2019s own upper body.\u000aTherefore, it is the subjective calculation of each person\u2019s height and torso\u000alength and it is the careful halving of that\u201d. I was stumped. He further added\u000awith a chuckle, \u201cAnything more than this proportion would look like you are\u000asitting on a potty!\u201d Mortified, I sat through the next few hours with Mama only\u000ahalf listening to him speak on concepts of aucityam (propriety), soundaryam\u000a(beauty) and much more.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I came home that day and\u000asuddenly felt a rush of inadequacy in my understanding of a form, I until then\u000abelieved I was introduced to in its entirety, at least as far as performance\u000awas concerned. I realized the need to look back at the grammar-s written down\u000ato codify what the mind, body and psyche produce. This intellectualization of\u000adance beckoned me. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I had to work at this process of understanding my\u000aBharatanatyam, a deeply personal journey through its historic course when much\u000aof its theorization was penned. As a student of history and archaeology, I was\u000aand am even now, fascinated by the Cholas of the Tamil country (like many\u000aothers). Rajaraja and his magnificent contribution that is the Rajarajeswaram\u000ais truly the holy grail. \u201cWhat did the Cholas dance? What repertoire? What\u000acompositions? How did they stitch the karanas into their choreography?\u201d were\u000asome of the impetus questions. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">So, I headed for ground zero. When I looked up and saw the board \u201cThanjavur\u000aSaraswati Mahal Library\u201d I felt fresh blood was being pumped into me. My first\u000avisit there as a serious researcher was in May 2006.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Armed with pen and paper, I walked in and got introduced\u000ato the Administrative Officer. After a very warm welcome he gently asked me if\u000aI would like a tour around the library. I said, \u201cYes, that would be great, but\u000aI wish to speak to the Sanskrit and Telugu Pundits regarding a few\u000amanuscripts\u201d. He looked completely taken aback. He quickly re-checked if I was\u000ain fact the \u201cactor/dancer\u201d Swarnamalya. When I smiled and replied in the\u000aaffirmative he asked me what I wanted to do in a library!<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">This is the general perception that people have.\u000aWhen doctors, lawyers and other professionals engage in research, people take\u000athem seriously, but when people in the entertainment world talk of research\u000a(especially younger women) it is eyebrow-raising! Quite used to it, I explained\u000apatiently to him that Dance was my passion and that I was a Masters Degree holder\u000ain Bharatanatyam. If he was surprised, he didn\u2019t show it and quietly guided me\u000ato the Telugu Mss section.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Thrilled, I subjected the Telugu scholar to a long\u000amonologue of how I needed to understand the connection between the dances of\u000athe Chola period and that of the Tanjore Quartette (what we essentially\u000apractise and perform). He looked at me blankly, and told me that I could go\u000athrough the catalogue of the Mss and see what I wanted to investigate.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I sat there at his spartan desk, under the tall\u000atombed, lime-washed pillars, on a wooden chair and grabbed the first catalogue\u000afor Mss. That day passed. A tap on my shoulder from my\u000adriver/guardian/confidant Kumar reminded me that it was 5 pm and time for the\u000alibrary to close.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">All day, everyday for the next four days and similar four/five days for the next three months, all I did was pore over the\u000acatalogues religiously. I made detailed notes of every Mss I wanted to see,\u000acheck, read. I went to the Sanskrit, Tamil, and Marathi sections and did the\u000asame.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="background: white; line-height: 14.4pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">After\u000aa few months, I recognized my first understanding of dance history. Much of\u000acontemporary dance history of the South is steered towards seeing its hoary\u000apast and links to Vedic and early historic extant texts like the Natya Sastra.\u000aWhile this link is undeniable, it is from the immediate cultural memory that\u000athe performing traditions of today have been culled out. Its copula to\u000a\u201cSadir-attam\u201d, \u201cdasi-attam\u201d and also its close link to geographical and\u000apolitical structures are its rich traditions. It is from these numerous\u000acorpuses of dance repertoire that the Tanjore Quartette and others excogitated\u000athe margam. Therefore, to comprehend the Chola dances I must find a tall ladder\u000athat will take me from the known (Bharatanatyam) to the unknown through its\u000avarious immediate past memories. The association between art and political\u000apower shift is an important paradigm too. The study of dance in the context of\u000aa political, racial shift is the key to unlock this attic.<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><i><br /></i></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><i>From the attic </i>is a\u000ajourney through the immediate past centuries when the memories of modern\u000aBharatanatyam and Carnatic music were created. My seven years of research have\u000ahelped me identify the context of the art forms we practise and thereby find a\u000apersonal identity. <i>From the attic </i>is a process of reverse engineering, I\u000acould say. It will reflect the various processes, lives of people, stories and\u000aanecdotes from these eras. I hope to write about some of these in the issues to\u000acome. <o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Still in possession of my\u000ajhumkas, I endeavour to continue in this path, which makes me a performer and a\u000aresearcher turning the torch on to the corners hidden in the attic!<o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><br /></b></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><i>FROM THE ATTIC: </i>a performance, lecture, exhibition\u000aseries of the past performing practices by </b><b><i>Dr\u000aSwarnamalya Ganesh, </i>with a key to unlock the attic</b></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
