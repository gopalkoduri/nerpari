She spoke about her ideas on Carnatic and Hindustani music and her career as a Carnatic violinist.</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>The Lalgudi bani</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />It is basically a vocal bani demonstrated on the violin. We take extra care to follow the lyrics when we approach a composition. The glides and intonations typical of vocal music are closely simulated on the violin. It is very heartening when rasikas tell us that they can actually hear the lyrics when we play the violin. Not only the fingering but also the bowing has been developed by my guru and father Lalgudi Jayaraman to bring out the nuances and continuity typical of vocal music. The Lalgudi bani pays attention to emotions and aesthetics.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The influence of her late grandmother</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Savitri Ammal, my father\u2019s mother who passed away recently, was an iron-willed lady, hard working, emotionally very strong\u2014which is why she could be a silent spectator when Grandfather put Appa and my aunts through a rigorous upbringing. She could sing from memory all the folk songs composed by her mother-in-law. She was quite a cerebral person who enthusiastically solved puzzles and riddles. It was quite a sight to watch her play board games with my father when she was over eighty. She was a repository of proverbs and interesting folklore.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>The different challenges of violin solo, duets with brother Krishnan, as accompanist to vocal artists and in jugalbandi</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />As a soloist I am at liberty to draw the outline of the concert and the flow of my expression and imagination. In duets with my brother, it is he who leads and I thoroughly enjoy the challenges posed by him, to go with the flow of his imagination and to sync with him. As an accompanist I strive to give my best and support the main artiste and embellish the concert. It is also important to make an indelible mark in an understated way. When it is a jugalbandi concert, it is important to respect the other artist's creativity and to give her space to express herself. Kalaji and I have perfect understanding and respect for each other\u2019s music.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Her take on the Carnatic system as different from Hindustani</span></b></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />In the Carnatic system, we have very intricate, quick moving gamakas as opposed to the straight notes and long glides of Hindustani music. <i>(She demonstrates by singing a melodic phrase in the Carnatic Dwijawanti and contrasts it with the Hindustani Jaijaiwanti)</i> On the violin particularly as opposed to instruments with frets, you have to be very precise in the manner of creating the gamaka.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>Comparison with taans in the Hindustani system</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Imagine a graph showing the melodic movement. In the Hindustani style you would see straight lines going up and down, connecting dots (pitches). In Carnatic music, you would see twirls, rounded lines connecting many more dots (pitches). We use overtones extensively. <i>(She demonstrates by singing gamakas in the Carnatic raga Todi touching varied semi-tones and comments that in the corresponding Hindustani raga Bhairavi the notes are handled very differently).</i> When our gamakas travel, we deceptively make the musical note sound as if it is within the raga. More semi-tonal variations are used to infuse the Carnatic flavour.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>The Lalgudi bani vis-a-vis the straight note approach of Hindustani music</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />My father does feel that using straight notes can add great beauty to the Carnatic system. <i>(She demonstrates a melodic movement in Kharaharapriya first in the chaste Carnatic format, then using straight notes and meends in the Hindustani style).</i> Many of my father\u2019s compositions use the feature and it is a unique aspect of his bani.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>Preferred ragas do in jugalbandi with Hindustani musicians</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />For my USA tour this time, Kala and I chose to play Charukesi, Kiravani and also Dharmavati (with Kala playing Madhuvanti). These are not really hard-core Carnatic ragas but they hold an important place in the Carnatic system. <i>(She demonstrates the ascent and descent in Dharmavati as well as Madhuvanti).</i> The Hindustani Madhuvanti skips \u201cri\u201d and \u201cdha\u201d in the ascent as opposed to Dharmavati and that adds a unique flavour.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>On-stage communication between main artist and percussionist</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />In the Hindustani system, the tabla player is maintaining the taal cycle and keeping track of beats and movements while in the Carnatic system, the accompanist improvises, maintaining the tempo. When I play a composition, I keep track of the tala in my mind rather than take a cue from the mridangist. Hindustani artists have to keep track of tabla \u201cbols\u201d \u2013 and therefore the rapport between the artistes is much closer than in the Carnatic system. The body language changes as the main artist plays along with the percussionist and Hindustani musicians communicate differently with their accompanists.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>Playing the electric violin</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I have played it once or twice. When it comes to sound, I am quite conservative in my taste and choice. I love the natural timbre and tone of the violin. I even hesitate to use the contact mike to amplify the sound of my violin. My brother and I travel together and play duets. Two years ago, when we were playing in Amsterdam for a music festival, we were asked to go to the concert hall at 3 pm for a sound check for a 6 pm performance. The hall looked like an opera house and could seat 300 people. When we went on stage and started to play the violin, we found that the smallest sound was so amplified because of the acoustics of the hall \u2013 we decided perform without microphones. The concert was sold out and listeners sat in complete silence while we played. It was a wonderful experience.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>The future of the violin</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The violin is and will continue to be emperor of instruments. Whether it is classical, film or semi-classical ghazals, you will always find the violin as an accompanying instrument and of course, it has a unique place as a solo instrument. We've come a long way. Carnatic music needs more attention on a global level. It is my dream and desire to contribute in a significant way to the celebration of our music globally.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
