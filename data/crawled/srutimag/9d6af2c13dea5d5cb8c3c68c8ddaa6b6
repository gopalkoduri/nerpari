He had given at least 200 concerts before, including far more important ones, but he was edgy all morning. He tuned and re-tuned his mridangam every fifteen minutes, until even he couldn\u2019t tell the difference between the sound before and after the tuning. He then took to ironing his veshti with a vengeance. The dhobi had done a stellar job, but Anna wasn\u2019t satisfied. He had chosen a kurta on the previous day - something he\u2019d never done before - but that morning, he decided to fish another one out. This one was crumpled. So, it was taken to the dhobi again and ironed under Anna\u2019s personal supervision.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cIs your girlfriend coming to the kutcheri?\u201d Appa asked tactlessly. Anna answered with a scowl. Then, he purposefully walked out of the house, returned in two minutes, unearthed his first mridangam book and read some very fundamental rhythms with nervous concentration.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I sat quietly with the newspaper through all the drama - the Sunday Crossword in the Hindu was always hard.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Suddenly Anna asked me, \u201cAre you coming to the kutcheri?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cWho\u2019re you playing for?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cAvi.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cOh. Is he good?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cYeah. Why do you ask?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cNo, you seem nervous...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cI-I-I... I\u2019m not nervous!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cNo, the thing is, you\u2019re revising some basics and all. I just thought you were playing for someone big.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cI always revise!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">That was a lie, but there was no use in pointing it out to him in this mood. I went back to my crossword. I hate it when the Sunday Crossword requires you to know the names of port towns to the east of Essex. Or wait, maybe \u201ceast\u201d was \u201ce\u201d and Essex was... Curious and Curiouser. I stared on.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Lunch was served. Anna ate nothing. Appa and I had a cursory discussion on clues in the crossword. Amma, who just returned from her sister\u2019s house gave us a detailed report on our cousin\u2019s lives. One hadn\u2019t done well in his semester exams, a cause for worry for everyone, and the other had rejected the fourth \u201cboy\u201d who came to see her.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Amma suddenly asked Anna, \u201cThis Avi is a nice boy, no?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Anna distractedly said, \u201cYeah.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cWhat gotram?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cMa, I\u2019m not his horoscoper!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cIs that even a word?\u201d I asked.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cPoor chores are future-tellers!\u201d Appa declared.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I laughed.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Anna muttered something and left the table. Amma was about to get up to console him, when Appa said, \u201cLeave him alone.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Lunch resumed. \u201cPoor chores! Too much, Pa!\u201d Appa\u2019s speed with anagrams always amazed me.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cDai, forty years of solving the crossword...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Just then, Anna stormed into the dining room, picked up his bike keys from the table, and charged out purposefully.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Amma asked.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cNeed to buy some stuff.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cHair gel.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cWhat?!\u201d I asked.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">He didn\u2019t answer.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cThere\u2019s coconut oil in my cupboard. Use that,\u201d Appa said, and added softly, \u201cGel spoils your hair.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d said Amma this time.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The sound of the door banging was following by the roar of Anna\u2019s bike.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The three of us settled down into a bad afternoon movie on Sun TV. Appa and Amma dozed off as the first dream sequence, consisting of extras in embarrassing costumes and the hero and heroine in equally garish, but contrasting clothes. They declared their love to each other for this life and all their reincarnations. I wondered what would happen if, in the next life, one was born to a descendant of Osama, and the other to a descendant of Obama.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Soon, sleep overtook my senses, and I had a strange dream of a wrestling match between Osama and Obama with Anna in a veshti as the referee. As the wrestling intensified, and Osama stood on the rope to jump on Obama, a loud bell rang around the stadium, and a voice spoke through the microphone, \u201cUncle! Saar, Harish, Saar!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I woke up. Appa was already walking towards the door. There was urgency in the voice calling him. I joined him at the door. Senthil, the watchman from the adjacent apartment complex, spoke very fast, \u201cArjun was turning into the main road, and he skidded and fell. I was going on my moped, and I took him on it to the hospital. His phone wasn\u2019t working, so I came here.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cIs he okay?\u201d Appa asked.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cThey\u2019ve asked him to get an x-ray of his arm.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Appa and I rushed to the hospital to find Anna\u2019s chosen kurta soaked in blood and wet mud from the recent rains. But his arm was the cause for worry, the doctor told us. It was a fracture.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Anna\u2019s first reaction was, \u201cFracture-aa? Six weeks-aa? Today\u2019s kutcheri?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cKuttan will play,\u201d Appa said, pointing to me.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cNo.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cWhy not?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cHe\u2019s... He\u2019s not good enough. No offence, Kuttan.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I hadn\u2019t taken any offence. I was used to being treated like a back-up option.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cAvi isn\u2019t that good. He can make do with Kuttan.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cNo. Let me call Sir. He\u2019ll suggest someone else.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sir suggested my name, and the matter was settled.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">There was something dubious about Anna\u2019s behaviour. I had played in quite a few concerts myself, and although I didn\u2019t have Anna\u2019s wisdom, inventiveness or promise, I was steady. While reviewers showered praises on Anna and his \u2018impeccable control and understanding of laya aspects\u2019 or his \u2018spectacular tani\u2019, they reduced me to a mere reference, \u2018S.H. Anil on the mridangam provided apt support\u2019. There was, therefore, no reason for Anna to get all nervous about the concert.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I would provide apt support.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Anna called me towards him and whispered in my ear, \u201cNo naughtiness. Play the way you play usually, and come back home.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cNo. No mischief.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cOk da. Whatever.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Amidst all the drama, I reached the concert slightly late. The others were already on stage setting up by then. I settled myself on the right of Avi, in the customary spot for the mridangist. Avi whispered to me, \u201cDai, I\u2019m nervous.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cChill, da. You\u2019ve done this before.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cBig crowd, da. Usually there\u2019s only Amma in the front row putting talam, and a few relatives here and there.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll do fine. We are here to support you.\u201d Just as I said that last line, I glanced at my co-supporter - the violinist, a young girl from Bangalore. Slim, classical features, pottu, flowers adorning long hair, silk sari and ethereal grace, she explained every little aspect of Anna\u2019s behaviour through the day. If she was a decent musician in addition, there was nothing more one wanted from life. Poor Anna\u2014on painkillers, with his arm in a cast. Here, my life was playing out in slow-motion, like in the movies.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Avi started with the majestic varnam in Narayanagowlai. His rendition, though, was anything but majestic. He was nervous from the first note, sang as if he had only recently learnt it, and kept looking towards me for support. I kept the steady stream of fours going, not experimenting too much with the rhythm, especially with Avi looking like he\u2019d just eaten his angavastram by mistake. As he doubled the tempo, he completely lost track of the song.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">But he was seasoned enough to know what to do in these circumstances. He coughed, and started drinking water. The violinist looked at me and winked. It was our time in the sun, as life went into slow-motion mode again. We launched into the anupallavi, since the pallavi was suitably wrecked. I knew a couple of rhythm tricks to play here, and was about to execute them when I heard Anna\u2019s voice in my ear warning me against naughtiness. She didn\u2019t hold back though. There were a few touches whose deftness was masterly. They were always followed by a magical smile.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When Avi joined in for the second half of the varnam, he was rendered useless to the proceedings. True, the audience still listened to him. But the two of us were on a trip of our own, exchanging more than the occasional glance and smile as we led Avi though the swarams. The applause at the end was slightly unenthusiastic, but it didn\u2019t matter to me. Her eyes flirted in my direction before turning to Avi for the start of the next song.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Avi started an alapana. Five seconds into it, I concluded he was singing Arabhi. I set about watching her follow him through the alapana. Five phrases into the alapana, her left eyebrow rose in suspicion. Was he singing Devagandhari? Two seconds later, there was a definite touch of Arabhi again. And back to Devagandhari, and back and forth and back and forth till she decided to stop following him. He turned towards her nervously, as a phrase typical of Shaama escaped his mouth. The audience watched in collective horror. Avi might have cried, but controlled emotions and finished his unsure alapana.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">It was her turn to play now. But she didn\u2019t know what ragam to play. Her eyes asked me if I knew the answer. \u201cArabhi,\u201d I mouthed. Her eyes asked me why I thought so. I just nodded my head, as if I was sure. Truth be told, I wanted to hear Arabhi. She played an Arabhi, and I shook my head more vigorously than required, and Avi, hoping he\u2019d win some audience back, nodded his head vigorously too. Her alapana was followed by applause that sounded thankful. She had, after all, put the audience out of their misery.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Avi asked her sheepishly, \u201cShall I just get up and go? The two of you play.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I attempted Devagandhari.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cDude, chillax. Just sing something in Arabhi now,\u201d she replied.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I wondered if that was the first time that the words \u2018dude\u2019 and \u2018chillax\u2019 were used on the Carnatic concert stage.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Anna walked in with his cast, and settled in the third row, keeping a watchful eye on me.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The dubious Arabhi was followed by an equally dubious Varali, a trepidatious Mukhari, and a fast-paced Nalinakanti that defied all definitions of the ragam. Throughout, I kept myself under control, playing steadily as ever. Anna wouldn\u2019t like it if I engaged in \u2018mischief\u2019. Especially with her around. Avi then proceeded to ask \u201cBrochevarevarura?\u201d in Khamas. I was sure it couldn\u2019t be anyone listening to the question. When I thought of this and grinned, she grinned too, almost as if she had heard the joke. It was time for me to give Anna\u2019s warning the royal ditch - I had to show her my prowess, lest she thought I was just an apt, unimaginative mridangist.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I unleashed all my mathematics on the crowd in the tani. I even surprised myself with my competence. I had something more than encouraging reviews to play for! Something in me had mellowed down, though. I tended to play big-hitting solos in the past, producing loud volumes to get claps, and hopefully the adjective \u2018enthusiastic\u2019 instead of \u2018apt\u2019 in the reviews. On that day, I played with more poise, mirroring her approach to the violin. The audience decided to make up for the lack of thunderous mridangam with their applause.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Backstage, as we were leaving, she said, \u201cHey. \u2018Twas great fun! It\u2019s funny - people told me you were a really serious person.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cHa, that\u2019s my brother! He fractured his hand this afternoon. I was the last-minute replacement.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cOh. Nice meeting you,\u201d she said, walking away.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I gathered the courage to ask her, \u201cWhat are you doing tomorrow evening?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cNothing,\u201d she said.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cLet\u2019s go eat some... dosas?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">She laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019d prefer idlis.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">In the background, Anna muttered away, \u201cWhat was that dubious korvai you played, rascal?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">***<br />\u000a<span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia; font-size: 9pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">Copyright MV Swaroop, 2012</span></span></div><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div></div>
