Subhalakshmi, one of those child prodigies Carnatic music delights in throwing up every once in a while, is among the more sensitive violinists in the kutcheri world today. Born at Nagercoil, she hails from a musical family belonging to Akkarai village in Suchindram, Tamil Nadu, and went to school at New Delhi. Grandfather S.P. Siva Subramaniam was a musician and composer, grandmother R. Sornambal, a Harikatha exponent and father S. Swaminathan, a violinist who established the music school \u2018Swara Raga Sudha\u2019.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSubhalakshmi is a disciple of her father, whose intensive, unusual training methods helped her debut as a concert violinist when barely eight.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSubhalakshmi trained with the late V. Janakiraman for a couple of years and learnt vocal music from O.V. Subramanian and his daughter Padma Natesan in New Delhi. She now trains with P.S. Narayanaswamy and N. Ravikiran, whom she also accompanies in concerts.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aHer concerts with Ravikiran, sharing the platform with Umayalpuram Sivaraman on mridanga, or sometimes with A.K. Palanivel on the tavil, have been rewarding experiences. Among other leading musicians she has accompanied are M. Balamuralikrishna, N. Ramani, T.K. Govinda Rao, Shashank, P. Unnikrishnan, T.M. Krishna and Aruna Sayeeram.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSubhalakshmi owes much to her guru-father, who exposed her and her sister Sornalatha to the music of the great masters. He is a strict mentor and the sisters look towards him for approval even at concerts.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSubhalakshmi is known for her imaginative manodharma, and to be very quick on the uptake as an accompanist. Musicians of varying styles love to have her as their accompanist, as she adapts so well to them. She has worked hard to achieve a rich tone and smooth bowing style, and refuses to compromise her musical values.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAn A-grade artist of All India Radio, Chennai, Subhalakshmi has performed as a violin soloist and accompanist in many countries. She has been featured in prestigious events like the Indo-Russian culture exchange programme (1996), Theatre de la Ville festival (Paris), the Cleveland Tyagaraja Aradhana (U.S.A.), the farewell concert for Zubin Mehta (Munich) and the Mahatma Gandhi Institute Sangeet Utsav (Mauritius).</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSubhalakshmi, who has released many albums, performs violin and vocal duet concerts with her younger sister Akkarai S. Sornalatha, another talented young violinist and vocalist. The music of the Akkarai Sisters has been described as \u201cmature, fastidiously classical, suffused with unsentimental bhava.\u201d</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSubhalakshmi is a voracious reader and loves to listen to music. As a full time musician, she has had to opt for distance education, studying B.Com by correspondence at the Annamalai University.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAkkarai Subhalakshmi is one of our outstanding young musicians, whose best years are clearly in the future.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b>Awards and titles</b></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a\u25cf Rajiv Gandhi Yuva Puraskar from the President of India (1996); \u25cf Outstanding young violinist award from the Music Academy (1999, 2001, 2006 and 2007); \u25cf Inspiring child artist award from Valayapatti Naadalaya (1999); \u25cf Best performance award from the Music Academy (2001); \u25cf Ananda Vikatan award for the best violinist of the year (2001); \u25cf Yuva Kala Bharati from Bharat Kalachar (2002); \u25cf Naada Oli from Naada Inbam (2005); \u25cf Kalki Krishnamurthy Memorial Award (September 2007); \u25cf Spotted as one of India\u2019s 50 emerging stars in an issue of The Week magazine.</div></div>
