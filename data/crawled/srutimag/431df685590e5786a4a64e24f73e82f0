She has spoken of pressures and challenges through her seven-year tenure, and all of it has been written and spoken about extensively in the last month. Artists have expressed the view that she is irreplaceable as the institution\u2019s head, while some have questioned the wisdom of fixing age-limits to such positions, and even scoffed at the idea of an artist being questioned on the basis of \u201cprocedural niceties\u201d.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">We are awaiting Leela Samson\u2019s reply to our questions emailed to her, while Kalakshetra chairman Gopalkrishna Gandhi replied to our email on the subject as follows:</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201c\u2026 I have been getting shoalfuls of mail from enraged friends and colleagues and <br />\u000arasika-s of Leela.
