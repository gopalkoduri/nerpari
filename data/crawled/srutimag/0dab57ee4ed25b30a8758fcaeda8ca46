I found his support \u2018caring and committed\u2019 for <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2013/04/whos-who-in-classical-music.html" target="_blank">Alathur Srinivasa Iyer,</a> \u2018elegant and enchanting\u2019 for <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_04.html" target="_blank">Palghat K V Narayanaswamy</a> and so on. None could drift from his sruti-laya anchor and it was sheer delight when <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_29.html" target="_blank">Palghat Mani Iyer</a> was on the mridangam. With practically \u2018nil amplification\u2019 inside the Mandapam, music of the highest order soaked the oil lamp-lit precincts. Clad in \u2018temple dress\u2019 (as we describe it) and sporting his characteristic smile, Lalgudi exuded confidence and offered the best music. My only disappointment is that there was no <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_7011.html" target="_blank">MDR</a>-Lalgudi combination at the Mandapam.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />I also used to go to the Bhajanapura Palace to see the great vidwans at leisure and found Lalgudi relishing every moment of his stay at the vintage venue.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />My father often recollected Musiri\u2019s grand rendering of <i>Smarahari padaravindam </i>(a stellar composition of Swati Tirunal in Sama) at the Mandapam with Lalgudi. Belonging to the next generation, I never had the luck to hear it from Lalgudi at any time even in his solos. But I was really moved when a slice of the song was aired for a few seconds in the Regional News bulletin of AIR, Chennai, when the station reported the news of his demise. Though it was too late, I felt relieved to know that a recording was still available with AIR and that I could listen to the full complement of the song sometime. Will you kindly oblige, AIR?</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
