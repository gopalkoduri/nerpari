A job with AIR Madras made for closer association with Semmangudi, whose disciple and accompanist Kadayanallur became. Though his extreme reticence kept him out of the music circuit, one aspect of his talent fortunately came to be recognised without any effort on his part.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aMS was required to sing a range of new pieces for many occasions, and fresh compositions were in high demand. Recommended for the task by Semmangudi, the self-effacing Venkataraman found himself at MS Subbulakshmi\u2019s residence. There was nothing impressive in his brusque manner. Said MS, \u201cWhen he began to sing, I knew he was a godsend.\u201d Time and again, Kadayanallur was able to compose music that was perfect for MS\u2019s voice. The ragamalika <i>Kandu kandu</i> uniquely matched verse by melodic verse poet Poondanam Nambudiri\u2019s ranging reflections on the uncertainties of life. Kadayanallur\u2019s arrangement, brought to life by MS\u2019s spectacular rendition of the chorus <i>Krishna Krishna,</i> transformed a standard litany of the Lord\u2019s names into the expression of a philosopher\u2019s world weariness and human distress. Kadayanallur showed through this piece and many others that he could internalise the bhava and find the exact raga to expound core themes and emotions, valuable strengths in a composer.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aWhen the Tirupati Devasthanam decided to popularise the works of Annamacharya, the fourteenth-century poet credited with thousands of Telugu devotional lyrics, MS Subbulakshmi was entrusted with the job of recording his oeuvre. All the original music was lost, though a few songs could be acquired from vidwans like Nedunuri Krishnamurti who had set them to music. But most Annamacharya pieces had to be set to ragas afresh. MS loved to narrate how Kadayanallur came up with scores to suit every mood and every need. He could arrange a Kedaragowlai <i>(Koluvudi)</i> in an imposing grid, innovate a Kalyani chittaswaram (in <i>Sarvopayamuna</i>) beyond the pale, invent a playful Khamas <i>(Dolayam)</i> for the oonjal ritual, or conceive a Kapi <i>(Jo Achyutananda)</i> brimming with a mother\u2019s love for her child. Sometimes he surprised even himself, as when he set <i>Kannula dutite</i> in a raga he later decided had to be Jog. He tamed the lyrically unruly <i>Entamatramu</i> so that verses cascaded in a frenzy of devotion. \u201cI cannot forget the day he came in without a single word, played the sruti box and began to intone <i>Bhavayami gopalabalam</i> in Yamunakalyani,\u201d MS recalled. The song begins in tenderness and ends in rapture, as does that evergreen gem <i>Krishna ni begane.</i> MS would be shaken by a tingling shiver when she touched the suddha madhyamam in that song.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aTo watch Kadayanallur compose was an experience. Sitting on the mat, eyes closed, nothing but sruti in ear and mind, he came up with endless variations, all of them tailormade for Subbulakshmi\u2019s voice. He could get the best from her voice, whether glide, glissando, or plain note. A perfectionist, Kadayanallur monitored recording sessions to make them flawless. Sometimes, he played the tambura for MS, though few realised that the man in the rear had so much to do with the music she made.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe <i>Balaji Pancharatna Mala,</i> a set of five records (the sixth came later), was recorded by Subbulakshmi for the Tirupati Devasthanam. The focus was on Annamacharya, but a range of poets like Jayadeva and Chaitanya were also included.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aWhen the first LP record was released, it was placed on the Tirupati temple niche where copper plate engravings of Annamacharya\u2019s songs were accidentally discovered in the modern age. Listening to those recordings is to be astounded by the commitment of a singer who learned so many new compositions, getting every syllable right, every note right.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe project achieved its purpose. Today many of those songs are part of the music and the dance stage.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">What made the partnership so creative? Was it Kadayanallur\u2019s grasp of raga swarupa? His swara gnanam? Perhaps it was his attitude that struck a perfect chord with MS. He did not understand commercial goals. \u201cWe don\u2019t take up music as a profession because we want to make money. There are other, surer ways of making money. We take up music because ... Well, if you are the sort of person to whom I have to explain it, you won\u2019t understand anyway.\u201d It is clear that Kadayanallur didn\u2019t have to explain anything to Kunjamma. His gift of music and lack of worldliness assured him her abiding regard over 20 years.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b>Excerpted from <i>MS and Radha: Saga of Steadfast Devotion</i></b></div></div>
