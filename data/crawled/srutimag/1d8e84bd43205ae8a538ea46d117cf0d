We had heard a lot about this living legend being a great choreographer, excellent dancer, and above all a good friend and confidante to her students.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />True to her reputation, Rhadha performed a complete Vazhuvoor style margam, without cutting corners or compromising on fundamentals. Her performance at the age of 71 totally blew us away.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The highlight of the programme was her effortless string of <i>muzhu mandi adavu-s</i>, sprinkled generously throughout the nritta items. The quick transitions from standing to half sitting, to getting down on to the floor, then all the way up, without flinching, combined with her impeccable and powerful footwork (many a time improvised when you were least expecting it), felt surreal.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Rhadha began her programme with a traditional <i>pushpanjali,</i> followed by a beautiful Hanuman stuti, <i>Anjile onru petran</i>, from the Kamba Ramayanam. The song describes the five facets of Lord Hanuman in relation to the five elements. Born of the wind god, Hanuman crossed the mighty body of water, by leaping across (the sky) space to find Seeta, the daughter of mother Earth, and in a rage, he burned down Ravana\u2019s Lanka with fire. From the first item itself, we came under the spell of Rhadha\u2019s mesmerising dance.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The next item was a brisk <i>Chokkeswara kavuthuvam</i> in praise of Chokkanathar or Siva of Madurai. Rhadha delighted us in the <i>Mandooka Sabdam</i> by describing the scenic pond full of leaping and croaking frogs, where the story of <i>Gajendra moksha</i> takes place. The onomatopoaeic syllables in the lyrics were beautifully sung by Sindhu Natarajan.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The beautiful varnam, <i>Karunai seididal aagatha</i> in praise of Lord Kapaleeswara of Mylapore told the story of how goddess Karpagambal came into being. The five jati-s, including a mridanga jati\u2014nicely articulated by Vidya Balan and Sangita Vasudevan, two senior disciples of Rhadha\u2014were powerfully executed with unflagging stamina and perfection by Rhadha.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />During the intermission, the whole place was abuzz, with everyone talking about Rhadha\u2019s incredible jaw-dropping performance.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Rhadha opened the second half of the programme with <i>Yarukagilum bhayama?</i> in which she convincingly depicted a self-assured <i>abhisarika nayika</i> standing her ground.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />In the piece de resistance, <i>Krishna nee begane,</i> Rhadha awakened the vatsalya bhava in each one of us, by bringing to life baby Krishna delighting his mother Yasoda. The story of the Vamana avatara was seamlessly woven into the piece and delineated at the line, <i>Jagadoddharaka namma.</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The javali <i>Yera, rara</i> brought out yet another facet of Rhadha\u2019s uncanny ability to depict sambhoga sringara, with subtle and nuanced suggestions of romantic and intimate moments between the nayaka and the naive and boisterous nayika, who is tormented by Cupid\u2019s arrows.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The playful Mand tillana \u2013 a composition of Lalgudi G. Jayaraman \u2013 was the perfect finale for Rhadha\u2019s energetic and effervescent presentation, beautifully choreographed to sync with the lilting movements of the musical notes. The intricate, rhythmic and dynamic movements, interspersed with sculpturesque poses, were handled with ease and finesse, till the very end.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Sindhu Natarajan, a budding singer, provided melodious and confident vocal accompaniment, ably supported by her parents N. Narayan (mridanga), and Shanti Narayan (violin). Nattuvangam support by Rhadha\u2019s disciples Sangita Vasudevan and Vidya Balan was truly remarkable. Samyuktha Narayan, also a disciple of Rhadha, was an outstanding emcee for the programme. It was a pleasure to see all three disciples beaming with pride and joy, on seeing their teacher\u2019s ecstatic dancing.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Sankritilaya deserves all the credit for sponsoring Rhadha\u2019s first Bay Area appearance. We hope to see Rhadha again and again.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
