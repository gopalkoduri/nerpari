Then it must be some pseudo highbrow stuff.\u201d This was the remark an ardent supporter of music and drama made, when invited to watch an English play last year. It turned out he had never seen a single play by one of the oldest amateur theatrical groups in India. His view was based on his impressions made through hearsay back in his schooldays, when the Players had inherited the props and make-up box left behind by The Madras Dramatic Society\u2014whose members were expatriates working for the British Council.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Some of the young men and women to have been seduced by the lure of theatre and included in the cast of those early productions are still around\u2014and still contributing to the Madras Players, which celebrated its golden jubilee with <i>Nagamandala</i> in 2004.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The man who wrote the play, Girish Karnad, now an internationally known playwright and actor, was a young member of the Madras Players in the sixties. Bhagirathi Narayanan, who directed the jubilee production of Nagamandala, months before her death on stage in April 2005, had been with the group since 1969. N.S. Yamuna, Vishalam Ekambaram, Grace Krishnaswamy, Ravi Baskaran, Gopi Nair, P.C. Ramakrishna, S. Ramachander, Mohamed Yusuf, Mithran Devanesen, A.V. Dhanushkodi... the list of the Madras Players veterans, still associated with the group in varying degrees of involvement on or behind the stage or as devoted supporters in front of it, is long and impressive. And their long journey with the troupe has been one of amateur passion for theatre, and the several stops on the way have been varied and inclusive. From Ibsen and Shakespeare, Shaw and Rattigan, Mohan Rakesh and Badal Sircar, down to home-grown talent from Chetan Shah and Poilie Sengupta to Anupama Chandrasekhar and Anushka Ravishankar, the range of playwrights has been far too egalitarian in its sweep to be dismissed airily as pseudo high brow. Through the decades, the Madras Players\u2019 contribution to worthwhile theatre in Chennai has been as significant and sincere as the best that the few surviving serious Tamil groups have offered.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Some of the founding members of the Players are no more with us. Snehalata Reddy, later to become a victim of the Emergency, and her husband Pattabhirama Reddy did great work in cinema as well, Pattabhi\u2019s Samskara, based on U.R. Ananthamurthi\u2019s novel going on to win national and international awards. V. Gopalakrishnan was a successful character actor in films. Ammu Mathew, president of the group from the 1960s to her death in 1984, also directed some of the most powerful plays of the period, including Badal Sircar\u2019s <i>Evam Indrajit,</i> Tendulkar\u2019s <i>Shantata Court Chalu Ahe</i> <i>and Sakharam Binder, Tiger, Tiger,</i> based on Bhagwan Gidwani\u2019s <i>Sword of Tipu Sultan,</i> and Mohan Rakesh\u2019s <i>Aadhey Adhurey.</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />In his tribute to 50 years of the Madras Players, <i>Bring down the House Lights,</i> P.C. Ramakrishna describes Ammu Mathew as the Queen Bee. According to him, she \u2018had the sultry Kerala good looks\u2014olive skinned, tall, stately, smoky eyed.\u2019 He calls Lakshmi and S.V. Krishnamurty the First Couple of the Madras Players. They were \u2018the links between the founders... like Snehalata Reddy, and the \u2018newcomers\u2019 like Ramakrishna and Co. \u2018Today, they have settled down in Bangalore, but none of us who knew them and their wonderful hospitality can ever forget the great times that were had at 18, Pycrofts Garden\u2019, the couple\u2019s Madras home. To the couple, theatre was their life breath. Both were outstanding, demanding directors and superb actors. Lakshmi\u2019s role in Samskara was unforgettable.\u2019</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Come on, Tiger, you\u2019ve got to be heard by the deaf old lady in the last row!\u2019 This is the opening line of the chapter, <i>The Decade of the Tiger</i> on the late Vimal Bhagat. \u2018Anybody who has had anything to do with the Madras Players in the \u201870s and \u201880s will remember this familiar roar, as a co-actor was admonished at rehearsal\u2019, Ramakrishna continues. \u2018It was a compelling voice, the voice of authority\u2019.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Bhagat was a strong presence in Madras theatre for over a decade, doing some memorable roles in \u2018Poor Murderer; <i>\u2018Who\u2019s afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u2019</i> and <i>\u2018A View from the Bridge,\u2019</i> for example. Bhagat also played another important role\u2014of taking the group\u2019s plays to Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Calcutta, and making theatre commercially viable while doing so.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />An endearing character from the 1970s theatre scene of Madras, Ambi Harsha, is now a US citizen. \u2018Everything about him was long. He had a long face, a long nose, a long frame, long legs, and the longest thumb I\u2019ve ever seen (I should know, for he accidentally poked me in the eye with it, gesticulating frenetically at rehearsal),\u2019 Ramakrishna remembers this \u2018permanent fixture\u2019 of Madras Players productions of the seventies for his \u2018unique brand of comedy, full of facial tics and windmill gestures\u2019, and his \u2018stilted kind of English on stage, which seemed to go with his personality.\u2019 Anybody who knew Ambi in his Madras Christian College days, his wacky sense of humour, his passion for cricket and his stint as radio and TV commentator, will know exactly what PC means.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Of Casanovas and teddy bears</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Ronnie Patel, whom P.C. Ramakrishna calls Casanova-70\u2014obviously for obvious reasons\u2014Mohamed Yusuf, \u2018the Great Big Teddy Bear,\u2019 again obvious to anyone who has met Yusuf, and Mithran Devanesen, the \u2018Don of Design\u2019 are some of the other pillars of the Players remembered in this warm and delightful jubilee book.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018Mithran began his theatre career under Ammu Mathew (who didn\u2019t?) by initially sweeping the stage for her productions,\u2019 worked on the technical side of all Ammu\u2019s productions, picking up the dynamics of theatre along the way, and played a few roles, if reluctantly, starring in Shaw\u2019s <i>Androcles and the Lion. In Tiger, Tiger,</i> he was Maqbool Khan, the rapist, but gradually shifted to design and production. Ramakrishna thinks Mithran\u2019s work as a set designer was outstanding in <i>Dance Like a Man, Mangalam and Mercy,</i> treating three widely different backgrounds with expertise\u2014one the ancestral home of a dancing couple in Bangalore, full of period furniture and artefacts, another a lower middle class agraharam home in Kumbakonam and the third a comatose woman\u2019s music room with her husband the sole character. The last was the first solo performance (P.C. Ramakrishna) in English in Chennai.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Salim Ghouse is another actor from the seventies, a powerful practitioner of method acting. Ramakrishna calls him Madras\u2019s Marlon Brando, brooding, solitary, fiercely introspective. This is what he says about Salim, who went on to become a well known name in Mumbai theatre, and Hindi and Tamil cinema (though many will also remember him as Bharat Sinha in a TV serial based on Sivasankari\u2019s novel and as Krishna in Shyam Benegal\u2019s <i>Bharat Ek Khoj</i>):</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u2018He finishes a scene with me, and exits. I have a bit more to do before my own exit. As I walk into the wings, I find friend Salim wrapped around a pillar crying copiously, with the crew cluck-clucking in chorus about him. Imagine our utter surprise, when he announces between heaving sobs, \u2018Yaar...I was so good...I was so good...!\u2019 Salim Ghouse is a brilliant actor and a passionate theatreperson, but we all know that this particular scene is typical of Salim, the man.\u2019</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Ramakrishna\u2019s book lists all the plays performed by the Madras Players in the last five decades. What an impressive list that is! Every major playwright figures in the list: William Shakespeare, George Bernard Shaw, Terence Rattigan, Peter Shaffer, John Osborne, Edward Albee, Harold Pinter, Luigi Pirandello, Tennessee Williams, Neil Simon, Vijay Tendulkar, Mahesh Elkunchwar, Mahesh Dattani, Gurcharan Das, Timeri Murari... who hasn\u2019t been performed? Every kind of play from the theatre of the absurd to merely absurd theatre is represented in this vast repertoire. True, there have been some plays that fit the description of \u2018pseudo high brow,\u2019 but it would be grossly unfair to label so the impressive body of work the group has attempted with devotion over the decades.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Particular mention must be made of the young or first time playwrights the Madras Players has featured in the recent past: Sreekumar Varma, Sabitha Radhakrishna, Sunipa Basu, Anupama Chandrasekhar, Harsha Dandapani, Krupasagar Sridharan, Reshma Nichani, Poilie Sengupta, Anushka Ravishankar, KR Usha, Chetan Shah, Mohan Narayanan and Gowri Ramnarayan are among the talents showcased by Madras Players, some of them before they became well known names. This year, the Players presented its first full-length musical, <i>Rural Phantasy,</i> a huge risk that paid off.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The Madras Players, like every other institution, is a product of the times. Ramakrishna says in the introduction to his book that it \u2018will continue to be the \u2018grand old lady\u2019 of theatre in Madras, looking on with a benign eye, as the young Turks take energetic steps forward, pushing at the boundaries of new discovery.\u2019 He refers to the restructuring taking place with people like T.T. Srinath, Ejji, Shankar Sundaram, Rajiv Choudhry, and Kaveri Lalchand contributing their own impetus to the group\u2019s committee, and others like Chidambaram, Y.G. Rajendra, Bharat Raman and S. Ramachander also joining in. To a disinterested observer, it is also apparent from recent productions that the grand old lady is trying to merge with current trends, not all of them welcome. Much of today\u2019s theatre is no more\u2019 than mere fluff, and it will be its old supporters\u2019 hope that the Madras Players will continue to be the grand old lady.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
