The composition chosen for the workshop was the Sankarabharanam pada varnam <i>Saamiki</i> <i>sari evvare,</i> a dance composition of Panchapakesa Nattuvanar. This was an opportunity for ABHAI to commemorate the 125th anniversary of natyacharya T. Kuppiah Pillai (1887-1981). Kuppiah Pillai\u2019s son, Natya Kalanidhi T.K. Kalyanasundaram of Sri Rajarajeswari Bharatanatya Kala Mandir, Mumbai, taught the composition between 6 and 15 May 2013. At the foyer of the Narada Gana Sabha, every morning it was a joyous experience watching, learning and experiencing the pada varnam as it was opened layer by layer by an experienced teacher. The result was sheer magic.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />We witnessed the acharya parampara in Kalayanasundaram Pillai over several sessions \u2013 humble while speaking on &nbsp;worldly affairs, and detached about mundane matters, and growing larger than life when it came to matters of art. He punctuated the classes every now and then with stories both religious and secular, humorous anecdotes, and most important, drops of nectar &nbsp;of philosophy. Constant encouragement and assurance that the participants were faring well made confidence soar high among the learners, perhaps a teaching technique of a master teacher. By marvelling at the varnam being completed within the stipulated timeframe, he gave the participants a sense of happiness that they were learning a legendary composition in a short time, completely aware that it would take &nbsp;months of continuous practice to master it.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />His patience while teaching and his willingness to repeat the same instruction umpteen times was admirable and a lesson to any young teacher. He did the nattuvangam with &nbsp;restraint and control, coupled with excellent rendition of Sankarabharanam. Phrases of &nbsp;rare quality reflecting the mood and content of the sancharis were sung. It showed &nbsp;great emphasis laid on music and highlighted the fact that dance is visual music. We also understood that singing for dance is not an easy matter; it needs separate grooming, receptiveness and sensitivity.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The teermanams were like beautiful &nbsp;flowers strung together, starting from the samam, ending in an eduppu filled with complexities wherever required, as a piece of embellishment, and ending with simple arudis. Complete adavus, insistence on good araimandi, muzhumandi, and angasuddham, and constant instruction that abhinaya should be subtle, suggestive and crisp, reflected the &nbsp;wisdom &nbsp;the acharya has practised and taught. the emphasis on avoiding eye contact with the onlookers, was a revelation \u2013 showing a refined and suggestive way of demonstrating the bhava. The high integrity of the natyacharya was evident during the entire duration of training.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Kalyanasundaram is living proof &nbsp;of the reverence the word \u2018Swami\u2019 would hold in his world of art and life. His emphasis on the firmness in holding the sikhara hasta and curtailing unwanted emotions, doing the attami while addressing the lord was a demonstration of his life ethics.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The pallavi <i>\u2018Saamiki sari evvare\u2019</i> unfolds with the idea that there is no one equal to the Lord. The Sethupati lords were great patrons of arts and literature who were described as \u2018sangeeta vidya sahitya vinodan\u2019. The dance composer had chosen to interpret it to mean that there is no one to equal his musical skills, bravery and knowledge of the sastras.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />In the second kandigai of the pallavi which says, \u201cO friend I cannot bear this separation,\u201d the acharya explained in depth and also demonstrated with finesse the abhinaya of a viraha nayika. The gestures were &nbsp;subtle, simple, straightforward and uncluttered as in any dance composition of yore, with emphasis on mukhaja abhinaya.</span></div>\u000a<br />\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2APXnr6JtIM/UgXy6dLxG0I/AAAAAAAADqw/f8owqQwAO04/s1600/DSCF2564.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2APXnr6JtIM/UgXy6dLxG0I/AAAAAAAADqw/f8owqQwAO04/s320/DSCF2564.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The highlight came in the anupallavi \u2013 first kandigai, <i>\u2018Bhoomilo Bhaskarendra Setupati bhoopaludu\u2019</i> which literally means, on earth Bhaskarendra Sethupati is Bhoopala. The dance composer had taken full advantage of the phrase to show the prowess of Raja Bhaskara Setupati in iyal, isai and natakam. We were taught a sanchari depicting a poet composing in the hall of connoisseurs and being endowed with gifts. While explaining this kai the acharya pointed out many finer points which would have eluded us \u2013 the poem sung in praise of the king in the court has to be written facing the king in the tradition of singing aasukavi. The poet nust not bend way down while handing over the manuscript because he &nbsp;and the king are of equal stature in an assembly of learned men. The king, on his part, bends forward and receives the poem with reverence, reads it, worships the lyrics, as it is not just a paean to him but to his entire royal lineage. He places the manuscript aside, honours the poet and bows down to his prowess. This idea was explained in length, an amazingly different understanding of the way in which scholarship was received and acknowledged by royalty in those days.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The natyacharya also explained the respect given to musicians by the kings. This he incorporated into the sancharis. He pointed out that we must show the Maharaja appreciating with royal restraint so as not to disturb the artist, an interesting nuance. <br /><br />The adavus set for the chittaswaram and the ettugada swaras were so musical. The last ettugada swara or the makuta charanaswara was composed as a beautiful chain of nritta sequences with mei adavus, korvais punctuated with excellent finales.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />T.K. Kalyanasundaram was assisted by his wife K. Mythili, a performer of yesteryear and a teacher who also hails from a traditional family of artists. The acharya's granddaughter, Shruti served as a monitor for the class.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The workshop was a progressive step. Young dancers rarely have the opportunity &nbsp;to interact, learn and imbibe from traditional teachers and performers, for their number is fast dwindling. A true gem &nbsp;radiates light and vanquishes darkness \u2013 so does the Guru.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
