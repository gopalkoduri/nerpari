To arrive at a list of ragas and compositions to fulfil this challenge can be daunting indeed. But Prasanna Venkataraman transformed musician Savita Narasimhan\u2019s elegant home into a dense forest of many lights and colours. The vigour and vitality of the team (Prasanna, Shertalai Sivakumar and Poongulam Subramanian) turned the performance into a cracker of a concert.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aOpening with the relatively sedate piece <i><b>Minakshi me mudam dehi</b></i> without allowing the pace to sag was truly admirable. Niraval at the aptly chosen line, <i>\u2018Minalochani pasamochani manini <b>kadamba vana vasini</b>\u2019</i> had not only bhava-soaked prayogas, but the unique fragrance of Purvikalyani (Gamakakriya, in the Dikshitar school), and the kadamba flower.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aPrasanna\u2019s Saveri alapana and niraval at <b><i>Nipa vana nilaye</i></b> (from <b><i>Sripatimukha</i></b>) were prolific like the dense foliage of a neem forest (<i>Nipa vanam</i>). This rare Syama Sastri kriti came like a breath of fresh air and Sherthalai Sivakumar\u2019s accompaniment was fitting. Prasanna balanced the <i>kalapramana</i> of the concert with a quick Dikshitar kriti <i><b>Sarasa sauvira rasanadi,</b></i> in the raga Sauvira, which ended all too quickly before the audience could bat an eyelid and react to the contours of this hardly-before-heard raga. This composition is based on the kshetra \u2018Pushpavanam\u2019 near Madurai, and refers to <b><i>Pushpavana-adhipate.</i></b> (How lovely to imagine a forest of flowers in today\u2019s drab world!) near Madurai.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThen came the <i>piece de resistance.</i> By then Prasanna was in his element<span style="font-family: &quot;Book Antiqua&quot;; font-size: 12pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;">\u2014</span>imagination unfettered and voice uninhibited \u2013 and his Kambhoji was a class apart. Apart from the grandeur and depth that we have commonly come to associate with Kambhoji, there was a certain mood of revelry in Prasanna\u2019s handling of the raga, suggestive of the composition to follow. Sivakumar\u2019s apt replies to Prasanna\u2019s <i>alapana</i> and <i>kalpanasvaras</i> added gusto to the concert. A brief but beautifully rendered <b><i>Sayankale vanante,</i></b> the much loved <i>shloka</i> from Sri Krishna Karnamrtam by Leela Suka, describing Krishna and the gopis in the twilight woods as flowers bloom under the moonlight, was a fitting prelude to Swati Tirunal\u2019s <b><i>Rasa vilasa.</i></b> This kriti from the KVN repertory, seems to have gone out of the concert circuit. Prasanna\u2019s choice to sing this composition could not have been more pertinent, as it describes the merrymaking of Krishna and the gopikas of Brindavanam and the ecstasy of <i>rasa-krida,</i> actualised with a vibrant jati and svara. These dancing rhythms emerged so evocatively in Poongulam Subramaniam\u2019s playful fingers, that the quick <i>tani</i> spurt did not seem short at all, but the conclusion of a full-fledged presentation.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aForests have been spiritual centres in several ancient civilizations. The forest has also been employed as a spiritual metaphor for inner conflict and dilemma as seen in Subramanya Bharati\u2019s <b><i>Dikku teriyada kaattil</i></b> which came next. The folk motif was included in with the description of the mountain forest from <i>Kutrala Kuravanji</i> in Huseni, while a dvi-raga viruttam (<b><i>Ponnar meniyane</i></b>) became the quiet finale.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aOne wished that the <i>sahitya,</i> particularly in viruttham and tukkada, were sung more discernibly, and with a greater accent on the <i>sahitya bhava,</i> so that listeners could enjoy them even more. And Prasanna\u2019s voice needs more power and clarity in the <i>mandara,</i> and more layering in the <i>tara</i> registers.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aBut these are easily remediable matters. What Prasanna proved on that day was that he knew that a keen sense of proportion goes a long way in ensuring the success of a Carnatic music concert. He maintained a fine balance of <i>kalpita</i> and <i>manodharma</i> <i>sangitam</i> which clearly showed his maturity as a performer. His improvisations matched the structure and mood of the composition to which they were aligned. Now and then, he was able to make listeners sit up with the unusual and the unexpected. And yet, though his imagination ranged free, it never went berserk. Most importantly, while the format of this performance had its own progression, it was not tangibly fragmented into opener, \u201csub-main\u201d and \u201cmain\u201d. This brought wholesomeness to the concert, commanded the same level of attentiveness in listeners and gave them a sense of immense satisfaction.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b>THE CONCERT</b></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aMinakshi me mudam dehi \u2013 Gamakakriya \u2013 Adi \u2013 Muttuswami Dikshitar<br />\u000aSripatimukha virachita \u2013 Saveri \u2013 Adi \u2013 Syama Sastri<br />\u000aSarasa sauvira \u2013 Sauviram \u2013 Adi \u2013 Mutuswami Dikshitar<br />\u000aSayankale vanante (Shloka)<br />\u000aRasa vilasa \u2013 Kambhoji \u2013 Adi \u2013 Swati Tirunal<br />\u000aKuttrala kuravanji \u2013 Huseni \u2013 Misra Chapu<br />\u000aPonnar meniyane (Viruttam) \u2013 Simhendramadhyamam &amp; Surati</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b>THE ARTISTES</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dITHboNFCMc/T7YvtLcdlNI/AAAAAAAAAgw/32tW_WiQbBg/s1600/DSCN2390.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240px" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dITHboNFCMc/T7YvtLcdlNI/AAAAAAAAAgw/32tW_WiQbBg/s320/DSCN2390.JPG" width="320px" /></a></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b>PRASANNA VENKATRAMAN</b> (vocal) has been groomed by veteran musicians such Smt T R Balamani and Sri T K Govinda Rao.

Could Vyasa or Valmiki have ever given voice to their vision if they had not dwelt in the forests?</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><b>Vanam hi rakshyate vyaaghrair vyaaghraanrakshati kaananam\u2026</b></i></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe Mahabharata has the wise Vidura advise the exiled Pandavas to bond with the same inseparable, mutually protective synergy as the tiger and the forest.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aModern research has proved forests indispensable to life on earth. Medical research warns of nature-deficit diseases affecting people living in treeless concrete jungles. What scientists, environmentalists and animal welfare activists demand today are values painted in prehistoric caves, resounding in Vedic hymns, carved on temple walls, imaged in poetry.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aWhether Kalidasa natakam or Kuravanji koothu, our poets tirelessly describe many forests, each with its own species of trees, flowers, fruits, medicinal plants, animals, birds\u2026They believe that wilderness is dear to the gods, the matrix of spiritual power\u2026 nature renewing creativity. When Carnatic composers sing of Siva in Badarivanam, Minakshi in <b><i>Kadambavanam</i></b> and Krishna in <b><i>Brindavanam,</i></b> don\u2019t they see the forests as the centres of this soul force?</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i><b>Dikku teriyada kaattil unnai tedi tedi ilaittene\u2026</b></i></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aYes, the forest can also be a misleading maze. But what is lost can be found. Walking through a <b><i>kondrai vanam </i></b>(laburnum wood) saint Sundarar (8th century) heard the cry, <b><i>\u201cSundaram, ennai marandayo? Have you forgotten me?\u201d</i></b> Rushing to find its source he came upon a lingam in a dilapidated temple, spotlit by a sunbeam, in a shower of golden flowers.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b><i>Ponnar meniyane\u2026milir kondrai anindavane\u2026</i></b></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSundarar found his gold. And he has left it for us in his exquisite song. As have the other visionary composers whose voices we shall hear today. They knew that the <b><i>vanam</i></b> is vital to our survival in life here, and hereafter.</div></div>
