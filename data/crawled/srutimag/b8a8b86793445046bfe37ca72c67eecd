Held at the Narada Gana Sabha Mini Hall, it attracted many a Hindustani rasika and Meeta Pandit did not disappoint them. The concert was dedicated to the memory of Pandit Ravishankar, the late sitar maestro.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Madhuvanti was the raga that Meeta sang in the beginning, but she went on to provide a rich fare of khayal in Tilak Kamod, a thumri in Misra Pilu and a moving Bhairavi to close.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Meeta is a granddaughter and disciple of Pt. Krishna Rao Shankar and the daughter of the legendary Pt. Lakshman Krishna Rao.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />In the raag Madhuvanti, the opening vilambit in Ektal \u201cAb to suniye araj hamariya\u2019 showed the power of Meeta\u2019s voice. Dhrut in teen taal followed \u2013 \u2018Unse mori lagan laagire\u2019 was an enchanting rendition. The third component of Madhuvanti was a romantic piece.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The khayal in japtaal for the lyric \u2018Teerath ka sab kare\u2019 and the subsequent dhrut in teen taal for the line \u2018Neer bharana kaise jaavun sakhi ab\u2019 were scintillating. The thumri was another lilting song in Misra Pilu. The well known Bhavani dayani rendered at the close enthralled the audience.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Harmonium accompaniment by Vyasmurti Katti and tabla by Vishwanath Nakod contributed to the success of the concert.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />An awardee of Sangeet Natak Akademi\u2019s Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar, Indira Gandhi Priyadarshini Award, Golden Voice of India, Sur-mani, Yuva Ratna, Delhi Ratna and FICCI award in the field of music, Meeta Pandit in her opening remarks said she was proud to present her maiden performance in Chennai. Both <i>India Today</i> and the <i>Week</i>.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Have hailed her as a representative of youth power. Music Today, SaReGaMa, and EMI Virgin have released her albums. Meeta presented a music appreciation series \u2018Swar Shringar\u2019 on World Space Satellite Radio. She is now a Consultant with the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Meeta Pandit has taken part in prestigious festivals outside India, in France, Germany, U.K., Switzerland, Norway, Rome, U.S.A, Canada, Russia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal.
