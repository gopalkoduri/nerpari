At the \u2018mehendi-sangeet\u2019 ceremony preceding the wedding of a friend\u2019s daughter, a small stage was put up in the corner of a tastefully decorated garden of the bungalow. VVS Manian\u2019s Konnakol show, accompanied by Nellai Balaji on the mridangam and H. Sivaramakrishnan on the ghatam took us on a gala tala trip. Tirukkural and Avvaiyar\u2019s Aathi Choodi provided variety in nadai and talam to add value as well as pep to the presentation. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Manian teaches at PSBB schools, and with the help of Mrs YGP, has been taking his show to many other schools. Manian aims to revive the art form by impressing upon young minds the infinite variety that our classical art offers.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">A solo Bharatanatyam presentation of Meenakshi Kalyanam followed. Vidya Deepak, dressed in a simple sari, with minimal make up and accessories, mimed to the poetry written by her father Ramanathan, recited by her sister Kalyani Venkatesh. She beautifully brought out all the nuances in her facial abhinaya and light body movements \u2013 commanding everyone\u2019s attention in its directness and simplicity. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">An evening well spent, savouring beautiful art away from the mainstream.</div></div>
