Srinivas had a mellifluous base voice, soft and staid but capable of subtle inflections (savour the \u2018malligai\u2019 in the later career-making hit, \u2018Kaalangalil Aval Vasantham\u2019, which sails so softly along G-R-S- R - G - R- S, like a closely woven string of jasmine buds. The king of Carnatic music in films, G. Ramanathan more than understood this aspect of the singer\u2019s art and gave him some dainty songs. \u2018Inbam pongum vennila\u2019 in which the clarinet and strings shimmer with Srinivas and Sushila in Veerapandiya Kattabomman, \u2018Kaniyo pago karkando\u2019 in which Srinivas and <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_06.html" target="_blank">MLV</a> played melodic mesmers and of course the Subramanya Bharati winner in Kappaloattiya Thamizhan, Kaatruveliyidai Kannamma (which starts off from Mohanam and woos the suddha madhyamam and kakali nishadam in winning romantic strains). M.B. Srinivasan came up with a winsome melody from the Harikambhoji scale in the communist-powered debacle, <i>Paadhai Theriyidhu Paar,</i> pitching Srinivas and S. Janaki to a bewitching melody based on Gnanpeeth winner Jayakanthan\u2019s rare lyric, <i>Thennankeetru oonjalile.</i> We may no more be able to witness the sparrow cradling on the coconut frond, but here is one ditty that will rock melody lovers for all time to time. Adi Narayana Rao, known for his predilection for the Hindusthani idiom, came up with winsome light melodies in Adhutha Veettu Penn, a storyline that came to Tamil from the original Bengali (Paasher Baadi) through Telugu (Pakkinti Ammaai). But none of all this made much difference to the singer\u2019s career! Not until \u2018Kaalangalil Aval Vasantham\u2019 (Paava Mannippu), with its awesome pauses and lovely interludes on the harmonica, and an unforgettable lyric (Kannadasan taking off from Krishna\u2019s assertion in the Gita that he is Margazhi among the months and concluding it with the reason for the hero\u2019s enthusiastic song \u2013 \u2018She has made me a poet\u2019!). The song rode on the wings of a success and a musical wave of a new \u2018light music\u2019 and made a hundred flowers bloom for PBS.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
