V<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><b>By MV Swaroop</b></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aEvery now and then, at a concert, you sense that a musician has broken a barrier, that an irksome block between idea and expression has been removed, that creativity is available in a bottomless glass, and the music flows with great vivacity and freedom. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">This happened to Tiruvarur Girish yesterday at Laya Madhuraa when he hit Varali\u2019s stirring <i>ga</i> in the mandra sthayi, his voice strong, clear and heavy. A middling concert unexpectedly acquired deep meaning. The audience, restive until then, were arrested. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3e6VrTgbM4/TtitM0JkFSI/AAAAAAAAAGE/e18eE4hlzCo/s1600/Photo0058.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-W3e6VrTgbM4/TtitM0JkFSI/AAAAAAAAAGE/e18eE4hlzCo/s320/Photo0058.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">The raga alapana set up a mood perfect for Tyagaraja\u2019s lament, <i>Eti janmamidi ha,</i> where the bard asks, \u201cWhat sort of a life is this, Rama, where I cannot see you and talk to you at every turn?\u201d T.K. Murthy\u2019s mridangam punctuated these questions with a profound sort of majesty, as Girish unleashed sangati after sangati of flowing Varali in the niraval. At the end of the swaraprastara, Murthy instinctively launched into a tani avartanam, but was stopped by Girish, who said, <i>\u201cOru Sankarabharanam paadi vidatumaa?\u201d</i><br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">When the tani came, at the end of a ponderous <i>Emi neramu</i> in Sankarabharanam, Murthy, only 87, was in his element, weaving beguiling patterns of fours and eights into complicated cycles of rhythm. Tiravarur Bhaktavatsalam, sitting at the master\u2019s feet, kept talam in awe as Murthy reduced him (and most of the audience) to tears with his sorcery. Once, in the middle, he slipped, and laughed, and said, \u201cI\u2019m growing old, no? I forget everything!\u201d B. Sivaraman, supporting him on the mridangam, finished the kanakku, drawing an enthusiastic round of \u201cSabhash!\u201d from the audience.<br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">What I loved most about Girish\u2019s concert came after the tani. The tukkada-s weren\u2019t \u201clight\u201d or \u2018popular\u2019. He sang the most sumptuous Mukhari alapana, and started the padam <i>Ososi</i>. When he took a long rest at <i>namadi,</i> Nagai Muralidharan\u2019s purring violin, the stillness of the tara sthayi <i>ri,</i> that aching purity of sound, and the resounding silence of the mridangam, stopped hearts. Murthy\u2019s mridangam came in whispers through the song \u2013 he didn\u2019t strike it or beat it, he petted it \u2013 moving even the three cantankerous children in the hall to complete silence. <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">The Khamas that followed, <i>Jaanaro,</i> was a testament to Girish\u2019s lineage, with the kakali and kaisiki nishada-s competing for attention in a flood of delicate phrases. It was the vibrant yin to the Mukhari\u2019s serene yang. My teacher turned to me a couple of times, as if to ask, \u201cHeard that?\u201d <br />\u000a&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: center;">* * *</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Earlier in the evening, N. Ramani added \u201cMadhura Kala Bhushana\u201d to his infinite list of titles. In an intimate speech, his close friend, Cleveland Sundaram said something that brought a smile to my face, \u201cMy sons are his students, and I am telling you... You should see how his students get along with him. They are like his best friends, almost.\u201d That is exactly what it is like to be around Sir. He is an extraordinary musician, a legend, and a name Carnatic music will not forget. But he is so affable, he puts you at such ease, that you have to constantly tell yourself this fact to remember it.</div></div>
