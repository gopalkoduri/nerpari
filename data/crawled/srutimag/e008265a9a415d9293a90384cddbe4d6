Ganeshkumar has received many awards and titles such as the \u201cMaharashtra Abhangaratna\u201d. He has also had the rare opportunity of singing in the sanctum sanctorum of the Vithala temple in Pandharpur.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ganesh Kumar began his gripping oration by saying that Maharashtra was the birthplace of the Bhakti cult in India. Many great saints like Namdev and Tukaram have praised Lord Vithala in the common man\u2019s language, a speciality of the bhakti saints.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">This renowned tradition started with Adi Sankara\u2019s Pandurangashtakam. During this time, the varna system underwent a total collapse caused by the tyrannical behaviour of the upper class. What ensued from this degeneration was the birth of the bhakti movement.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">After Adi Sankara came a young and brilliant scholar - Gyaneswar. The starting of the Bhakti Movement in Maharashtra is sometimes attributed to him. Some say that nam sankirtan, or the repeated chanting of the name of the lord, too began at the time of Sant Gyaneswar. The nam sankirtan sampradaya is one that is based on bhakti which in turn is a manifestation of bhava, Ganesh Kumar emphasized. This rich tradition all began with the simple recitation of <i>Jaya Jaya Rama Krishna Hari.</i> After briefing the audience on the story of Gyaneswar, Ganesh Kumar went on to speak of the famous abhangasaints - Namdev, Choka Mela, Eknath and Tukaram. (As a member of the audience my only background of these saints was from Amar Chitra Katha). Ganesh Kumar gave a rich historical and spiritual context to our understanding of this period.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The content of their abhangas he said was based primarily on the philosophy of advaita. Advaitic concepts were made simple and the common man was able to connect with this idea of \u2018oneness\u2019. It was advaitic philosophy with love for Isvara. Ganesh Kumar also defined the abhangas as \u201ca composition sung by a saint as an outpouring in praise of almighty God.\u201d He also defined a saint as the embodiment of daya or compassion. A person is recognized\u2014not by an institution or a government, but by the masses\u2014 as a saint, one who shows boundless compassion. Only a song written by these mahatmas can be considered an abhang.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Eknath mainly sang the Bharud type of Abhang, often meant for the plebeian. They could be outpourings of a person\u2019s problems, like those of a daughter-in-law with her troublesome mother-in-law.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">When Krishnadeva Raya came to Pandharpur, he was appalled at the quality of worship sans achara that Vithala was receiving. At once he arranged for the transfer of the idol to Halebid, his capital city. The story of Sant Bhanudas brought the idol nback to Pandharpur and the Vithala temple in Halebidu with no Vithala idol are still part of abhanga lore.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Vasudev sang very simple songs that even a child could understand. The comical costumes he wore would evoke laughter from the children who would gather to listen.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Abhangas of the dhruvapada tradition, the precursor of Dhrupad in classical music, were meant to be sung by a group, just like a choir. These compositions were designed to suit both male and female voices as well as voices of the old and the young.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The main deities of focus in abhangas are Rama, Ganesa, Dattatreya and of course, Panduranga of Pandharpur. In the Varkari sampradaya, there is no caste discrimination regarding who can participate and who cannot. Everyone is welcome to join in.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The accompaniment for group singing consists mainly of the cymbals (which everyone carries), mridanga, bansuri, harmonium and violin. The ragas chosen are always simple. Some of these ragas are Bhoop, Patdeep, Poorya Dhanashri and Bhatiyar.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Ganesh Kumar gave an emotional description of the way simple folk walked hundreds of miles singing their praise of the lord on their way to Pandharpur. He extolled the beauty of the simplicity of this great tradition that connects all mankind, regardless of a person\u2019s station in society.</span></div>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
