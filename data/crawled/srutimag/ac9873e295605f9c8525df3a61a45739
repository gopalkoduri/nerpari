Neela Mami was singing a beautiful \u2018Neelotpalanayike\u2019 in Kannadagoula, when she quietly mentioned that she was born \u2018Neelotopalambal\u2019. No surprise then, that Mami\u2019s music is so divine and spiritual.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Born in an orthodox Tamil Iyer household in Kumbakonam, Mami is candid as she narrates the fascinating and engrossing story of her childhood. She is as comfortable talking about her orthodox upbringing in Kumbakonam, as her post-marriage life in bustling Bangalore. Bangalore and Kumbakonam may be at opposite ends of the spectrum, but Mami loves both\u2014she has made both places her own.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Mami fondly recalls how she began her music lessons with Nedundheru Sadagopacharya, who taught her the sarali and janta varisais, alankarams and other basic lessons. Though passionate enough about listening to music to surreptitiously sneak out of the house, against her father\u2019s wishes, to attend concerts of great musicians at Kumbakonam, she never trained to become a professional musician.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">She however, learnt many kritis taught to the girls in the house, primarily with the objective of singing before a prospective groom\u2019s family. Interestingly, Neela Mami\u2019s husband, Ramgopal Mama remembers he was stunned when he heard the young Neela sing <i>Vasudevayani</i> in front of him and his parents when they went to \u201csee her.\u201d</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Neela Mami\u2019s intensive musical training began only at 23 \u2013 an age at which many current musicians already have many performances to their credit. Undeterred by the delayed start, Neela Mami persevered to improve her musical prowess in a journey that reflects unflinching determination, infectious energy, and a strong will to bounce back after any number of setbacks. She has successfully overcome roadblocks in her musical career and several chronic health problems\u2014including a brain hemorrhage and cancer. Mami\u2019s journey of unflinching resolve continues to inspire and awe.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><b><i>Karubaru Seyuvaru</i></b></div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">At the age of 23, Mami began her training under critic, connoisseur and musician NM Narayanan. Interestingly enough, the first composition she learnt was <i>Tyagaraja\u2019s</i> masterpiece in Mukhari, <i>Karubaru Seyuvaru.</i> To learn such a sophisticated composition as your first must have been a daunting task, but Mami recalls lapping it up eagerly and quickly. While teaching me this kriti, she painstakingly explained to me every single nuance in the pallavi, how to contrast the power of the \u2018karu\u2019 with the mellow, gentle caress of \u2018baru\u2019, how to link the last word of the line \u2018seyuvaru\u2019 with the next <i>sangati</i> of \u2018karu\u2019, how to prolong the \u2018karubaru\u2019 with a long karvai after the last sangati of the pallavi, a musical learning I will never forget. Such <i>\u2018sookshmangal\u2019</i> make Mami\u2019s music so beautiful and soulful.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><b><i>Valaputala vasama</i></b></div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">This is one class that will remain very special in my memory. It was after a concert in Chennai where someone had requested Mami to sing a padam, and she immediately obliged with Swati Tirunal\u2019s evocative <i>Valaputala vasama</i> in Athana. The day after she came back to Bangalore, Mami began teaching me this stunning song. The way she taught it was different from how she would teach a kriti such as a Sri Krishnam bhaja manasa, for instance. She handled the padam delicately, like a flower \u2013 and yet, full of <i>azhuttam.</i> Mami told me, this is the purest of the pure ghee, even one drop of anything else will make the ghee impure; you have to struggle to learn it.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">The way Mami sang this padam was incredible \u2013 I remember telling Mami that I did not want to sing it after she did, for I did not want to change the mood she had created \u2013 it was electric, and captivating.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">The way she sang with <i>odukkal-sedukkal\u2019</i> (the musical improvisation of gently pushing and pulling the word from its place in the song within the rhythmic framework of the talam), the way she sensitively sang the <i>\u2018dp-dp\u2019</i> notes of Athana, the way she oscillated each note and linked each line to the next \u2013 the effect was beautiful and blissful.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><b>Guru Neela Ramgopal</b></div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0rw5FeMiok8/T3BM7JfdWHI/AAAAAAAAAa8/0exFBmg6NFw/s1600/DEC_0409.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0rw5FeMiok8/T3BM7JfdWHI/AAAAAAAAAa8/0exFBmg6NFw/s320/DEC_0409.JPG" width="214" /></a></div>Mami believes in the values of chaste classicism and tradition. She follows a rich <i>pathantaram</i> acquired from authentic sources, and is uncompromising while teaching kritis \u2013 if a single sangathi is missed out, Mami would immediately reprimand, to sing it several times so that it is never forgotten in the future! Her <i>paathantharam</i> and teaching methodology and singing kritis is so beautiful that several eminent musicians have remarked, \u2018What a solid and strong <i>vazhi!\u2019</i>.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><u><i>Swaram singing</i></u></div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Mami\u2019s swarams include interesting <i>kanakku</i> (mathematical patterns), fascinating \u2018parallels\u2019 (the name Mami assigns to singing three symmetric swara-phrases such as <i>srsndns-pdpmgmp-srsndns,</i> for instance), while retaining the raga bhava intact. Listeners have often remarked how effortlessly she combines <i>kanakku</i> with <i>bhava</i> \u2013 Mami has shown that the two are not mutually exclusive; she says that raga bhava is the soul of every moment of music; that swarams should have a meaning and a direction.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><u><i>Bringing the lyrics alive</i></u></div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">\u2018The most important aspects of a kriti and niraval singing are the raga bhava and the meaning of the lyrics\u2019 \u2013 is what Mami remarks often. She believes that <i>niraval</i> should only be sung where the meaning is complete. For example, in the Tyagaraja-kriti <i>Manasa etulortune</i> (Mayalamarutam), Mami sings niraval at the anupallavi line <i>\u2018Dinakarakula bhushanuni\u2019</i> instead of <i>\u2018Kalilo rajasa tamasa\u2019.</i> Similarly, in <i>Manasu svadinamaina</i> (Sankarabharanam), she sings niraval at <i>\u2018Raja rajesa niranjana nirupama\u2019</i> instead of <i>\u2018Tanuvu tanu\u2019.</i></div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Mami tells us that the lyrics should be sung with feeling \u2013 this is especially true when she sings Tamil compositions \u2013 for example, we can visualize the young Krishna with the dancing earrings when she sings <i>Om namo Narayana.</i> I remember a particularly embarrassing instance when I was playing the <i>tambura</i> for Mami\u2019s concert, and ended up in tears after Mami sang a most touching <i>viruttam</i> on Muruga.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><b>Neela Ramgopal the person</b></div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">People often ask Mami where she derives her ceaseless energy from. She points to her head, and says, \u2018It\u2019s all in the mind - you can be 73 in age, but must be 37 in thought and action\u2019. I have seen several times how she would have returned from a long journey from Trivandrum, or Chennai or Udupi, at 1 PM, cook for herself and Mama till 1: 20 PM, eat till 1:25 PM, and begin teaching at 1: 30 PM. Mami\u2019s indefatigable spirit especially at age 76 is amazing.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Mami is ecstatic when a disciple wins a prize or an award. Her faith in the abilities of her disciples is a source of strength, especially at moments when we feel doubtful or apprehensive. I recall an instance when I was a little nervous before going to a competition, and Mami reassured me by reposing her complete faith and belief in me. With her blessings, I won the award.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Mami is truly selfless. She teaches her students everything, without holding anything back, she gives the most practical advice. One of her students, in a new place after her marriage, found it difficult to get accustomed to the new culture. Mami advised her, \u201cYou have to make yourself like the place, make the place your own\u201d.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Mami is an extraordinarily affectionate person, and treats me as her own granddaughter. People in Chennai have often asked me when I am with Mami, \u201cAre you Neela Mami\u2019s granddaugher?\u201d, and I always say, \u201cI am like her own granddaughter!\u201d.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">Mami\u2019s music is peaceful and energetic at the same time \u2013 it is \u2018heavy\u2019, sophisticated, and truly classical.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">She is not just a prolific musician and a great guru, she is truly a wonderful human being \u2013 always unfailingly honest, affectionate and amazingly positive.</div><br />\u000a<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">She is an example of how to survive and win against all odds. Her music and the fighter in her have helped her to bounce back quickly from every trial and become the Neela Mami we love, admire and respect so much.</div></div>
