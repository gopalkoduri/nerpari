Over the last couple of months, a violin concert and three vocal concerts have happened. The next was to be a nagaswaram recital, they said. \u201cNagaswaram in a chamber?\u201d Well, not quite. Oli found the ambience that suits this majestic instrument. An open air setting in the compound of the late Chandralekha\u2019s house in Besant Nagar, bang on the beach road and yet, largely free from the noise of vehicles on the road (alas! not so lucky with a couple of aircraft that flew above!). <br />\u000a<br />\u000aI walked into the venue, listening to strains of Gambhira Nata (probably a mallari) and an adroit spell of tavil-playing in misra jati triputa tala. Tyagaraja\u2019s Marukelara (Jayantasri) prepared the listener for a melodic outpouring. The piece de resistance was Bhairavi. Kothandaraman\u2019s alapana was truly out of the world! Such gamaka-laden exposition, such dignity, majesty, melody, fertile imagination!.&nbsp; Sunil Gavaskar, in the commentator\u2019s box, said of Sourav Ganguly\u2019s innings (he scored 183) in the 1999 World Cup match against Sri Lanka at Taunton, \u201cI am blessed to have witnessed this match.\u201d Similar thoughts ran in the mind as the alapana progressed and was followed by Syama Sastri\u2019s immortal swarajati (Kamakshi). It was not Kothandaraman alone who held the show. There was Kongampattu A.G. Murugayyan who lifted the swarajati to cloud nine with his sensitive handling of the tavil. We know of mridanga artists who relate(d) brilliantly to the composition they play(ed) for. Here was a tavil vidwan who showed how much he could do with the tavil to enhance the rendition of a song. It took me a while to come out of this overwhelming experience and tune in to listen to the next raga, Natakurinji, in which Kothandaraman also showed his ability to play tanam, a rarity in nagaswaram. There was a pallavi in Adi tala, executed well with all the variations of speed, swaras and tani avartanam. One cannot fault the artist for not rising to the incredibly high standard he set in the Bhairavi piece! There was just one tukkada, a well-known ragamalika, Aarabhi manam vaithu and mangalam. The long applause by the 50-60 crowd that had gathered was richly deserved by the artists. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aDid Kothandaraman remind me of any yester year artist? The name that came to my mind was (the late) Vedaranyam Vedamurthi whose playing was soaked in melody. <br />\u000a<br />\u000aOli will go from here, from strength to strength, but what can the music/sabha fraternity do to provide hope to artists of such calibre? Carnatic music will survive, but the two instruments, nagaswaram and veena, which produce the finest nuances of the music, seem to be heading towards oblivion, if the dwindling numbers of audiences and of learners are any indicators.</div></div>
