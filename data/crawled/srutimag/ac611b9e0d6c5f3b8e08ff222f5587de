Balachandar</a> has a leading Carnatic musician traversed a\u000apath as unusual. Bombay Jayashri was all of 28 when she began a truly\u000afull-fledged performing career in Carnatic music. Though introduced in early\u000achildhood to Carnatic music, thanks to both her parents being music teachers,\u000ashe grew up in cosmopolitan Bombay, revelling in the singing of bhajan-s and\u000afilm music at functions small and large all over Maharashtra and Gujarat,\u000alearning Hindustani classical music, \u2018geet\u2019, film songs, and a variety of\u000a\u2018light music\u2019 genres.&nbsp;</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">Through childhood and college, she almost kept her\u000atraining in Carnatic music a secret. She had a ball singing jingles in several\u000alanguages extolling the wonderful attributes of Bournvita, Mealmaker and\u000aRexona, solo or in duets. Throughout this period, she was also learning\u000aCarnatic music from the rigorous school of T.R. Balamani, a renowned teacher of\u000aBombay, who also taught the likes of Shankar Mahadevan. She loved the film\u000asongs of Rafi, Lata and Asha, and continues unabashedly to do so, despite\u000astardom in Carnatic music. Mehdi Hasan and Farida Khanum are equally her\u000afavourites. She attributes her pitch perfect voice to her training in\u000aHindustani music and her soulful articulation to her eclectic musical\u000abackground. Her assimilation of such a varied range of musical ideas has\u000aensured the success of her theme-based albums like <i>Vaatsalyam </i>featuring\u000alullabies, or <i>Agni </i>showcasing Subramania Bharati\u2019s fiery lyrics. She\u000asees no conflict between her concert career and the film songs she has sung\u000aover the years.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">She\u000ararely performs in Chennai these days. Her December season concerts here are\u000anow limited to seven \u2013 to be reduced by one more next year, according to an\u000ainsider. Sruti suddham and a contemplative quality mark her singing. A\u000anoticeable feature of her concerts is the superior aesthetics of her singing.\u000aIn the past \u2013 especially after she resurfaced on the kutcheri platform after a\u000afour-year hiatus spent in drinking deep of the Lalgudi bani of music under\u000aviolin maestro Jayaraman\u2019s tutelage \u2013 she was accused of sweet, rather than\u000adeep music, crooning, and even singing \u201clike the violin\u201d in a soft voice.&nbsp;</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">Today\u000aher stillness and sonorous voice draw comparisons with <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_18.html" target="_blank">M.S. Subbulakshmi,</a>\u000athough the majestic voice sometimes seems to lose its vitality as the concert\u000aprogresses. Her stage presence is dignity personified. No flailing about of\u000aarms, no facial mannerisms mar her style, though by her own admission, it\u000aneeded a young teacher back in her teens to make her look into the mirror for\u000aher to achieve such poise. She often seems completely lost in the sheer beauty\u000aof the raga music she presents. She is firmly convinced that the musician can\u000atransmit her own deep-felt emotions to the rasika in the audience, no matter\u000awhat expectation brought him there in the first place.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">Jayashri\u000ais undoubtedly one of the leading lights of Carnatic music today, with a\u000aconsiderable fan following. She has also taken upon herself the task of\u000apropagating the music among young Indians in India and abroad. In partnership\u000awith T.M. Krishna she is involved in initiatives towards creating future\u000arasika-s as well as future musicians with a keen sense of history and\u000atradition. The organisation they founded, Matrka, brought out a coffee table\u000abook, <i>Voices Within</i>, a tribute to seven past masters of Carnatic music,\u000aand runs an annual event entitled <i>Svanubhava</i>, introducing to young\u000astudents the great music of the past through veteran musicians reliving for\u000athem the art of their guru-s and forgotten traditions.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">Jayashri\u000aappears to have arrived at an important juncture of her career, on the verge of\u000aa change of gears, a phase in which her voice should gain greater vibrancy and\u000aher music profundity, and her inward journey explore further the depths of the\u000agreat legacy she has inherited from the giants of Carnatic music. The\u000aatmosphere is electric when she ascends the concert stage, and she straightaway\u000acasts a spell with her perfectly sruti-aligned voice. It is not always easy to\u000alive up to the high expectations of her audiences, and it must take a\u000asuperhuman effort to satisfy them, though she is known to sing for herself, not\u000ato the gallery. Many feel she has the potential to become the top woman singer\u000ain Carnatic music, a potential she can fulfil if she reaches deeper into her\u000aown reservoir of talent \u2013 fearlessly, tirelessly.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">One of\u000aJayashri\u2019s greatest assets has been her closely-knit, supportive family. Her\u000afather, N.N. Subramaniam was a keen amateur singer and teacher, who did not\u000alive to see her become a successful vocalist. It was her mother\u2019s dream that\u000ashe has lived out. Her two brothers Balarajan and Sabesh are strong pillars of\u000asupport. (\u201cThey will drop everything and run to her if she needs them,\u201d says\u000asister-in-law Janaki Sabesh who combines a successful career marketing digital\u000acinema with acting in films, and is a trained vocalist herself). Both brothers\u000ahave learnt enough Carnatic music to critique and advise Jayashri. Both are\u000acompany executives and pursue music in their spare time, Sabesh carrying on the\u000afamily tradition of music teaching. Jayashri\u2019s husband Ramnath, a finance\u000aprofessional, is a genuine lover of music who enjoys singing Hindi and Bengali\u000afilm songs.&nbsp;</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">The extended family meets every year at some holiday spot; both\u000aduring these vacations and at every family get-together, planned or\u000aspontaneous, there is much music, from film to classical, and there is much\u000adiscussion of music as well. Janaki has also been associated with <i>Margazhi\u000aRagam</i>, the offbeat film of a Carnatic music concert featuring T.M. Krishna\u000aand Jayashri, through Real Image, the company she works for.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">The\u000abehind the scenes person most responsible for Jayashri\u2019s growth as a musician\u000ahas been her mother Seetha. Forced by her husband\u2019s premature death to teach\u000amusic for a living, she discovered when Jayashri was barely three, that she was\u000agifted, from the way she picked up the nuances of the Ranjani varnam while she\u000awas teaching older children the song in the next room. Seetha\u2019s tastes in music\u000aare unusually eclectic and she believed in exposing Jayashri to a wide range of\u000amusical influences. Whenever she heard a good musician or teacher, she made\u000asure Jayashri had a chance to learn from him or her.&nbsp;</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">\u201cActually, it was the\u000ateachers who were keen on teaching a child as talented as Jayashri,\u201d she says.\u000aThat is how Jayashri came to learn Hindustani music from Mahavir Jaipurwale and\u000aGautam Mukherjee, Carnatic music from T.R. Balamani and Bharatanatyam from guru\u000aKalyanasundaram. The mother admired the great Hindi film singers of yesteryear;\u000ano wonder her children, including the boys, won prizes in many a light music\u000acompetition.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">SVK\u000awriting in <i>The Hindu </i>once said of Jayashri, \u201cHer innate serenity\u000aenvelops her raga alapana-s and articulation of the sahitya-s of songs. Her\u000aapparently simple performing demeanour conceals her unerring insight into\u000aaesthetic classicism. The picturisation of raga-s at her hands is not so much\u000aon how she develops them, as on how she gives shape to their nuances. This she\u000aachieves by her capacity to lift her exposition to higher levels of felicitous\u000afinesse and exalted lyricism by delectable artistry. At the singing level its\u000amellifluous quality is overwhelming and at the receptive level the perception\u000aof listeners deepens to experience <i>santam.</i>\u201d<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">Another\u000acritic says, \u201cShe sings bhajan-s as well as, perhaps better than <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_18.html" target="_blank">M.S.Subbulakshmi</a>. Her music has the same sruti suddham, and meditative quality, but\u000aher voice sometimes seems to float instead of being anchored firmly to the\u000adepths of music. Her impressive swara singing, filled with raga\u000abhava, is constantly improving. Her raga alapana promises much but stops short\u000aof the great heights we anticipate. She seems to have worked very hard at\u000aimproving her enunciation of lyrics and the hard work shows. She has a\u000awonderful voice whose potential is yet to be totally exploited. She seems\u000aafraid of letting herself go completely. Excellent aesthetics mark her every\u000aconcert.\u201d<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">Gowri\u000aRamnarayan, reviewing a jugalbandi concert for <i>The Hindu </i>said, \u201cThrough\u000athe concert, the artists enjoyed each other\u2019s music. More important, each\u000aadapted seamlessly to meld with the other\u2019s genre, without sacrificing\u000aindividual identity. Ronu Majumdar\u2019s collaboration showed his empathy with\u000aCarnatic music; he was even able to touch on Carnatic gamaka-s here and there,\u000asuggestively, not intrusively. Having been trained in Hindustani music,\u000aJayashri made the coordination seem like child\u2019s play. Her strength was in\u000aresisting imitation, even in Jayjayvanti and Khammaj.\u201d<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">Jayashri\u2019s\u000abrother S. Sabesh, himself an accomplished amateur singer and teacher, says,\u000a\u201cEarlier Jayashri was a fearless, uninhibited explorer of manodharma, but in\u000arecent years she seems hampered by fear of criticism. Her strengths are many,\u000abut she has no obvious weaknesses, though I sometimes feel she could have done\u000aa particular raga greater justice, stopping short of the listener\u2019s\u000aexpectations, a charge that can be laid at any musician\u2019s doorstep.\u201d Sabesh and\u000ahis elder brother Balarajan are both solid pillars of support, immensely proud\u000aof Jayashri\u2019s accomplishments, but not known to shower praises on her after her\u000aconcerts.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">Both\u000aSVK and Gowri Ramnarayan, as well as other critics, have at other times been\u000acritical of what they saw as weaknesses or flaws in Jayashri\u2019s music,\u000aespecially her inadequate vocalisation in some concerts, but most of them have\u000anoticed substantial growth in all aspects of her music over the years.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">There\u000aare still some critics who are not satisfied. A \u201clong time rasika\u201d says,\u000a\u201cSerenity is the essence of Bombay Jayashri\u2019s music. We can go home after her\u000aconcert with a sense of peace and quiet. She has one of the sweetest voices in\u000aCarnatic music today \u2013 silken, malleable and even haunting. Her pleasant and\u000adignified stage presence adds to the ambience of the concert. But the expectant\u000arasika also wonders: Why does the music not travel beyond the voice and the\u000aserenity? Why is the best voice in the field least exploited by the artist? Why\u000ahas her growth as an individual artist not matched her lateral growth in the\u000afield of performing arts and media? Why is it that after over 20 years we do\u000anot have something we can call the inimitable Bombay Jayashri style? When will\u000aher spurts of open-mouthed, inspired singing turn into her consistent best?\u201d<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">Jayashri\u000ais a picture of confidence as a musician. She has a healthy self-esteem that\u000aenables her to take criticism in her stride. \u201cOnce you become a performing\u000amusician, you should be prepared to face and accept criticism,\u201d she recently\u000atold a group of young journalism students. (She bowled them over\u000acomprehensively with her candour and willingness to share). For someone of\u000aimmense pride in her art, she is also a humble student, willing to surrender to\u000athe teacher. Her attitude to criticism is best exemplified by an incident some\u000aten years ago, when she sought help from a reviewer \u2013 who had strongly\u000acriticized one of her concerts \u2013 to make some corrections, because she believed\u000ait was a case of constructive criticism.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt;">People\u000awho know Jayashri personally describe her as a good human being, a kind and\u000ahelpful one. She can be a thoughtful friend, relative or neighbour, with no\u000acelebrity airs about her, and she can be generous with her time as the\u000ajournalism students recently found out, but she is completely professional when\u000ait comes to work. She can be reclusive, unavailable to friends and rasika-s,\u000a\u201can enigma\u201d as a friend put it, especially while preparing for a concert. Don\u2019t\u000aexpect her to attend a feast the day before a concert, no matter how close you\u000amay be to her. That is the time she needs to practise, meditate, rest. She\u000aneeds time to herself, to reach towards her ultimate musical goals. \u201cThe best\u000aof Jayashri is yet to come,\u201d her mother told us. A happy prospect.</span><o:p></o:p></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
