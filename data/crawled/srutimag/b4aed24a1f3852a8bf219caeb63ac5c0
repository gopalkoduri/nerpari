He gets musicians from outside to visit once a\u000ayear. Four years ago Veenavadini invited me. They enjoyed my teaching a lot and\u000aI enjoyed being there too. &nbsp;My visits became regular. Some of these\u000alessons were video-recorded and uploaded on YouTube. The Tirupati based Sri\u000aVenkatesa Bhakti Channel telecast around 200 episodes of the programme.

But looking back, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi\u000awas among those south Indians who became luminaries in the north Indian style.\u000aHow many south Indians are really open to Hindustani music is debatable. The\u000alate M S Gopalakrishnan Sir was very competent in the Hindustani field for\u000aexample and my colleague Sri Sanjay Subrahmanyan is a Carnatic musician open to\u000aHindustani ragas \u2013 he\u2019ll sing a pallavi in Bageshri, for instance. Then again\u000athere are fundamentalist groups who think Behag, Sindhubhairavi, Yamuna\u000aKalyani, Sivaranjani and their ilk should be totally done away with.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="color: #222222;"><br /></span></b></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="color: #222222;">Do you use the same style of teaching as your gurus?</span></b></span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="color: #222222;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I had four gurus, one of whom is alive today. Each guru had\u000asomething special. For example, my first vocal guru Vechoor Hariharasubramania\u000aIyer Sir would repeat parts of songs as many times as I wanted, until I got it\u000aright. But he&nbsp;wouldn't&nbsp;allow recording. I imbibed his level of\u000apatience. My two veena gurus Trivandrum R.Venkatraman Sir and K.S.Narayansamy\u000aSir were very analytical, splitting phrases into the smallest fragments until\u000aeach gamakam became perfectly clear. Dr.Balamuralikrishna Sir\u2026\u000ahe&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;really teach, per se. He could be compared to a sumptuous\u000abuffet in a five-star hotel. All sorts of goodies would be there in front of\u000ayou and you could help yourself to whatever you liked. Only an advanced student\u000acan truly benefit from him, because he doesn\u2019t repeat parts of the song 300\u000atimes or break it up into smaller fragments. While teaching, he would sing as\u000ahe would in concert. But he has absolutely no problem if you record him. I\u000arecord his lessons and the tape recorder becomes my guru as I play them over\u000aand over again. &nbsp;So, my teaching style is essentially a combination of all\u000athese different approaches.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="color: #222222;"><br /></span></b></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="color: #222222;">What do you like about the way Swarasadhana was\u000aorganized?</span></b><span style="color: #222222;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">It was a very sincere effort. Sometimes there are big moneyed\u000aorganizations that might help you with&nbsp;organizing&nbsp;something but their\u000aeffort might not be genuine. Outside India, you get much more money for\u000ateaching but no job satisfaction, much of the time. There could be exceptions,\u000athough.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="color: #222222;"><br /></span></b></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="color: #222222;">Does your title make things easier for you?</span></b><span style="color: #222222;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I don\u2019t use the title myself. If I did, I could have this royal\u000aimage tag that could give me certain advantages. But people have branded me as\u000aa prince in virtually every report where my name appears. If you look at my\u000avisiting card, it does not use the title. It\u2019s just Rama Varma. I follow this\u000arule even when I write an article or produce a CD. Earlier there was a\u000amisconception that I used my title and family influence to get concert\u000aopportunities or obtain sponsors easily. People did not know that my family was\u000atotally against my performing publicly. As royal patrons they believed that\u000atheir duty was only to endorse and financially support musicians and singers.\u000aThis tradition (in the Travancore royal family) was first broken by me.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="color: #222222;"><br /></span></b></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="color: #222222;">You have said that classical music should be accessible\u000ato the common man.

While Christianity emphasizes a congregational effort,\u000aHinduism allows more individualism. The same principle applies to our singing.\u000aIf ten persons were to sing Vatapi Ganapatim bhajeham, they would choose\u000adifferent tempos and even different sangatis. Our classical music is meant to\u000abe a solitary pursuit with potential for instant creativity, pushing limits and\u000aexploring new methods. Of course, we also have bhajans which sound beautiful\u000awhen sung as a group.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="color: #222222;"><br /></span></b></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="color: #222222;">So the team effort in Carnatic music is\u000arestricted to the main musician and accompanists.</span></b><span style="color: #222222;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Yes. There are also cases of students who have studied under the\u000asame guru and sing perfectly in sync. But when I lived in Europe earlier for 10\u000ayears, I sometimes had to do concerts without accompaniment or microphones.\u000aThey were just solo performances with the tambura. It gave scope for\u000aelaboration in raga alapana and other new ideas, without worrying about\u000acoordinating with the accompanists. Singing alone has its own rewards but you\u000ashould be knowledgeable enough to know how to go about it. It requires great\u000astamina, aesthetic sense and a sense of proportion.\u000aThere&nbsp;shouldn't&nbsp;be any hesitation in the mind. Otherwise it is better\u000ato stick with your team and perform.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="color: #222222;"><br /></span></b></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><b><span style="color: #222222;">What are your plans?</span></b><span style="color: #222222;">&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span></div>\u000a<div style="background: white; text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">To continue the same as much as possible. When I was 20 years\u000aold, I never thought I\u2019d go to Europe. While in Europe I never thought I\u2019d go\u000ato that small village in Karnataka to teach. My family and Dr.\u000aBalamuralikrishna never got along, but I ended up learning so much from him. I\u000awas initially attracted by some of his compositions thinking I would just learn\u000aa tillana or two and leave. But it\u2019s been 19 years since that meeting took\u000aplace and I\u2019m still learning from him. I just go with the flow, more or less.

After the exams, I remember that Sean Connery\u2019s\u000acomeback film as James Bond, \u2018Never Say Never Again\u2019 had just been released. All\u000amy friends planned ahead and went for it. I finished my exam and came back in\u000athe evening for my music class. I&nbsp;realized&nbsp;even then that\u000aI&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;be without it, without ever imagining I would be a singer.\u000aThey say the same about marriage: you&nbsp;should marry not someone you can live with but someone you can\u2019t live without.
