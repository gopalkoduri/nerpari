An autorickshaw driver parks his vehicle in front of the house in the corner of the lane and informs the resident on his mobile, \u201cI am here!\u201d Richard Wolf responds, \u201cNallathu\u201d (\u2018Good\u2019). He comes out, sits comfortably in the three-wheeler, and says, \u201cPogalaam!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThe auto moves fast towards T\u2019 Nagar, crosses the crowded Panagal Park area and races towards West Mambalam. Once it reaches Srinivasan Street near Ayodhya Mandapam, it slows down and stops in front of a large compound with a closed gate.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cAnju manikku vanthidu!\u201d (\u2018Come at 5 o\u2019clock\u2019) Wolf tells the auto-driver softly. In the sprawling house, he meets his guru, Ranganayaki Rajagopalan, an octogenarian, sitting on a cot, both her legs stretched in front of her. He greets her gently, opens a large wooden cupboard and takes out two veenas one by one. He offers one to her and puts the other one down on the carpet.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI am going to perform at Coonoor. May I play Kalyani now?\u201d Wolf asks his guru in Tamil and she says, \u201cYes, go ahead\u201d, again in Tamil. The guru plays the alapana and the disciple follows, sangati by sangati. Then he takes up a short tanam before embarking on the kriti \u2018<i>Etavunara</i>\u2019, while his teacher keenly watches him.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cTanam avarukku special!\u201d Ranganayaki compliments him. Wolf acknowledges it with a shy smile. The conversation seems to be between an affectionate mother and dutiful son.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aRichard Wolf, Professor of Music in Harvard University, is here on a sabbatical, having obtained a Fulbright scholarship through the American Institute of Indian Studies in New Delhi, for further training in veena from his Ranganayaki Rajagopalan of the Karaikudi school of veena playing.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI will be here till 20th August and leave for Tajikistan!\u201d says Wolf. He will also visit Lahore in Pakistan. \u201cI will come again next June and stay here for three months.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aHis friend and mridanga player Umayalpuram Mali arrives for practice and Wolf is ready for the day\u2019s work.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHe has learnt six kriti-s in this one month \u2013 in June. He is a keen learner!\u201d (Wolf begins slowly playing \u2018Jalandhara\u2019 and it serves as background score for Mali\u2019s narration.) \u201cJalandhara in Valaji, Manasu vishaya in Nattaikurinji, Ma Janaki in Kambhoji, Aparadhamula in Latangi, Bhajana seya in Dharmavati and Devadi deva in Sunada Vinodini! Isn\u2019t it amazing what he can do?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMali was with Wolf at Harvard for about five months on a Fulbright fellowship this year. \u201cThree years ago, he played a pallavi in Keeravani, Tisra triputa talam, in Brandeis University in Boston. Raja Rao accompanied him on the mridanga. It was a wonderful performance. He played trikalam!\u201d Mali tells us excitedly.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAccording to Mali, Wolf puts in great effort to learn a kriti. \u201cPlaying \u2018Vara Narada\u2019 in Vijayasri or Kripa Juchutaku in Chhaya tarangini, on the veena can be difficult, with their demanding sangati-s. Wolf played them comfortably during a symposium at Harvard.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWe presented a lot of items in Harvard. Four days a week, two hours a day in an international rhythm symposium. After the symposium, we demonstrated ragam-tanam-pallavi. Two participants, Richard Widdss and James Kippen dwelt on Indian music, while other scholars spoke on their countries\u2019 music,\u201d Wolf told us.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aRichard Wolf has published a book, \u2018The Black House Footprint\u2019 on the Adivasi-s of Nilgiris. It is about religion, time, space and music. His second book \u2018The Voice in the Drums\u2019 is almost finished, he says. \u201cIt is partly music and partly fiction\u2019. It is being published by University of Illinois Press, U.S.A.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI was into serious academic work and research. Mali brought me back to music and performance.\u201d Wolf smiles.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cDidn\u2019t his guru tell you that he is an intelligent learner?\u201d Mali says with a broad smile.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aRichard Wolf does \u2018sadhakam\u2019 meticulously for a minimum of two to three hours everyday. Even during the classes at Ranganayaki\u2019s residence, he plays for at least a couple of hours. He is full of admiration for her. \u201cShe has many ailments and yet forgets everything while teaching.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aRanganayaki Rajagopalan has undergone knee replacement surgery, and has been operated on for colon cancer. She suffers from Parkinson\u2019s too, besides asthma.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShe is of course known as a torchbearer of the Karaikudi Subbarama Iyer-Sambasiva Iyer school. \u201cI was the only one taught by them. I was three when my mother left me in the care of her elder sister who resided close to my gurus\u2019 house at Karaikudi. I wanted to go out and play and I had no interest in veena and totally disliked music.\u201d says Ranganayaki Rajagopalan, recalling those childhood days.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aRichard Wolf has trained in vocal music too, under Madurai Kamala Ramamurthy, a disciple of T.M. Thyagarajan.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aI ask Wolf, \u201cHow did you find your guru?\u201d&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">"An earlier student of hers, Paul Butler, suggested her name. I landed right here and found her.\u201d</span></div></div>
