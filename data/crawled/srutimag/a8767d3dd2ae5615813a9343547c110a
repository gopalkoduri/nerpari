The artistic members of the\u000afamily, who tend to secretly sneer at the sports-minded, are determined to\u000ainstil spirituality in their offspring by exposing them to the fine arts of music\u000aand dance, especially of the Mylapore or Kalakshetra kind.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal">\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Some\u000athirty years ago, cousin Cheenu, who loved his school so much that he spent\u000aextra years in some of his classes, had the opportunity to show off his\u000ascripture knowledge as someone belonging to an artistic family. He was the only\u000astudent to put his hand up when the teacher asked his class to inform her who\u000awrote the Mahabharata. I can imagine the proud if short-lived smile on his face\u000aas he piped up, \u201cKamala Subrahmanyam\u201d after the teacher let him speak up.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal">\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal">\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Shankar\u000aand Raju surprised their parents with the alacrity with which they volunteered\u000ato accompany the elders of the family one evening from their Kilpauk home to\u000athe Ananta Padmanabha Swami temple at Adyar to listen to a cutcheri by Jon Higgins.\u000aImagine their shock and discomfiture when they discovered that the singer of\u000athe evening was not their hero the English professor Henry Higgins from My Fair\u000aLady, but a bhagavatar from North America! </span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal">\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal">\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">The\u000asame pair of rascals also learned some noble lessons by watching the\u000aKalakshetra Ramayana series and other mythologicals. They invariably assumed\u000athe roles of asuras in their own production of such plays at home afterwards.\u000aHanging their sisters\u2019 dolls upside down and torturing them in a variety of ways,\u000athey also let out blood curdling war cries to add to the effect. Plays based on\u000athe Bhagavatam were sufficient inspiration for them to take turns enacting the\u000aviolent excesses of Kamsa, their siblings\u2019 dolls once again adding a touch of\u000arealism to their stirring performances. </span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal">\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal">\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Back\u000ain the late 1980s, my wife and I decided that it was time our He-Man obsessed\u000afive-year-old, Abu, benefited from the great philosophical and moral lessons of\u000athe Ramayana and took him to Kalakshetra\u2019s Art Festival. We were much impressed\u000aand heartened when he sat still and wide-eyed throughout the production. The\u000abrilliance of his enactment of Jatayuvadham\u2014with some help from his plastic\u000aHe-Man sword\u2014that night in our drawing room has seldom been bettered.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a</div>\u000a
