We all know however that our chief guest today is a true Gandhi. His is a rare pedigree. With two of India\u2019s greatest sons for grandfathers, Gopalkrishna started with an almost unfair advantage.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">But look at what he has done with that silver spoon\u2014in the ultimate alchemy that an individual can possibly accomplish, he has turned it to platinum: all by his own effort and diligence.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Outstanding scholar, civil servant, diplomat, author, poet, translator, columnist, public speaker non pareil,\u2014doesn\u2019t he seem too good to be true?</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Very briefly, Gopalkrishna Gandhi studied English Literature at St. Stephen\u2019s College, New Delhi, and qualified for the Indian Administrative Service in 1968, joining the service in its Tamil Nadu cadre.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">He has held several important positions as high commissioner, ambassador, and most recently as Governor of West Bengal.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">A reference to him in Outlook magazine says:</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cA discreet, highly competent IAS official for much of his career, Gandhi is also the gifted and formidably multi-lingual scholar who translated Vikram Seth\u2019s <i>A Suitable Boy</i> into Hindi, wrote a novel, <i>Refuge,</i> on Tamil plantation workers in Sri Lanka, and a life of lost Mughal scion Dara Shukoh in verse (in iambic pentameter\u2014my learned wife informs me).</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cHe was an extremely popular High Commissioner to South Africa, even more because of his endearing personal style than his lineage. Typically, he went off quietly to do earthquake relief work in rural Gujarat before taking on that assignment. As a Governor of West Bengal who often travels incognito into the countryside, Gandhi has earned great respect for deploring state violence in Nandigram. Of course, he has also earned great flak, from critics ranging from liberal apologists for the CPI (M), to the right-wing pro-SEZ camp.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Gopal Gandhi\u2019s latest literary effort has been to edit My dear Bapu: Letters from C Rajagopalachari to Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Devadas Gandhi and Gopalkrishna Gandhi.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Allow me to read from a couple of letters in this wonderful collection:</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i>My dear Bapu,</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i><br />\u201cLike the scientists that discovered truths and gave weapons to the warmongers you have given Satyagraha to the world, to the curers of social and political diseases, as well as the mischief-makers. We cannot help or even regret it, any more than we can blame science for the poison gas or the bombs.\u201d</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i><br />Love, Raja.</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i><br />My dear Gopu,</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i><br />Amma brought the three beautiful Mussoorie group pictures and showed them to me. It was an infinite pleasure to see the happy faces of the young administrators gathered together. The pleasure would have been complete if I could bring myself to foresee a happy and successful administration.\u201d</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i><br />Love, Anna</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">At this point, just to reinforce the impression all of us have of this truly admirable Indian, let me quote from Ramachandra Guha, author of India After Gandhi.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u201cUnlike scions of other freedom-fighters, they (the brothers Rajmohan, Ramchandra and Gopalkrishna) never exploited or abused the name of their grandfather. Where the direct descendants of other famous Indians have acted as if they were owed something\u2014or a great deal\u2014by India, these three brothers always asked themselves what they could do for India. Their lives have been marked by an exemplary devotion to their country, and to the principles of its founding fathers.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Known for his courage, principles and ethics, Gopalkrishna Gandhi is also a man of humour, sensitivity and keen appreciation of the finer points of the arts. He is a steadfast friend and supporter of individuals and institutions engaged in the arts. While remaining firmly anchored in his core beliefs in stressful situations, he also stays cool and understated.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">It is our proud privilege to welcome in our midst Sri Gopalkrishna Gandhi, and his wife Smt. Tara Gandhi.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I stand before you today as the editor of a unique magazine as it enters its 30th year because its founder-editor Dr N Pattabhi Raman took the foolhardy step of plunging into serious performing arts journalism in October 1983, amidst many a dire prediction of its early demise.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">He and his devoted band of colleagues and successors have kept it going against heavy odds for nearly three decades, without sacrificing the commitment to quality writing with which it started.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Pattabhi was able to collect around him a whole lot of talented people devoted to writing on the arts.&nbsp; I shall briefly mention a handful of these associates past and present and salute them for their contributions to the magazine over the decades.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">His two brothers and co-founders PN Sundaresan and PN Venkatraman.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Sangita Kala Acharya S Rajam whose paintings and columns on music have enriched Sruti.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Cartoonist Sarathy.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Naturalist, photographer and columnist M Krishnan.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Music expert T Sankaran.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Musicologists Dr N Ramanathan and SK Saxena</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Critics, correspondents and editors VS Sundararajan</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Gowri Ramnarayan, Sunil Kothari, Leela Venkatraman, S Krishnan, Manna Srinivasan, Sulochana Pattabhiraman, Deepak Raja, V Sriram, Lakshmi Devnath, KS Kalidas, Sujatha Vijayaraghavan, Nandini Ramani, Gayathri Sundaresan, Vamanan&nbsp; and many others who have contributed from time to time.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Finally a big thank you to The Sanmar Group and our trustee Sukanya Sankar for their quiet, unintrusive support, and my colleagues S Janaki, Sudha Narayanan, Sumathi Viswanathan, Kalpana Muralikrishnan, S Riswan, and C Balu.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span>\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Welcome one and all to what promises to be a rewarding evening.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a</div>\u000a
