For three days after the first interview, Ajith expected no call and didn\u2019t get one. Then, like a husband with his wife nearing her \u2018due\u2019 date, he started expecting a phone call at any moment and obsessed over being around his phone at all times. At the end of the week, he realised he had to make the phone calls, but met with the irritating switched-off-voice every time he called. Slowly, he grew desperate and started calling Nethra everyday, whining to her about geniuses and their need to show to the world that they were eccentric. People always mistake eccentricity for genius, he told her, and most often, geniuses are taken seriously only when they are eccentric.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThe very next morning, Shankar called. \u201cSir wants you to come at three-fifteen this afternoon.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAt three-ten, Ajith found the front door wide open and Shankar sitting in the verandah and ironing a <i>veshti</i> with great concentration. The old iron traversed the garment in careful straight lines, crisping it in the process. Shankar looked up when he heard the gate and peered happily at Ajith through those black glasses. For a moment, the iron left the garment and rested on a side table.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHello!\u201d Shankar exclaimed. Ajith waved, as he approached the verandah. Shankar placed a chair next to his own, and asked Ajith to sit. Ajith obeyed. Shankar then disappeared inside the house. Ajith, partly mechanically, and partly because it seemed like fun, began ironing the <i>veshti.</i> Almost three minutes later, Mani appeared at the front door, preceded by a four-legged walker and escorted by Shankar.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cGood afternoon!\u201d Mani said, sounding as cheery as he did the other day, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to iron my <i>veshti,</i> you know! Only my students do that...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShankar lunged to take the iron out of Ajith\u2019s hand, while Ajith put the iron away on the side table. \u201cIt\u2019s an honour!\u201d Ajith said.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani laughed. Shankar went into the house and returned in a moment with a folding easy chair. He placed it in the verandah facing the road. Mani sat on the chair. Ajith and Shankar then took their seats next to him, and Ajith put his recorder on the armrest of Mani\u2019s chair.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYou are looking so much better today!\u201d Ajith said.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI am better! But the end is near... I can feel it,\u201d Mani said, in a natural, cheery tone.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith merely smiled and said, \u201cMy grandmother always says, \u2018After seventy, everything is a bonus.\u2019\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani said expressionlessly, \u201cBonus?! It\u2019s a curse, I tell you. The physical torture I go through each day. I wish it all just ended.\u201d A silence followed that statement. \u201cWhere were we?\u201d Mani asked, unmindful of the reaction his declaration had caused.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith took a second before replying, \u201cYou told us about the girl in Tanjavur...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cMadurai,\u201d Mani corrected him.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith looked at him curiously. \u201cYou said Madurai? I somehow thought it was Tanjavur...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cNo. Madurai.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith was pretty sure the short story by Janani referred to the Tanjavur Railway Station, but he wasn\u2019t sure of what Mani had told him. He couldn\u2019t believe that there could be a discrepancy between Mani\u2019s story and Janani\u2019s.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani broke the silence with, \u201cThat story\u2019s over. What next?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYou were saying... You were saying you met that woman again, but she didn\u2019t recognise you...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to tell you that story,\u201d Mani said, looking mischievously at Ajith through the corner of his eye.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith tried again, \u201cBut if you met her again\u2026\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI told you. I don\u2019t want to get into that.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThere was a long silence that Ajith broke with, \u201cSir, are you actually a recluse? Or is that just a perception?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI\u2019m not fond of social gatherings. Except kutcheris,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cI like smaller groups of people for social interaction. I get uncomfortable when I am at a wedding or a function. Too many people know me, too many people have met me. I am always worried that I\u2019m inadvertently ignoring people, or I\u2019ve slighted someone, or I\u2019ve been over-friendly with someone I don\u2019t know too well. It scares me. So, I avoid all these events. People then think I\u2019m introverted or anti-social. I like a group of three or four people. Then, we\u2019re all talking to each other, we can all have our conversations. I\u2019m spending time with all of them. Large gatherings are overwhelming. Frightening.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith did not know how to maneuver this odd conversation. Mani then said, \u201cTo tell you the truth, the world inside my head is far richer than the world outside it. I prefer living there.\u201d<br />\u000aAjith knotted his eyebrows. Mani signalled something to Shankar. Shankar got up and went inside the house.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThen, Mani said, \u201cEven in my childhood, I had a world inside my head. It was, usually, a version of the world outside. Real people are more complicated in my head than they are in real life. Emotions are stronger, responses are magnified, scenes are in full colour and 3-D. If my father was actually cold and strict, in my head, he would be caring - and perhaps he was on the inside! If I was known for my singing everywhere, I was an actor in my head. I always wanted to act in the movies, and imagined my Abhimanyu play being made into a famous movie. When I watched <i>Ben-hur</i> in Bombay, I was blown away! I spent months trying to convince directors here to make an Abhimanyu movie on that scale and cast me in it. And I would spend days imagining myself in those movies, acting, singing, fighting, romancing... And giving interviews! I read these film magazines that came from Bombay with interviews from the stars. I must\u2019ve been in my twenties by then, but the interviews really fascinated me. And because no one ever wanted to interview a Carnatic musician then, I imagined interviews, answers, reactions.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cBut then, you know, the world is a noisy place. You can\u2019t hear what is inside you when the world chatters all around you. An artist needs to spend enough time in that world inside his head. If someone says he has no such world, he\u2019s no artist at all. He\u2019s just a photocopying machine. A musician\u2019s music should be his own. Not someone else\u2019s.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThis Shankar, for instance,\u201d Mani said, pointing at Shankar who entered again with the usual tea and Marie biscuits, \u201cSings brilliantly. Lovely voice. But sings only my sangatis. I sometimes think he writes down my raga alapanas in a notebook and reproduces them.\u201d Shankar attempted some form of protest, but Mani cut him off and continued, \u201cHe has a band of followers now - a cult of old men and women who liked my music. They hear me in his voice, in his style... Not good at all. I don\u2019t teach him anything these days. Just let him sing on his own. I don\u2019t even correct him if he makes a mistake. He needs to live in his head for a while.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cSir exaggerates,\u201d Shankar said, nibbling on his biscuit.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aIt was a confused monologue from Mani that seemed to start nowhere and end nowhere. Ajith wondered if he was going a little senile. He sipped his tea, and found it tasted like dissolved mud. It was the sort of tea his grandmother made \u2013 boil cheap tea powder in milk, strain, add milk, sugar, boil everything together and serve hot. The same procedure could result in excellent chai, like the tea kadai at the end of Boag Road proved, but his grandmother and Shankar had got something wrong. Perhaps, they did use mud.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aJust then, a Maruti 800 pulled up by the main gate. An old man got out, opened the gate and drove straight in. Mani called out joyously, \u201cSivan!\u201d and said to Ajith, \u201cMy brother, Sadasivam.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aSadasivam waved from the car, parked it, got out and hollered, \u201cAnna! Not bad! You\u2019re sitting in the verandah!\u201d and looking at Shankar and Ajith asked, \u201c<i>Sishyaalaa?</i>\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThat one with the glasses, he is Shankar, my student. He lives with me now.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cOf course I know Shankar,\u201d Sadasivam said, suddenly recognising him.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cAnd this one here, Ajith,\u201d he paused, \u201cAm I right? Ajith?\u201d Ajith nodded. \u201cYes. He is Ajith. A reporter from <a href="http://www.sruti.com/" target="_blank"><i>Sruti</i> magazine.</a> Interviewing me.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cMy Anna is a big fraud,\u201d Sadasivam said, \u201cAlways telling people that he\u2019s an ordinary fellow and all that. Even he doesn\u2019t know the extent of his genius.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re not fooled by him!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani said, \u201cAjith, I need to take my brother inside the house \u2013 I\u2019m just getting rid of some furniture.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShankar helped Mani to his feet, but Mani brushed him aside. \u201cSiva will take me from here!\u201d<br />\u000aSadasivam gleefully put his hand on Mani\u2019s shoulder and guided him through the door. He turned to Ajith and said, \u201cCome with us. You can continue the interview while we look at the furniture.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith walked with them into the bare drawing room and through the dining room to the landing where the stairs led to the first floor. Lurking at the far end of the landing, partly hidden by the stairs and partly by the dim light, was a door that Ajith wouldn\u2019t have noticed if Shankar hadn\u2019t opened it. It led to a room that was a grand bedroom in its heyday, where the owners of the house slept. Now, it was a storeroom for old furniture and books. Ajith recognised it as the room he saw on the first day when he opened a loose window. Sadasivam said, \u201cI need a bookshelf and a study table. I\u2019m converting the first floor sit-out into a study of sorts.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani stood with his walker at the head of the room and said, \u201cLeave that one there on the right for me. It has my cassettes. Take anything else.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aSadasivam scanned the room, moving furniture around to make space for himself. He spotted a large bookshelf at the near corner filled with Tamil books and said, \u201cThat shelf looks good.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith, meanwhile, walked straight to the shelf with Mani\u2019s cassettes. It was a fascinating collection of Mani\u2019s music, concerts from the 1950s to the 1990s, all arranged in chronological order, labelled in crisp English lettering, with the year, sabha, accompanists and main ragam, on the sleeve. Ajith saw TNK, TKM, UKS, PR and other familiar abbreviations on many covers. There was one that caught his fancy. \u201cSC (nagaswaram)\u201d, it said. Ajith asked, across the room, \u201cYou\u2019ve sung with Sheikh Chinnamoula-saheb?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani said, \u201cOh yes! Three concerts. All of them were bad! When I sang with Rajaratnam Anna, it was so beautiful. I was trying to recreate that effect, but it didn\u2019t come off. There\u2019s one next to this cassette with T. Viswanathan on flute, right?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYes.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThat was a great concert: Saveri, Suddha Saveri, and Asaveri were the first three ragas.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYes!\u201d Ajith said in amazement, \u201cHow do you remember such things?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShankar said from near the other bookshelf, \u201cOnce, I told him that I had a recording of his 1980 concert at Bangalore, with a Todi ragam-tanam-pallavi in it. M.S. Gopalakrishnan on violin. And he said...\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThere\u2019s Sahana, Kanada, and Hindolam in the ragamalika. Yes, I remember that concert very well!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith suddenly noticed something out of place. There was a set of Pink Floyd cassettes! \u201cSir, you listen to Pink Floyd?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aSadasivam laughed, and Mani joined him. Mani said, \u201cI gave a concert in London, after which Roger Waters gave them to me. I never tell people this, because they never believe me. I\u2019m sure even you think it\u2019s an old man\u2019s hallucination.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYou know what is special about Anna\u2019s music? It is universal, every damn fellow loves it. He is a true genius.\u201d Sadasivam said, now looking for a study table.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani said, \u201cI wish I could be like my brother.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cWhat rubbish!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cSiva, you don\u2019t know. You have such an advantage in that you understand people around you. I\u2019m always a little lost, always the oddball. People like me from a distance \u2013 it is their admiration for what I am and what I\u2019ve achieved.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cDon\u2019t get fooled by this self-pity, Ajith. Anna has admirers who will do anything for him. Ask Shankar.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShankar agreed.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cAdmirers?\u201d Mani asked, \u201cI don\u2019t see a single one at home today. You don\u2019t understand, Siva. I can\u2019t walk, there are things eating me up from the inside. Doctors are trying to prolong my existence, God knows why. And my children are in the US. Too busy to spend time with me. You fractured your leg and your son came to India for a month. It\u2019s my fault. I wasted my life being a <i>genius.</i> I should\u2019ve been with them more when they were younger.\u201d Mani addressed Ajith now, \u201cLook at Sadasivam, I\u2019m sure you like him already, with his easy charm. I would\u2019ve preferred being like him.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cThe whole world wants to be you, Anna. Now shut up.\u201d After a moment, Sadasivam sighed and said, \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to buy a new study table. Nothing here.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani turned around, his walker clanking against the red-oxide floor as he walked into the landing, into the dining room.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aSuddenly, he told Sadasivam, \u201cDai, Siva! Take me to the beach?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aSoon, Ajith found himself in the old Maruti 800 with Mani, Sadasivam and Shankar, hurtling away towards Marina Beach.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aSadasivam asked, \u201cAjith, you\u2019ve been with <a href="http://www.sruti.com/" target="_blank"><i>Sruti</i></a> for long?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cSix months.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cOh. Where were you before that?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI was with a market research firm in Bombay.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cDidn\u2019t like Bombay?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cUmm, sort of. But I was always looking to come back.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cYour parents live here?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aShankar interjected, \u201cYou live with your grandmother, don\u2019t you?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith said, \u201cYeah. My mother\u2019s no more. She died when I was barely two.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Sadasivam said. \u201cWhat about your father?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHe married again and left me with his parents. They brought me up.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThere was an uncomfortable silence. Mani decided to break it with, \u201cSo, Ajith what does your grandfather do?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cHe was in the I.R.S. He\u2019s also no more. I moved back to Madras because my grandmother was alone.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThat was the second successive awkward silence. Everyone muttered a sorry, but said little more. Ajith said, \u201cHe was old.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aFinally, Mani said to Sadasivam, \u201cHey, I.R.S! You may know him!\u201d and said to Ajith, \u201cSiva\u2019s an I.A.S. retired.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aSadasivam said, \u201cWhat was his name?\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cS. Ramachandran.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThat revelation produced the most awkward of the three silences. Sadasivam said, with a fake enthusiasm, \u201cRam is an old friend! Great man, he was! Great man. The most honest of them all. That\u2019s not very common in the revenue department, you know!\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aMani went unnaturally quiet until they reached the beach. Ajith realised he shouldn\u2019t have given away his grandfather\u2019s identity. His cover of being an innocent young fellow trying to understand Mani was exposed. Mani would soon suspect that Ajith was only interested in one story. The story of his grand-aunt. Mani\u2019s openness, his twinkling eyes, the rants, the vague stories would all go.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a\u201cIn the 50s,\u201d Mani told Shankar, \u201cwhen I was around your age, I used to practise here, on the beach. There was almost nobody. Can you imagine Marina like that? In that corner, sometimes I would hear a piercing flute, especially early in the morning. That was N. Ramani. He often stayed with <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_28.html" target="_blank">Mali</a> in Triplicane during his school holidays, but <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_28.html" target="_blank">Mali</a> would often want to sleep in the mornings and ask poor Ramani not to practise. So, he would come here, and play with the waves as his accompanists. Imagine his breath control, playing amidst a strong sea breeze! We would wave to each other, and sit out of earshot and concentrate on our practice. Sometimes, after practice, we walked back to my house and had a coffee together.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAjith imagined the young, handsome Mani, with his striking voice, the drone of the tambura and lashing waves. And he looked at Mani today, his walker clanking ahead of him as he navigated the pavement towards a cement bench. His brain suddenly conjured another image, of a middle-aged Mani, still handsome, and Ajith\u2019s grandaunt, a most beautiful woman, sitting together on this very beach, oblivious to the scandal they were creating in their homes.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(<a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/08/sruti-fiction_4.html" target="_blank">To be continued</a>)</span></b>&nbsp;</span></div><div style="text-align: right;"><br />\u000a</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Disclaimer: This is a work of fiction, with fictional characters.
