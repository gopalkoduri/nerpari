He didn\u2019t know the grammar of music. He was very intelligent, though he did not utilise his gifts fully. When he played ragam-tanam-pallavi, he had no equal.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aUnfortunately, he started focusing on stretching the strings. That proved to be his undoing. You can\u2019t depend on your muscles in music. When you are older, you can\u2019t count on your virility. The same is the case with dance. Only abhinaya can serve you in the long run.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i>Did he learn from you?</i></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aHe accompanied me on the khanjira and tabla for ten years. It was pleasant, enjoyable music, not like regular kutcheri-s. He learnt by kelvi gnanam. He would not learn from me. It was a matter of prestige for him.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i>How did you get the idea of depicting music in your paintings?</i></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aHari Rao, son of Sangita Kalanidhi T.V. Subba Rao, was the manager of the Higginbothams bookstore. He showed me letter pads with Omar Khayyam illustrations and asked me if I could do something similar for Carnatic music. That is how I did the series for our music. <i>Sruti</i> Pattabhiraman saw the letterpads and asked me to do similar illustrations to be published every month. Semmangudi told me he liked the letterpads so much that he did not use them to write letters, keeping them with himself. I wanted people to use them and create interest in our music in the recipients of their letters.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<i>Any unforgettable experiences in your music career?</i></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QkMR1yz7qK8/T_uqRMx2uSI/AAAAAAAAAs8/mpugZoyfQ_M/s1600/Trinity.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="193" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QkMR1yz7qK8/T_uqRMx2uSI/AAAAAAAAAs8/mpugZoyfQ_M/s320/Trinity.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">I think it was 1980. I was singing at a 24-hour Dikshitar akhandam at Ettayapuram. My painting was the backdrop to the 40\u2019 by 40\u2019 stage. Mr. Sundaram, IAS, who inaugurated the concert, had come from Tuticorin. \u201cEnna saar paadarel?\u201d he asked. I said I was going to sing <i>Sree Mahaganapatim.</i> His response was instantaneous. \u201cI don\u2019t know about all that. Sing <i>Anandamritakarshini,</i> or I\u2019m leaving,\u201d he said. I obliged, sang with a lot of feeling. Everyone was happy. Sundaram took me to Tuticorin for lunch in his car and sent me back in the evening by car. As I entered Ettayapuram, it was raining cats and dogs. The temporary roof had been blown off. I told the organisers, \u201cDon\u2019t blame me or Sundaram. It\u2019s only a reminder for a permanent structure here.\u201d My singing the raga Amritavarshini had the same result again during my tour of the U.S.A. in 1982. At the end of a 30-day tour, it rained heavily after a sunny morning following my <i>Anandamritakarshini.</i> Of course, I have sung the song many other times with no change in the weather whatsoever!</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aMore memorable in a strictly musical sense was a concert in Washington during the same tour. It was the last concert of the trip. I sang <i>Janaki Ramana</i> elaborately with alapana, niraval and swaraprastara for more than an hour. I was quite pleased with my effort. As I was about to pack my tambura and leave the hall, two ladies approached me. \u201cThat was a lovely Suddha Seemantini. It reminded us of Naina Pillai.\u201d I was stunned. Ten thousand miles away from home, here were two women who had heard my guru Naina Pillai and who could tell Suddha Seemantini from Todi. I had gooseflesh. \u201cWhat more do I want amma?\u201d I said to the ladies.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a<div style="text-align: right;">(Concluded) </div></div></div>
