She has also performed in the USA and Canada.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aA direct \u2018B-High\u2019 grade artiste of the All India Radio, Bharathi was a recipient of the Best Female Vocalist Award for 2007 in the Spirit of Youth festival of the Music Academy, as well as the Government of India CCRT scholarship for vocal music during 1996-2004.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aAn active member of YACM (Youth Association for Classical Music), Bharathi has been the editor of its newsletter \u2018Dhwani\u2019. An alumna of P S Senior Secondary School and Stella Maris College, and a gold medallist in her Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Chemistry, Bharathi went on to pursue a research project in Bio-Organic Chemistry at the Center for Biotechnology, Anna University, Chennai, and her Masters in Biotechnological Law &amp; Ethics from the School of Law, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aIn a concert review in The Hindu, Gowri Ramnarayan said:</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a<i>Bharathi\u2019s very first piece, a Saranga varnam, was crisp but had the raga contours intact, against this natural soundscape</i> (of the Miraj tambura on stage).</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a<i>Brochevarevare (Sriranjani) established the appeal of a voice touched with a pleasing, husky timbre. Bharathi\u2019s choice was balanced, her approach emphasised the quality of grandeur. Sentimentality that lightens the load of even regal ragas was completely absent.</i></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a<i>Varali\u2019s appeal was maximised by generous akaram, which, in consonance with Bharathi\u2019s distinctive voice, assured connectivity.</i></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a<i>When she sang </i>Mamava Minakshi,<i> the reason for focussing on the majesty rather than the pathos of Varali became evident, authenticated by the fine niraval imaging the warrior goddess as Digvijayapratapin\u2019.</i></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000a<i>Bhairavi was delightful, more karvai strung, the holistic evolution missing no crucial prayoga.</i></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />\u000aThese words accurately describe Bharathi Ramasubban\u2019s chaste, tastefully rendered, nuanced vocalisation. With continued hard work and a consistent focus on her art, she can carve out a rewarding career for herself in the years to come.</span></div></div>
