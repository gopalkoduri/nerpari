V<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; text-align: justify;"><b>By&nbsp;Ganesh V</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><ul><li><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Stop by at these sabhas in Madras, for each one of them has something unique to offer you</span></li>\u000a</ul><blockquote class="tr_bq"><ul><li><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Music Academy \u2013 the place where it all started, 85 winters ago. The pre-eminent sabha in Madras; a rich sense of history. The digital archive here has several thousand hours of recorded music, including live concerts of many stalwarts. A must-do.</span></li>\u000a</ul></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><ul><li><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha \u2013 located in Triplicane, this is the oldest sabha in the city. Again, a rich sense of history. More than a century old.</span></li>\u000a</ul></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><ul><li><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Kalakshetra, near Besant Nagar \u2013 all performances are conducted in the koothambalam (a Malayalam word for \u2018performance arena\u2019). With its greenery, fresh air and open spaces, it transports you even before the music begins.</span></li>\u000a</ul></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><ul><li><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">The Mylapore Fine Arts Club \u2013 for its old-world ambience. The set-up is basic, yet very comfortable. This is how Carnatic music is actually meant to be imbibed. </span></li>\u000a</ul></blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><ul><li><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Vani Mahal (Sri Thyaga Brahma Gana Sabha), Sri Krishna Gana Sabha and Narada Gana Sabha \u2013 all of them offer an excellent line-up of musicians, comfortable seating and very good acoustic systems.</span></li>\u000a</ul></blockquote><ul><li><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Grab a copy of The Hindu\u2019s special supplement on 1st December&nbsp; and Kannan\u2019s booklet of concert schedules. Both are invaluable ready reckoners. Kannan\u2019s booklet is available at the Nalli Silk Store outlet adjacent to Panagal Park in T. Nagar and at his residence (which, I hope, can be traced through Google).</span></li>\u000a</ul><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><ul><li><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Pick out the artists you want to listen to or watch and look up their concert timings in advance. It pays to plan ahead for the next three or four days. </span></li>\u000a</ul><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><ul><li><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Try to attend at least one concert each of T.N. Krishnan (violin), R.K. Srikantan, R. Vedavalli, Parassala Ponnammal, Nedunuri Krishnamurthy (all vocal) and N. Ramani (flute). These are my favourites. They belong to the old guard and have been upholding traditional values and tenets of Carnatic music. Their music has a distinct old-world flavour, which I find charming. </span></li>\u000a</ul><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><ul><li><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Among the younger lot, don\u2019t miss U. Shrinivas (an absolute wizard with the mandolin), T.M. Krishna (vocal), Malladi Brothers (vocal), Sanjay Subrahmanyan (vocal) and Bombay Jayashri (vocal). </span></li>\u000a</ul><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><ul><li><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">At every sabha you visit, try to sample the culinary fare at the canteen. Trust me, you will rejoice! </span></li>\u000a</ul><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;"></span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><ul><li><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">Treat the traditional South Indian filter coffee with respect. The best way to show respect is to consume at least three cups of this heavenly brew everyday. </span></li>\u000a</ul><span style="font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif;">When in doubt, ask a local for directions to a particular locality or sabha. The denizens of Madras are friendly and more to the point, quite good with directions.</span></div></div>
