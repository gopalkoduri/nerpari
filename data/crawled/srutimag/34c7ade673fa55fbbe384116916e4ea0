His father M.R. Krishnamurthy has been a Bhagavata Mela artist for the past five decades. As is the tradition in these families, Srikanth was put through his first steps at a very young age, and has been on stage since the age of six, when he made his debut as Bhoomi Devi.

Every summer he joins the troupe which congregates at Melattur and he has now specialized in playing female lead roles in the natakam-s.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aHe learnt Bharatanatyam from guru Shanmugasundaram Pillai under whose baton he had his arangetram at Kumbakonam when he was 11. Relocating to Chennai to pursue higher studies, Srikanth graduated in Botany and secured a Masters in Public Administration. Meanwhile, he resumed his training in Bharatanatyam under guru Saraswati. He was put under the tutelage of Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam under whose guidance he emerged as a fine exponent of Bharatanrityam, a good teacher, choreographer and a versatile actor.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aRhythmic clarity even in fast passages, linear architecture of lines executed with poise and grace, abhinaya combining crispness and emotive depth with a mix of lokadharmi and natyadharmi, imaginative choreography, a good sense of timing, dancing marked by pauses and moments of silence, and an eye for aesthetics, are hallmarks of Srikanth\u2019s dance.
