Soon after the&nbsp; Arupathumoovar festival, the temple\u000aauthorities organised the Panguni Kalai Vizha which featured famous classical\u000amusicians and dancers. Encouraged by the&nbsp;\u000apublic response, the temple authorities, spearheaded by the Thakkar P.\u000aVijaykumar Reddy, have decided to conduct art festivals regularly at the ornate\u000aNavaratri Mandapam in the precincts of the temple. The Chithirai Kalai Vizha (18-25\u000aApril) opened with the dance-drama Venkatadri Vaibhavam choreographed by\u000anatyacharya Krishnakumari Narendran, and showcased&nbsp; \u201cgen-next\u201d musicians every evening. The Aani Isai Vizha is now on\u000aat the temple from 15 to 21 June, and features established young musicians.</span></i><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i>&nbsp;</i></span></span></div>\u000a<br />\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><i>Bharatanatyam exponent and yoga teacher </i><b>Jyotsna Narayanan<i> </i></b><i>shares her experience of\u000aattending concerts at the temple during the Panguni arts festival.</i></span></span></div>\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u000a</span></span>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aTA1xvPToUE/U6GF9ejSsOI/AAAAAAAAEfw/SL2Jr70BQB0/s1600/Panguni+-audience.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aTA1xvPToUE/U6GF9ejSsOI/AAAAAAAAEfw/SL2Jr70BQB0/s1600/Panguni+-audience.JPG" height="213" width="320" /></a></div>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">It is a fine line between atavism and recreating the\u000amagic of a time gone by. The organisers of the festival of dance and music at\u000athe Kapali temple in Mylapore, Vijaykumar Reddy and Preetha Reddy have walked\u000athis line with aesthetic care. Attending some of the concerts and taking in the\u000aambience, I got the feeling it was the right thing happening in the right place\u000a\u2013 a feeling of good <i>vaastu</i>! It evoked within me the simple grace of an\u000aunpretentious culture \u2013 where temples are organic centres of art, where art is\u000ainspired by divine quest, where the artist is a seeker, the common man a\u000arasika, and the patron is a true connoisseur.</span></span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Every evening, as I removed my footwear outside the\u000aentrance to the temple, bought some jasmine for my hair (the fragrance of\u000ajasmine is somehow more irresistible outside a temple!) and walked onto the\u000asmooth, cool, stone courtyard, I could feel the classical strains of music fill\u000athe night, fill the large courtyard, fill my ears. And as I walked around the\u000asanctum in the traditional clockwise direction (there was no rush to grab a\u000avacant seat, we were, after all, in a temple!) the music filled my heart. It\u000awasn\u2019t so much who was singing but what was being sung.</span></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">And day after day there were so many people, a\u000apacked audience. There were people sitting everywhere \u2013 on the floor in small\u000agroups, leaning against the beautifully engraved pillars, on the many steps\u000athat line the various precincts of the temple, on the odd bench. Younger people\u000a(those with less grey hair) gave up their sitting place to the elderly who\u000amoved closer together on their step to fit in another. Mothers brought their\u000atoddlers who happily played under the night sky and a father brought his\u000adisabled son everyday in a wheelchair. There were friends and neighbours in\u000asimple cotton sarees and veshtis with perhaps the odd salwar kameez and pant.\u000aEveryday people in everyday clothes. It wasn\u2019t the Kancheepuram silk parade of\u000athe sabhas!</span></span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XJJ-tNK-Z8I/U6GGVUi7I-I/AAAAAAAAEf4/fV39Jug_-SI/s1600/Panguni+-+Blog+-+Bombay+Jayashri.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XJJ-tNK-Z8I/U6GGVUi7I-I/AAAAAAAAEf4/fV39Jug_-SI/s1600/Panguni+-+Blog+-+Bombay+Jayashri.JPG" height="214" width="320" /></a></div>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Everyone was soaking it in. Devotees perambulating\u000athe sanctum muttering some mantras under their breath were unconsciously\u000akeeping talam with their fingers. The priests who were done with their duties\u000aof the day stood by, leisurely taking in the graceful dancing; even the\u000arickshaw puller on the road tells you as you enter the temple: \u201cToday Bombay\u000aJayashri is singing \u2026. Full crowd.\u201d On another day, my flower seller told me\u000a\u201cYou can pay me later. They are playing the tani<i> </i>avartanam already, you\u000aare late. Go in soon.\u201d Even the sudden clanging of the temple bells to mark the\u000aevening rituals did not seem to disturb the rhythm. The musicians (sometimes at\u000athe high point of his or her niraval)&nbsp;\u000aoften paused gracefully (even as many in the audience subconsciously\u000ajoined their palms in namaskaram) only to begin exactly where they had left off\u000aas soon as the bells ceased.</span></span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">In this temple festival the music, the musician, the\u000aaudience and the ritual were all linked, it seems, by religiosity rather than\u000areligion. There was space (literally and otherwise) for old acquaintances to\u000acatch up quietly, there was space to enter in the middle of the main piece,\u000alisten for a while and leave in the middle of the tani. There was space for the\u000aconnoisseur to sit in a far corner and feel like a common man. But more\u000aimportantly, there was the space for the common man to feel like a connoisseur.\u000aIsn\u2019t that then the spirit of all art?</span></span></div>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"></span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">\u000a\u000a</span></span></div>\u000a
