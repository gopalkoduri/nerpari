In its Hindustani adaptation, it has the tone material of raga Yaman with a flat (komal) <i>Ni</i> replacing the natural (suddha).</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><i>Arohana: S R G M P D n S<br />Avarohana: S n D P M G R S</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />By Hindustani raga grammar, this has been interpreted as the Kalyan parent-scale in the lower tetrachord and the Kafi parent-scale in the upper tetrachord. For Hindustani musicians, Yaman is the most logical reference point for Vachaspati because, strictly in scalar terms, replacing the suddha <i>Ni</i> of Yaman with a komal <i>Ni</i> delivers the Vachaspati scale. But, the issue is a little more complicated.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The most important aspect of the Yaman-to-Vachaspati transformation is the disappearance of the <i>Ga-Ni</i> axis in first-fifth correspondence. Without the suddha <i>Ni,</i> the new raga has to find an alternative axis to revolve around. The treatment of the raga by Hindustani musicians tends to explore several alternatives (<i>Re-Pa, Ga-Dha</i> and <i>Ma-ni</i>), without being able to settle down with any of them. Such experimental uncertainty is evident in the Vachaspati renderings of musicians of even great stature, as it reflects the current stage of evolution of the raga in the Hindustani system.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />From readily available references, it appears that Pandit Ravi Shankar\u2019s interpretation of Vachaspati is academic, precisely according to its scale. He did not omit <i>Re</i> and <i>Dha</i> in the ascent, as some Hindustani musicians have tended to do. As a result, the lower tetrachord remains close to the Yaman, and the upper tetrachord avoids proximity to the Gavati/ Kalavati flavour. The melodic centre of gravity remains in the mid-octave region, where the two scales coalesce. Interestingly, and probably to accommodate a suggestion of the Carnatic style of intonation, Panditji occasionally used a subliminal touch of flat (komal) <i>Ga</i> along with the natural (suddha) <i>Ga</i> and natural (suddha) <i>Ni</i> along with <i>Sa.</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Shivkumar Sharma (<i>Santoor.</i> EMI/HMV: STCS:04B:7375) omits the <i>Re</i> tone in the ascent and frequently omits the sharp (teevra) <i>Ma</i> from the descent.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Ascent: <i>S-G-M-P-D-n-S</i> <br />Descent: <i>S-n-D-P-M-G-R-S or S-n-D-P-G-R-S).</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Vocalist, Jagdish Prasad (unpublished) omits <i>Re</i> as well as <i>Dha</i> from the ascent.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Ascent: <i>S-G-M-P-n-S</i><br />Descent: <i>S-n-D-P-M-G-R-S</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Ustad Amir Khan, who too had a penchant for Carnatic ragas (such as Hamsadhwani, Charukesi, Basant Mukhari/ Vakulabharanam), recorded an untitled and self-composed raga (INRECO: LP: 2411-0001,1982), which appears to be his interpretation of Vachaspati. Why he left it untitled is a mystery. In this raga, he omits <i>Re</i> and <i>Dha</i> from the ascent, and <i>Dha</i> from the descent.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Ascent: <i>S-G-M-P-n-S</i> <br />Descent: <i>S-n-P-M-G-R-S</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />His treatment of the Re tone in the descent is fleeting or summary.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Amarnath Mishra, a Benares based sitarist, trained by a leading sarangi exponent (published by India Archive Music, New York) conforms to the version which omits <i>Re</i> in the ascent. In addition, he uses melodic features of Saraswati, an allied raga which includes <i>Re,</i> but omits <i>Ga</i> in the ascent and descent (tone material: <i>S R M P D n</i>). Mishra\u2019s inclusion of phrases such as <i>S-R-M-R</i> and <i>S-R-M-P,</i> along with the characteristic <i>M-P-M-R,</i> incorporates the Saraswati identity.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Vachaspati is increasingly becoming familiar to Hindustani audiences by its chalan or distinctive phraesology. This chalan itself is fluid because of the recency of the raga\u2019s introduction into Hindustani music and the handful of musicians of stature who have worked on shaping its distinctive melodic identity. The variance extends to the predominant mood of the raga, with renditions ranging from the profound to the vivacious and, of course, some which oscillate in between.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The transformation of Carnatic ragas into Hindustani melodic entities has been an uneven process. While some ragas like Abhogi, Hamsadhwani, and Keeravani have acquired a stable Hindustani identity reasonably fast, several others are unstable several decades after their introduction. Under such conditions, every musician playing these ragas risks confusion in the audience mind by calling his interpretation by the same Carnatic name. In addition, he also risks the disapproval of those Carnatic-oriented audiences, who might find themselves uncomfortable with all Hindustani treatments in general.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><b>Chandni Kalyan \u2013 an alternative name</b></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pwoj3dqb69o/UihXZRH1mDI/AAAAAAAADsY/a59Q0gxGllo/s1600/shiv_kumar_sharma.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pwoj3dqb69o/UihXZRH1mDI/AAAAAAAADsY/a59Q0gxGllo/s320/shiv_kumar_sharma.jpg" width="274" /></a></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">This assessment of the risks probably persuaded sitar maestro Vilayat Khan, in the 1970s, to coin a new name \u201cChandni Kalyan\u201d for Vachaspati. The word \u201cKalyan\u201d establishes the raga\u2019s anchoring in the Kalyan parent scale, and its affinity to Yaman, the main raga of the Kalyan scale. The prefix \u201cChandni\u201d alludes to the precedent of Chandni Kedar which comes into being by replacing the suddha <i>Ni</i> of Kedar with a komal <i>Ni.</i> Yaman Kalyan undergoes an identical transformation in Chandni Kalyan. The prefix was, therefore, considered appropriate.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Though Vachaspati is known to a large number of music lovers, familiarity with the Chandni Kalyan coinage is still restricted to Vilayat Khan\u2019s audiences. Its logic could, however, assure wider usage for the name, if the raga itself becomes more popular.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Musicologists have often argued that Hindustani music tends to adopt merely the scales of Carnatic ragas, without concerning itself with the totality of their raga-ness. The musical approaches of the two traditions are so distinct that a cross-cultural transformation acceptable to both traditions may be impossible. The Hindustani tradition does, however, attempt to achieve a stable melodic personality for each adopted raga which may, or may not, appear satisfactory to aficionados of Carnatic music. The maturation of these personalities requires several musicians of great stature to devote their musical energies to the process. Until this happens, Hindustani as well as Carnatic audiences will perceive these transformations as awkward in their raga-ness.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Chandni Kalyan/ Vachaspati might still be at this half-baked stage of raga-ness in the Hindustani tradition. Its authoritative grammar will be written only after its literature has matured. Until then, each musician\u2019s interpretation of it must be accepted on its own terms, and judged only on its distinctiveness and aesthetic coherence.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>Deepak S.
