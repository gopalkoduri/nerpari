(The Pancharatna kritis referred to here are a suite of five songs of saint-composer <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja (1767-1847).</a></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Marquesee is modest when he speaks of his credentials to write on Carnatic music, but his insights are brilliantly direct and praiseworthy in a westerner attracted to but hardly expert in it. He says of Carnatic music, \u201cIts history is a history of innovation and broken taboos\u2014relating to gender and caste, public and private. The kutcheri as we know it dates only from <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music.html" target="_blank">Ariyakudi</a> (Ramanuja Iyengar, a famous vocalist) and the 1930s. In a single evening it can include compositions with lyrics in Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, Kannada, Marathi and Hindi. I can\u2019t think of another musical culture with a comparable spread.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Closer home, VS Narasimhan, an accomplished western classical violinist who has pioneered the performance of the great Carnatic music compositions by western musicians\u2014his own Madras String Quartet\u2014dreams of being around when symphony orchestras in Europe and America perform the masterpieces of <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja</a> and other south Indian composers.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />On 13 May 2012, the California-based Sacramento Youth Symphony (SYS) Orchestra collaborated with Chitravina Ravikiran to play a <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_19.html" target="_blank">Tyagaraja</a> composition rearranged for the orchestra.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to one report, \u201cThe repertoire, carefully chosen by conductor Michael Neumann, kept the Indian spirit even in traditional Western pieces such as <i>The Crown of India</i> suite by Edward Elgar and Kromsky\u2019s Song <i>of India.\u201d</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><i>If silence was golden<br />You couldn\u2019t raise a dime <br />Because your mind is on vacation <br />And you mouth is working overtime</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Versatile musician Stan Scott may not remember belting out this jazz blues number at a Mylapore home some 25 years ago, but I was in the audience during that magical jam session in which another American musician-researcher Mathew Harp (yes, Harp) Allen played an equally active part.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The day Dr. Scott arrived at Calcutta one day in the 1970s, he received the shocking news of the death of the guru he had come all the way from the USA to learn Hindustani music from. Earlier in the US, he had learnt vocal music from sarod maestro <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_24.html" target="_blank">Ali Akbar Khan</a> and Sushil Mukherjee, director of fine arts at a Massachusetts school. In India, his tutelage included lessons from gurus like Krishna Chandra Banerjee, Sugata Marjit and Mohan Singh (at Santi Niketan) in classical music, and Kali Das Gupta in folk music. His stint with Vidyadhar Vyas at Wesleyan University trained him in the Gwalior gharana (in addition to the Agra gharana he had already learnt) and led him to his PhD in Hindustani classical singing.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Matthew Allen came to Chennai to learn padam singing from the family of T Balasaraswati\u2014Bala to her admirers in two continents\u2014descendant of the redoubtable Veenai Dhanammal. Like Stan Scott, he too was already a trained musician in a western genre before he ventured into learning the complex art of Indian classical music; he did so well enough to co-author a book on south Indian music with Bala\u2019s brother, the incomparable flautist <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_11.html" target="_blank">T. Viswanathan,</a> who headed the ethnomusicology department at Wesleyan University, Connecticut. Allen has also written on padams and other dance music of south India as well as the recent history of bharatanatyam.&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />It was with Jon Higgins that <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/07/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_11.html" target="_blank">T. Viswanathan</a> entered into his most enduring, productive collaboration. Born in Andover, Massachusetts, Higgins, a western classical vocalist who completed a double major in Music and History in 1962 and an M.A. in Musicology in 1964, from Wesleyan, earned a Ph.D. in Ethnomusicology in 1973.&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />He founded the Indian music studies program at York University in Toronto with mridanga vidwan Trichy Sankaran in 1971, and returned to Wesleyan in 1978 as a professor of music and director of the center for the arts. Higgins had attended several concerts of Sankaran\u2019s with <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-of-indian-classical-music.html" target="_blank">Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer,</a> and seen him teach an American student of Viswa.&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Sankaran had earlier turned down an invitation from American mridanga student Robert Brown\u2014who will figure later in this narrative\u2014to join Wesleyan University as a research scholar.&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Sankaran was apprehensive about making any long-term commitment in view of his family responsibilities and fearful of jeopardizing a flourishing concert career in Madras. \u201cI told Jon I would go only for a year or two. The rest is history!\u201d remembers Sankaran, who has since made York University and Toronto his home, visiting Chennai annually during the music season, to perform, teach and do lecture-demonstrations.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Viswa studied ethnomusicology at UCLA on a Fulbright scholarship from 1958 to 1960, and headed the Department of Music at Madras University from 1961 to 1966. He taught at UCLA and the California Institute of the Arts before joining the Wesleyan faculty in 1975, and earning his Ph.D. there. Training under Viswa, Higgins became the first non-Indian to perform South Indian classical Carnatic music at a high level of proficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Higgins continued his studies under Bala and wrote his dissertation on the dance music of bharatanatyam, returning to India as a Senior Research Fellow of the American Institute of Indian Studies, and making a name for himself in Carnatic music as <i>Higgins Bhagavatar</i> (A bhagavatar is an accomplished musician).&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Born in Rising Star, Texas, USA, in 1935, David Reck, a child prodigy in Western music, is a familiar figure in Carnatic music circles at Chennai. A Fellow at the Princeton Seminars in Advanced Musical Studies in the late 1950s, he pursued a successful career in New York as a composer with performances at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Town Hall, and Tanglewood. Drawn to Indian classical music and dance by the concerts of Ravi Shankar, <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/05/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_24.html" target="_blank">Ali Akbar Khan,</a> <a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/06/whos-who-in-indian-classical-music_04.html" target="_blank">K.V. Narayanaswamy,</a> Palghat Raghu, and others, he studied Indian philosophy, yoga, and Sanskrit.&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Coming to India in 1968 through a grant from the Rockefeller Arts Foundation, David and his wife, photographer Carol Reck, moved to Chennai, a life-changing decision. David studied Carnatic music theory and practice, specializing in playing the veena, an ancient string instrument\u2014learning from Kalpakam Swaminathan among others\u2014at the Central College of Carnatic Music.&nbsp;</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />David Reck returned to the United States in 1971, earning a Ph.D. in World Music from Wesleyan University, and joining the faculty of Amherst College as professor of Music and Asian Studies.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />David Reck continued veena lessons in the US with Karaikudi S. Subramanian and in 1991 became a student of Ranganayaki Rajagopalan, a disciple of Karaikudi Sambasiva Iyer, Subramanian\u2019s grandfather and \u2018founder\u2019 of the Karaikudi bani or school of veena music, under a grant from the American Institute of Indian Studies. He comes to Chennai regularly for veena practice as well as performances on the concert circuit, including kutcheris at the Music Academy. He is a well-known author of books and articles on Carnatic music.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />A survivor from cancer and a heart attack, Reck believes in the healing qualities of Carnatic music and the veena.</span><br />\u000a<br />\u000a<div style="text-align: right;">\u000a<b><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">(<a href="http://srutimag.blogspot.in/2012/09/connecticut-yankees-in-carnatic-music_26.html" target="_blank">To be continued</a>)</span></b></div>\u000a</div>\u000a</div>\u000a
