If the Malladi Brothers\u2019 robust concert at 4.15 pm was a sell-out, Ravikiran\u2019s was \u2018smooth sailing,\u2019 anchored on aesthetics.<br />\u000a<br />\u000a</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kRRtsFTzV-8/TvLoTKj9ILI/AAAAAAAAAMo/E8C8TfRTwvE/s1600/Season-Academy-Ravikiran.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kRRtsFTzV-8/TvLoTKj9ILI/AAAAAAAAAMo/E8C8TfRTwvE/s320/Season-Academy-Ravikiran.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;">It was a fine occasion for the connoisseurs to savour Sankaran\u2019s \u2018unhurried and traditional strokes\u2019 on a precisely tuned mridangam for the wonderful 5-kattai pitch of the chitraveena. Ravikiran dedicated the main kriti Paramatmudu (Vagadeeswari) to the Sangita Kalanidhi designate. It was for this kriti that Sankaran as a lad of 13 years had played his maiden <i>tani</i> during a concert of the Alathur Brothers. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSankaran demonstrated the Palani sampradaya throughout his solo (with K.V. Gopalakrishnan on the khanjira). The perattukai/ mohra was aesthetic. For the \u2018lightning RTP\u2019 (as described by Ravikiran) in Saveri - Sankeerna triputa also, the Professor did a wind-up mohra as a fitting finale. KVG followed devoutly on the khanjira.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aIf at all there was a pace-maker in the menu, it was Pavanaguru (Hamsanandi) for which Ravikiran rendered some swaras in ati tara sthayi\u2014something he rarely does. (Perhaps I was listening to the prayoga-s for the first time). However it went down well with the audience.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe core composition (going by the \u2018difficulty index\u2019) was an Oothukadu kriti in Manji\u2014the varnamettu of which does not extend beyond the madhya sthayi (Ravikiran does not fail to announce such specialties for the benefit of the audience if not the critics). Thank Lord Rajagopala, it was only in Adi tala but enough to explain the amount of homework necessary to internalise such kriti-s.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aListen to a song in madhyama sruti on the chitraveena and you\u2019ll be overjoyed. \u2018Sakhiprana\u2019\u2014the celebrated javali in Chenchuritti\u2014was pleasant and with that Ravikiran concluded the concert.</div></div>
