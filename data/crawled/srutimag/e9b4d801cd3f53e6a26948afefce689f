That of a project editor in Oxford University Press, of course. Stands to reason, doesn\u2019t it?</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />That was Nivedita Narayanan\u2019s choice of day job when she graduated from business school a couple of years ago, though we at Sruti tried to tempt her to join us as a correspondent. As we were aware of her background as a musician, TV anchor and freelance journalist with a reputation for meeting deadlines without fail, we were quite surprised with her decision to become an editor, though her all round qualifications should have really prepared us.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Nivedita started learning Carnatic music at the age of 14 from prominent Carnatic vocalist KN Shashikiran, to whose mentoring she attributes both her musical proficiency and theoretical knowledge. She says, \u201cWhen I went to Shashi sir, I had already learnt for seven years, but I could barely identify <i>swarasthanas</i> and disliked Carnatic music to the extent of hating it.\u201d She has also been the popular hostess of such TV shows as <i>Puduppunal</i> and <i>Nam Virundinar</i> on Podhigai TV, <i>Maithreem Bhajatha</i> on Sankara TV and Doordarshan\u2019s National Programme of Music.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Nivedita who has had a brilliant academic record\u2014has received awards for outstanding performance in school board examinations, a gold medal in her BE (Electrical and Electronics Engineering) from Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering and best outgoing student awards for all semesters in both her engineering course and MBA (Finance) from the ICFAI Business School.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<br /></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Nivedita has been contributing interviews and articles for Sruti magazine for the past few years. Her writing is thoughtful and well structured.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
