No wonder our own GNB, Palghat Mani Iyer, Palani Subramaniam Pillai and Rajamanickam Pillai were collectively nicknamed <i>Mummaniyum manikkamum! </i></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aMany composers have painted dazzling visuals of their <i>ishta devatas</i> as <i>marakatavarna</i> (emerald-hued), <i>ratnabharanadhara</i> (bedecked in jewels), <i>manimantapasthita</i> (enshrined in a bejewelled mantapa). We see sheer magnificence in <i>Hiranmanyim lakshmim.</i> Our minds are filled with grandeur and beauty when we hear Papanasam Sivan\u2019s description of the majestic Adhikara-nandi (<i>Kana kankodi</i>) or Bharatiyar\u2019s reference to stars adorning Kannamma\u2019s inky blue sari (<i>Suttum vizhichudar</i>), or the little Krishna\u2019s cradle decorated with diamond trinkets (<i>Manikkam katti</i>). </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSumitra Vasudev\u2019s Oli chamber concert explored this celestial splendour enshrined in classical Carnatic music. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b>That Deep Inner Glow</b></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aAs I entered Rasvihar-Sarangi (Nungambakkam), routine dragged my feet to the stairs that would take me to their lovely silk sari collection. But I was here for an entirely different purpose. The furniture in one of the inner rooms on the lower level was being re-arranged to accommodate an audience of about 40 persons (finally 60 persons turned up!). Most of the rasikas arrived much before the artistes for the evening, and taught the Oli Team yet another lesson in concert organizing: make sure the artistes get tuned in well on time. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aSoon leaflets were distributed, lost listeners circumambulating Loyola College found their way to the hall, wires tripped on, missing speech notes recovered, mobile phones switched off and prayer sung (what else but a tevaram about <i><b>Oli</b></i>!) and Sumitra Vasudev began her concert. What I believed until now to be merely a pleasant space turned out to be acoustically sound as well. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aFirst up was a veritable tongue twister of alliterative prose (<i>Jayatu jayatu</i>), which Sumitra sang with consummate ease. In this <i>churnika,</i> Tyagarajasvami, with almost breathless awe, describes Narada\u2019s vision of Vaikuntha with all its opulence. The beautiful <i>sahitya</i> caressed by the lilting notes of Arabhi, Mohanam and Varali made for a piquant opener. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aIt was all emerald and gold in quick succession with <i>Marakatamanivarna</i> and <i>Hiranmayim lakshmim.</i> Then, unfolding layer after layer of Anandabhairavi (with a viruttam <i>Valliyai uyirtta</i> on Sita) Sumitra moved seamlessly onto an imposing Kedaragoulai and Saveri, all of which were gems themselves. Despite the fact that the voice betrayed some tiredness, especially in higher sancharas, it was obvious that the vocalist had steeped herself in a tradition where <i>gnanabalam</i> reinforced <i>bhavasukham,</i> sahityam enhanced sangitam, and tenderness matched strength. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe viruttam brought to the fore Kamban\u2019s striking image. A bashful bride-to-be, Sita walks towards the golden wedding <i>mantapa.</i> The lustrous floor of the <i>mantapa,</i> reflecting Sita\u2019s emerald-studded anklets, transforms into a bed of grass put forth by Bhoomi devi for her beloved daughter, lest her feet should hurt walking on this cold, hard albeit golden floor. Arunachala Kavi, inspired by Kamban, incorporates the same imagery into his song <i>Annai janaki</i> (Saveri). And Sumitra in her turn sought to evoke some deep inner glow with her iridescent classicism.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe audience was visibly excited when Kambhoji was launched, as though well aware of the treat they were in for. Sumitra had allotted herself a substantial amount of time to do justice to both raga and the kriti (<i>Kana kankodi vendum</i>). I felt a little cheated when she plunged straight into <i>svara</i>-exchanges, eschewing <i>niraval</i> at the grand <i>\u2018manikkam vairam\u2019</i> line. But my brooding was short-lived since Sumitra made up by opening the floodgates of <i>svaraprastara,</i> not only alternating between <i>manikkam</i> and <i>vairam,</i> but also creating unexpected glides, odukkal and tempo patterns. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aMahakavi Bharatiyar\u2019s <i>Suttum vizhichudar</i> is perhaps one of the most flattering expositions of love a <i>nayika</i> could ever ask for. This ode to that celestial beauty, Kannamma, sung as a ragamalika <i>viruttam</i> where the vocalist showed her feel for poetry by playing on the words which enabled her to melodise in haunting ways. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aThe end of the concert came all too abruptly. K V Gopalakrishnan was all geared up to play a final flourish before he could rush for his bus to Madurai but Sumitra, for reasons we may never know, chose to end with a <i>slokam</i> in Surati. </div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000aM Rajeev and KV Gopalakrishnan did their best to accommodate themselves to a different flow of imagination and choice of items where they had less to do.</div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b>VIVADI</b></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b>The Artistes</b></div><div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<b>Sumitra Vasudev,</b> a foremost disciple of <i>Vidushi</i> R Vedavalli, is known for her thought-provoking music steeped in classicism.
