Subramanyam, the musician known to all as TRS. His 84 years did not\u000adim his zest for life, cheerfulness and spontaneity. Crippled physically by age\u000aand a stroke, and having undergone hip replacement surgery, he could still be\u000aseen almost every day in a concert hall in the city. The performer in the\u000aconcert might be a novice but at the end of the programme he or she would\u000areceive warm appreciation from him. Most youngsters he listened to were not\u000aknown to him personally, but this did not matter to him in the least. A few\u000aselect rasikas and I have shared the first row in sabhas with him on many\u000aoccasions and his standard joke was <i>\u201cInda row mahanubhavulu\u201d </i>(this row\u000ais for greats). </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">It is difficult to find another person with his warmth and\u000agenerosity. Many are the Carnatic musicians he introduced in the north during\u000ahis long innings in Delhi University.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">His style of music was intellectual rather than aesthetic, a\u000adeparture from the established tradition in Carnatic music. His batchmates of\u000athe Central College of Carnatic Music like the late T.K. Govinda Rao, Bombay\u000aRamachandran and S.R. Janakiraman have said that, ever a maverick and a rebel,\u000ahe was the first to ask questions and indulge in discussions with renowned\u000aprofessors of the time like Musiri Subramania Iyer, Tirupamburam Swaminatha\u000aPillai and T. Brinda. Those days a disciple was expected to be meek and\u000asilent \u2013 to keep his ears open and mouth shut. TRS was a free spirit then as he\u000awas later in life.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">From his student days, TRS was adept in creating pallavis in\u000adifferent talas and nadais. The korvais that he sang during the kalpanaswaras\u000aalso were very complex arithmetically. No mridanga vidwan could take his\u000aconcerts with TRS lightly. </span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">The first time I heard him was in mid 1971 when I was posted in\u000aMadras. He was a very popular vocalist then and even a very conservative sabha\u000alike Nadopasana, relaxed its rules to feature his concerts frequently. The\u000afirst concert I attended swept me off my feet, especially his rendering of what\u000ais now called \u2018poruttam\u2019 \u2013 singing a cluster of swaraprastaras to match that of\u000athe \u2018eduppu\u2019. Intellectually, this exercise was stimulating. Unfortunately\u000aalmost all young vidwans started copying this indiscriminately and it has since\u000abecome stale and artificial. And the irony is that many mridangists have </span><span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">taken to this, at times\u000aeven goading the main artist to join in the fun.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">My\u000aacquaintance with him in 1971 soon turned into friendship. In 1978, I was\u000aposted to Lucknow and TRS was a professor of music in Delhi University. In\u000aDelhi, he was closely associated with local sabhas and was primarily\u000aresponsible for arranging programmes of artists from elsewhere. As we had a\u000ahealthy population of south Indian families and a music sabha in Lucknow, we\u000amade use of TRS\u2019s services to get artists coming to Delhi to&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">also\u000apresent concerts in Lucknow. This arrangement considerably reduced our\u000aoverheads. In the five years I was in Lucknow and three years in Delhi\u000athereafter, we were able to arrange concerts of leading artists like Dr. S.\u000aRamanathan, D.K. Jayaraman, S. Kalyanaraman, V.R. Krishnan, K.V. Narayanaswamy,\u000aNedunuri Krishnamurthy, Nookala Chinna Sathyanarayana and others. TRS himself\u000abecame our \u2018asthana vidwan\u2019 and gave many concerts in Lucknow. He never\u000ahankered after money and gracefully accepted whatever remuneration we could\u000aarrange for him. This policy he followed with other sabhas too \u2013 a rare\u000aquality.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">TRS\u000asang for the mridangam arangetram of my son Ashok in 1982 and during the past\u000afive years, he attended the arangetram of all my disciples in Chennai; he was a\u000achief guest on one occasion.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">Wherever\u000aTRS was stationed \u2013 Andhra, Delhi or Chennai \u2013 he launched music sabhas and\u000aprovided opportunities to not-so-well-known musicians. The Music Education\u000aTrust that he started in Chennai featured artists not only from Chennai but\u000aelsewhere too including those based abroad. He was much sought after and\u000ainvited often to music workshops and social functions. At various times, he was\u000aa member of Prasar Bharati\u2019s audition board, and a judge in music competitions\u000aheld by major institutions like the Music Academy, and served as examiner in\u000amany universities.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">An\u000aunsavoury incident happened in his life some twenty years ago. <i>Sruti </i>magazine\u000acame across the manuscript of a thesis on music by a disciple of TRS, and\u000aexcerpts from it were quoted selectively and extensively in its November 1991\u000aissue. On the basis of these extracts, the thesis appeared to be poor in\u000acontent, research, language and execution; the sole source of information was\u000aTRS himself. It had a number of unsubstantiated observations on music\u000apersonalities. It had concluded that TRS was an epoch maker of the century!\u000aUnfortunately, a majority of&nbsp; Ph.D,\u000atheses I have come across are of very poor quality with the guide\u2019s aim being\u000athe number of \u2018scholars\u2019 they have mentored in their time. If it was the\u000aobjective of <i>Sruti </i>to expose the poor quality of theses, it was certainly\u000ajustified in doing so; but this \u2018expose\u2019 was presented in a very elaborate\u000amanner. In any case, the thesis was yet to be published. The language used was\u000aextremely harsh and the comments on various points in the thesis, overly\u000asarcastic. A hysteria built up after the <i>Sruti </i>issue came out and\u000avidwans and readers, went hammer and tongs at TRS in a \u2018holier than thou\u2019\u000aspirit. Sabhas boycotted TRS and his concerts in Chennai were cancelled. Under\u000athe circumstances, <i>Sruti </i>could have adopted an objective role to cool\u000atempers; on the other hand, it added fuel to fire. Some of us connected with <i>Sruti\u000a</i>tried to calm things down but to no avail.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">TRS\u000awas among the first to subscribe to <i>Sruti </i>when it was launched thirty\u000ayears ago. He asked many of his friends to subscribe to the magazine and I, as\u000aone of them, did so almost immediately. He took all the criticism by <i>Sruti </i>and\u000aothers with amazing equanimity. He was deeply hurt but did not comment on it in\u000apublic. He did not cut off his subscription to <i>Sruti </i>in anger but\u000acontinued to read it till the very end. That was TRS.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><b><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia;">TK\u000aVenkatasubramanian</span></b></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText3">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--vzAvtMriNw/UnOanQpAHzI/AAAAAAAAD4I/sRyGxnrUCMs/s1600/tkv.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="172" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--vzAvtMriNw/UnOanQpAHzI/AAAAAAAAD4I/sRyGxnrUCMs/s200/tkv.jpg" width="200" /></a></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText3">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">The relationship I shared with TRS was a special one \u2013\u000adeep respect for a scholarly musician, a sincere appreciation for an all giving\u000aguru and an honest liking for a wonderful human being. In short, TRS the man\u000aand TRS the musician were complementary and a rare blend.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">Bangalore K. Venkataram once called TRS an \u2018ashtavadhani\u2019 in music\u000a\u2013 because TRS was a gayaka with a bani of his own, a bodhaka for several\u000astudents, a lekhaka, an upanyasaka, a sastragnya, a nirvahaka, a nirdesaka and\u000aa vaggeyakara of good pedigree. The novelty of his bani drew rasikas as well as\u000agave food for thought to a serious student of music. One had to delve deep into\u000athe intricacies of music to understand his approach.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">The musical style of TRS was innovative. His performance was\u000aalways based on robust fundamentals. Rhythmic dominance did condition his\u000arendition. TRS treaded a path laid and determined by himself. It was at once conventional and unconventional. As a master of many musical forms\u000ahe indulged in endless experimentation striving to strike a judicious balance\u000abetween swara and laya. Subbudu referred to TRS as an embodiment of Tala, Raga\u000aand Swara (TRS). TRS was indeed a maestro with a difference, because the\u000aimpressions of his preceptors pale into insignificance when contrasted with his\u000aindividualism.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">Over the years TRS evolved a style combining various ideas in\u000avogue in the yester generation. His familiarity with the language of a\u000aparticular composition enabled him to bring out the bhava without any \u2018pada\u000achhedam\u2019. His ability to weave considerable intricacies in his concert\u000aqualified him to be described as a \u2018musician\u2019s musician\u2019. His forte was, of\u000acourse, pallavi singing. He relieved pallavi singing from cumbersome\u000aformalities inherited from previous generations to make it a pleasant\u000aexperience. His nadai pallavis were very complex and musically rich. TRS had\u000athe ability to construct a pallavi on the spot and execute with aplomb. TRS had\u000athe expertise to improvise and explore new vistas. He was an original thinker\u000aand represented the new generation of the \u2018GNB style\u2019.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">Some musicians and critics hold the view that Prof. T.R.\u000aSubrahmanyam\u2019s music was cerebral and not soulful. TRS himself never made any\u000apretensions of reaching spiritual levels. His music contained all the\u000aingredients that could make a concert successful, namely a strident voice,\u000acomfortable both in lower and higher octaves, total control over laya,\u000aimpressive alapanas and swarams. His concerts were object lessons for budding\u000amusicians. I wish to record that TRS has been encouraging a lot of young\u000aartists. He was always on wheels to promote the art and spotted new talent. The\u000ahelping had of TRS has been beneficially felt by every organization connected\u000awith music, in India and abroad.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">In a one-on-one discussion, I raised the question whether music\u000awas for the mind or for the heart. TRS assumed the role of samsodaka and drew\u000amy attention to Sarangadeva\u2019s statement that music is the self-motivated\u000amanifestation of latent thought \u2013 <i>\u201cAatma vivakohamano\u2026\u2026\u2026. Aavirbhaavayate\u000adhwanim\u201d</i>. He went on to explain that both thought and emotions condition\u000athe musical output and that is also the definition of manodharma. For him,\u000amanodharma was a symbol of freedom of thought and expression, which permits\u000aadequate scope for creative and innovative expressions of an artist. In this\u000aexperimentation there should not be any fetters from the past (tradition!!).\u000aAccording to TRS, such freedom was unlimited but required regulation only. A\u000adelicate balance between lakshana (theory) and lakshya (practice) was to be\u000astruck. Unfortunately, there are no guidelines to achieve that balance and\u000athere is a lot of disagreement when it comes to optimising aesthetic satisfaction\u000aand excellence.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">TRS was convinced that manodharma sangeetam was an edifice built\u000aon kalpita sangeetam. He was the undisputed master of that manodharma. Raga\u000aalapana, swara kalpana, tanam, niraval and pallavi are all dimensions of that</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">manodharma.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"></span></div>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia;"> Umayalapuram K Sivaraman</span></b></span><br />\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><b><span style="font-family: Georgia;">&nbsp;</span>\u000a\u000a</b></span><br />\u000a<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SxqZKsrGBms/UnObLWITUhI/AAAAAAAAD4Q/9OBm7BJoKD0/s1600/uks.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SxqZKsrGBms/UnObLWITUhI/AAAAAAAAD4Q/9OBm7BJoKD0/s1600/uks.jpg" /></a></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><b>\u000a\u000a</b></span><br />\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">M</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">aha Mahopadhyaya Sangeeta Vidwan T.R.

His\u000aswaraprastaras were novel, unpredictable. When I could reproduce the phrases he\u000asang, he would spontaneously appreciate me on the stage.

There are very few who have such mastery over the pallavi. He\u000abrought in many music ideas into pallavi singing. He was not a traditionalist\u000abut did not break from tradition. He introduced niraval during ragamalika\u000arenditions in pallavis. He practised the proper way of singing tanam. His\u000asinging appeared simple, but was quite intricate, very much like Lalgudi\u2019s scheme. He took\u000agreat pleasure in teaching.

Subramanyam (TRS Mama to me) in 1991, when\u000amy family, then based in Toronto, Canada, made a trip to Pittsburgh, U.S.A., to\u000avisit the Balaji temple there. To my mother Vasundhra Rajagopal\u2019s surprise, she\u000asaw TRS Mama, her old mentor and guru from Delhi, at the temple. He asked me to\u000asing for him and I sang the kriti <i>Siddhi Vinayakam </i>in Mohanakalyani.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="color: black; font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">TRS then informed us that he had come to teach at the temple for\u000athe next three months, and said I should learn from him. During our first\u000aclass, the very first thing he did was ask me to sing <i>Siddhi Vinayakam </i>a\u000afew times. He didn\u2019t know the song and wanted to learn it! He then sang it back\u000ato me to see \u201cif he was singing it correctly\u201d. He also proceeded to tell\u000aeveryone we met, that <i>I </i>had taught <i>him </i>the song!</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">Over\u000athe summer, my parents drove me back and forth every weekend (six hours each\u000away) so that I could learn from him. At the end of the summer, at his urging,\u000awe moved to Delhi in 1992, and later to Chennai in 1995, for the sole purpose\u000aof pursuing music seriously. If it had not been for him I would not have been a\u000aprofessional musician today.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">Music\u000awas TRS Mama\u2019s entire life and he could forget everything while immersed in it.\u000aOne day during class at Pittsburgh, he got so carried away that the class\u000acontinued on for hours, and we ended up skipping lunch. I was&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">extremely\u000ahungry. However, too shy to say anything, I started crying. When he realised\u000awhat had happened, he took me to the temple canteen and bought me uppuma. Many\u000aa time, he composed pallavis while travelling on the bus. He would inevitably\u000amiss his stop, get down at the terminus and land up taking a bus back to his\u000adestination. However, he would still say, \u201cSee what a beautiful pallavi this\u000ais! It was worth missing my stop for this!\u201d Music was</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">everything\u000ato him.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">Over\u000athe 20-odd years that I knew TRS Mama, I came to think of him as something of a\u000agrandfather-figure. When I look back on his classes, I always remember them as\u000abeing thoroughly enjoyable; packed with music, interesting anecdotes and lots\u000aof jokes. In fact, I learnt so much about the theory of music without even\u000arealising it. He was always patient, willing to sing a sangati or explain a\u000anuance an endless number of times and encouraged us to think that the sky was\u000athe limit. He would tell us to \u2018stretch the boundaries\u2019 and \u2018sing with\u000aabandon\u2019.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">He\u000aalways kept an open mind and urged us to learn good music whenever and wherever\u000awe could find it. If he heard artists sing kritis he didn\u2019t know, he would ask\u000aus to go and learn it from them, going so far as to call them and request them\u000ato teach us. He taught us to look for and appreciate music in every aspect of\u000alife, be it the powerful, pitch-perfect call of a street vendor or a beggar\u000asinging in the train.</span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-size: small;"><br /></span></div>\u000a<div class="MsoBodyText2">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small;">More than anything, TRS Mama was one of the most genuine\u000apeople I have met. He always saw the good in people and lived, breathed, ate\u000aand slept music. He was a true guru and role model for me, and inculcated many\u000avalues in me. He will truly be missed by everyone who knew him.</span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a
