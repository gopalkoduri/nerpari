Lights brightened the artistically designed stage, and rhythmic beats followed by a chorus of voices set the tone for an evening of transcending music at Aikya 2012, at the Music Academy on 26 February.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Aikya 2012, described as a \u2018kaleidoscopic concert\u2019, had a legacy to live up to as the two previous versions organized by Global Adjustments Services and Interface were popular successes. The concerts, in support of <i>Smrutha Dhwani,</i> an NGO, have been an initiative for honouring retiring artists in the field of performing arts. They have been marked by themes such as diversity and duality that aim to create a nexus between music and everyday life, according to Anita Krishnaswamy, President of Global Adjustments. Having featured accomplished singers such as Aruna Sairam, Sudha Raghnathan and TM Krishna in previous years, Aikya 2012 starred Bombay Jayashri.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The concert, with its central theme described as an exploration of relationships as metaphorical strings and circumscribing boundaries, was a musical pastiche. It unfolded in a seemingly arbitrary manner to feature a variety of tunes, of broadly varying genres and periods.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">There was something on offer for everyone. As a rasika of music, you could sample the Sanskrit composition \u2018Sri Valli\u2019 in ragam <i>Natabhairavi,</i> the Hindi song, <i>\u2018hanak jhanak payal baje</i> and the <i>abhang, Bhakta jana vatsale.</i> Carnatic music fans savoured the familiar notes of Tyagaraja\u2019s <i>Mokshamu galada</i> in Saramati, rendered in Jayashri\u2019s mellifluous voice, while the ghazal Ranjish<i> hi</i> sahi and a Tansen melody in <i>Gurjari Todi</i> were pleasant offerings from the music genres of the north.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">A number of listeners would have been taken by surprise when the orchestra broke out into the strains of popular film songs like <i>Aap ki nazaron ne samjha.</i> Instrumental renderings of various Ilayaraja melodies were met with enthusiastic applause. Movie songs are those familiar tunes that remind us of many things, Jayashri said, in one of her many brief commentaries that interspersed the singing.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The final <i>tillana</i> in the ragam Sindhubhairavi rose to a crescendo and provided the perfect climax to the evening.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The concert, according to the organizers, commemorated 150 years of the Indian national anthem and was dedicated to the Bengali poet laureate, Rabindranath Tagore. A sample of Rabindra Sangeet would have thus been a perfect acknowledgment of the poet\u2019s contribution to our musical and literary heritage.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The orchestra was an excellent complement to the vocals of Jayashri and seven of her students. In combination and perfect tandem, the strings, percussion and keys provided a soulful background to the traditional music and wove a tapestry of non-conventional tunes, including some from South East Asia. Embar Kannan with one of his spellbinding performances on the violin and Navin Iyer on the flute were exceptional. The soul-stirring lyrics of the Bharatiyar composition, <i>Maalaipozhudhil</i> were enhanced by the ambience of twilight created by Navneeth Sundar on the keys. Sai Sravanam on the tabla and J. Vaidhyanathan on the mridangam ably augmented the depth of the instrumental talent of the evening.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Speaking about being part of Aikya 2012, Embar Kannan said, \u201cIt was a really out-of-this-world experience,. a musical journey for all of us in different genres. We all went through the journey together. It wasn\u2019t about an individual. It\u2019s the greatness of our music.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Though at many points Jayashri\u2019s voice seemed to be eclipsed, her vocal range, perfect enunciation and unique tonality did indeed mesh to provide the musical treat that was Aikya 2012. Speaking about the choice of the versatile artiste for this edition of Aikya, Anita Krishnaswamy said, \u201cNo one else can sing an entire range from classical to the lightest form, spanning all genres of music. And the theme just lends itself. She understands music in every little way and blends everything seamlessly, taking the audience with her.\u201d</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Aikya 2012, though near perfect in many aspects, did not carry over the conceptual and artistic grandeur of the previous editions. The stage lighting, which has always been a noticeable feature of the framework of design, seemed to be mismanaged in places. The acoustics of the Academy too, did not prove satisfactory on the occasion.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The author is a postgraduate student of Asian College of Journalism.</span></div></div>
