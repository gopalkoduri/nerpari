His exposure to music came from brother Basavaraj of Wamanrao Master\u2019s drama troupe. Nilkanthbua was so impressed by his talent that he took him on as his disciple. Mansur returned to acting for his livelihood, but dreamed of becoming a classical singer. It was suggested he take further training from Sawai Gandharva, but Mansur did not rate his music high. At a friend\u2019s shop in Bombay, he chanced to meet Manji Khan, son of maestro Alladiya Khan. The friend played a record of Mansur to persuade Manji Khan to teach the Dharwar man. Followed rewarding lessons, which continued after the master\u2019s demise under his brother Bhurji Khan. The bristling complexities of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana fascinated Mansur. He revelled in its challenging rhythm patterns, its vast repertoire of ragas, in the techniques of khyal singing. It gave him freedom to improvise in the grand manner. His treatment of the antara came in for special attention.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Son and disciple Rajshekhar Mansur, a vocalist who teaches English at the Dharwar University, reminisced, \u201cOur house of two rooms had to hold us eight siblings. We woke to father\u2019s morning riyaz, returned from school to hear him practise, and went to sleep at night with his voice ringing in our ears. No, he did not encourage me to take up music as a profession. He had faced too many problems in his career\u201d.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Many thought Mansur was difficult, haughty. Certainly he had few disciples compared to those who crowded the Rajguru home. \u201cFather was impatient,\u201d admitted Rajshekhar. \u201cHe never praised me. Today I am glad he didn\u2019t. It kept me growing\u201d. Disciple S. V. Bhirdikar reasoned that perhaps Mansur\u2019s sishyas simply did not meet his standards. \u201cHe was totally engrossed in his music. Were we as passionately committed, I wonder.\u201d A friend repeated Mansur\u2019s rueful admission in old age, \u201cPeople flock to hear me now as they never did when I was at the peak of my powers\u201d.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The vocalist could be sharp tongued. When an old timer complained he did not sing like Alladiya Khan, Mansur demonstrated that style and said, \u201cThis is Khansaheb\u2019s method, but am I his stenographer?\u201d Scholars surmised that Mansur\u2019s highlighting the tara shadja was the influence of Rehmat Khan of Gwalior. Rajashekhar summed up, \u201cUnlike Rajguru, my father never tried to please the audience. Rather, he tried to raise them to his level\u201d. Mansur is remembered for introducing the highly philosophical Kannada vachanas of Basava and Mahadevi Akka in Hindustani music. The idea was mooted by Kannada novelist A. N. Krishnarao on a stroll by the Shalmali river.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />A restless spirit was Basavaraj Rajguru who spent his lifetime learning from as many sources as possible. An astonishing twelve gurus from many parts of India and several gharanas tell their own tale. He went to Lateef Khan in Pakistan, managing to escape with his skin intact during the Partition years. When bandits attacked the Frontier Mail near Amritsar, young Basavaraj hid under the train on the steel shafts. He was wholly without guile. \u201cI found this cheez in the Agra gharana,\u201d he would announce on the stage and proceed to sing it. On his boltaans the impact of Carnatic music was evident, especially of swaraprastara.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Rajguru\u2019s home in Dharwar was unpretentious. We were welcomed by his son who ran a grocery shop at the entrance. Soft-spoken Prabhavati Devi was proud to share her memories of her late husband. \u201cHe was from a family of priests who served kings, but I always saw him as a raja. Begum Akhtar called him Sur ka Badshah (king of melody).\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />We piece together the facts of Rajguru\u2019s career from her account. Beginning with Carnatic music at six, and initial training under Panchakshari Gavai, Rajguru went on a cross-country pilgrimage of learning. Not satisfied with khyal, he studied dhrupad, dhamar, tappa, thumri, ghazal, qawwali and bhajan. He cut several popular discs, acted in plays which touched his concert renderings of natyasangeet with a verve all their own. With an amazing collection of 12,000 compositions, he shaped his individual style. And though he failed to train his children in music, he had many disciples who remember him with love and gratitude.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Shantaram Hegde who taught at the Karnatak Music College burst out, \u201cHe was everything we wanted in a guru. He gave us affection and no holds barred training, often correcting our mistakes with a joke. As accompanists we could not follow him on his soaring flights in the upper octave. He would smile at us with sympathy as he hit the high notes. He encouraged us to try many things, gave appreciation when it was due.\u201d</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Since this discussion took place at the radio station in Dharwar, we attracted staff members eager to share stories about this colourful artist. Raghunath Nakod, who accompanied Rajguru on the tabla, started describing Rajguru\u2019s lovable eccentricities. \u201cHe carried 24 pieces of luggage, including a wooden crate which held his VIP suitcase\u201d. Some of the trunks contained a whole kitchen of vessels and provisions. Rajguru cooked his own food, which he shared with his party. He would ask Raghunath to practise as long as he cooked - in order to drown the noise of the kerosene stove, banned in lodges!</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />He carried drinking water in pots placed in buckets. When the water got over between two concerts in Delhi, Rajguru thought nothing of journeying back to Dharwar for a refill. His love of milk made him take the train everyday to Hubli, to a special vendor who supplied it. In Bombay he would go to Victoria Road from his Dadar lodge, just to treat himself and his accompanists to milk at a particular halwai\u2019s place. They were pressed to enjoy the delicacies of each town at the guru\u2019s expense. Rajguru invariably halted at Pune on his way to Bombay to spend a few days at his favourite Badshah Lodge. There, late at night, he recorded some of his vast repertoire. \u201cGenerous to a fault, he spent lavishly,\u201d sighed Hegde.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Dharwar has not made any notable contribution to instrumental music. But two families settled in the town produced three generations of sitar and tabla players. Arjunsa Nakod took music lessons to work in a drama company. Son Raghunath and siblings took up the tabla and perform as a trio. They are much in demand as accompanists to leading artists. Grandson Ravikiran is a talent to watch for.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />The sitar family\u2019s oldest living member is A. Karim Khan, with a vocalist grandfather and a beenkar father Rehmat Khan. \u201cHe had to transfer the been technique to the sitar to make a living. His guru forbade him to take money for playing the been,\u201d says the bedridden Khansaheb. His seven sons play the sitar, including Bale Khan at AIR. The family orchestrates several sitars for the occasional show.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />At the time of writing, Dharwar had no star musician except for Gangubai Hangal. The department of music at the university and the Karnatak Music College turned out only degree holding teachers. But the town had something of immense value. It had dedicated teachers of the Gwalior, Jaipur and Kirana gharanas like the gentle, sweet voiced Chandrasekhar Puranikmath; and Sangameshwar Gurav, a direct disciple of Bhaskarbua Bhakle and Abdul Karim Khan. His ancestors were Carnatic musicians, which explains his son Kaivalya Kumar\u2019s introducing its flavours in his gayaki. To father and son, Abdul Karim Khan\u2019s words were a litany, \u201cMusic must reach not the ear alone, but the heart\u201d.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />Such teachers were not without hope for Dharwar\u2019s future in music. \u201cThere is excellent talent here,\u201d said Puranikmath. \u201cIt may take a while to mature. And there are earnest listeners to encourage it\u201d. Gurav conceded that the eagerness of youngsters could get dissipated because Dharwar did not offer them a future. There were no industrialist sponsors, no media attention.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />But Kaivalya Kumar\u2019s obvious vocal skills prove that, with commitment and sound training, such drawbacks can be overcome. Groomed by father Bale Khan in the sitar, young Hafiz Ali Khan had the last word. \u201cDharwar is a great place for learning music without the distractions and tensions of city life. Artists are respected here. A career can be pursued anywhere; the important thing is to complete my training\u201d.</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br />(This is an edited version of the article \u201cWhere North Meets South\u201d that appeared in <i>The Hindu Folio</i> in November 1998)</span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: justify;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /><i>Gowri Ramnarayan is a performing arts critic, playwright and translator)</i></span></div>\u000a<div style="text-align: right;">\u000a<span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><b>(Concluded)</b></span></div>\u000a</div>\u000a</div>\u000a
