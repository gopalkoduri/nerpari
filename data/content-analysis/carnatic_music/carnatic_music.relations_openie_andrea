Archeological digs in the Holy Land	have discovered	flutes from both the Bronze Age
The flute	has also been	an essential part of  Indian culture  and mythology
The flute	has also been	always
A flute	produces	sound  when a stream of air directed across a hole in the instrument
a stream of air	directed	across a hole in the instrument
The air stream across this hole	creates	a  Bernoulli , or siphon
This	excites	the air contained in the usually cylindrical  resonant cavity  within the flute
the air	contained	in the usually cylindrical  resonant cavity  within the flute
The player	changes	the  pitch  of the sound
the sound	produced	by opening and closing holes in the body of the instrument
a flute player	can also change	the pitch of a note
a flute	must use	a larger resonator, a larger air stream, or increased air stream  velocity
A flute's  volume	can generally be increased	by making its resonator and tone holes larger
a concert flute's air stream	measures	a fraction of an inch
a police whistle	is	very wide for its pitch
a pipe organ	can be	far louder than a concert flute
a large  organ pipe	can contain	several cubic feet of air
This	is	why a police whistle, a form of flute, is very wide for its pitch
its tone hole	may be	several inches wide
The air stream	must be directed	at the correct angle and velocity
a precisely formed and placed windway	will compress	In  fippled  or ducted flutes
a precisely formed and placed windway	channel	the air
a precisely formed and placed windway	channel	to the labium ramp edge across the open window
a precisely formed and placed windway	channel	In  fippled  or ducted flutes
this air	is supplied	by a regulated blower
this air	is supplied	In the pipe organ
the air stream	is shaped	In non-fipple flutes
the air stream	directed	by the player's lips
the air stream	called	the  embouchure
This	allows	the player a wide range of expression in pitch, volume, and timbre
a beginner	to produce	a full sound
a beginner	to produce	on
it	makes	an  end blown flute  or transverse flute considerably more difficult for a beginner to produce a full sound on than a ducted flute, such as the  recorder
end-blown flutes	take	more air to play, which requires deeper breathing and makes  circular breathing  a considerably trickier proposition
the quality	called	timbre or "tone colour
the flute	can produce	harmonics
A harmonic	is	a frequency that is a whole number multiple of a lower register, or
a frequency	is	a whole number multiple of a lower register
that	is a whole number multiple of	a lower register
the air stream	is thinner (vibrating in	more modes )
Head joint geometry	appears	particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone
there	is no clear consensus on	a particular shape
Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole	appears	the most critical parameter
Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance	include	chimney length (hole between lip-plate and head tube), chimney diameter, and radii or curvature of the ends of the chimney and any designed restriction in the "throat" of the instrument, such as that in the Japanese  Nohkan  Flute
A study in which professional players were blindfolded	could find	no significant differences between instruments
instruments	made	from a variety of different metals
no instrument	was correctly identified	in a first listening
no instrument	was correctly identified	In two different sets of blind listening
only the silver instrument	was identified	in a second
The study	concluded	that there was "no evidence that the wall material has any appreciable effect on the sound color or dynamic range of the instrument
a flute	can be	an open tube which is blown like a bottle
a flute	can be	In its most basic form
There	are several broad classes of	flutes
the musician	blows directly	across the edge of the mouthpiece
their bottom lip	covering	the embouchure hole
some flutes, such as the  whistle ,  gemshorn ,  flageolet ,  recorder ,  tin whistle ,  tonette ,  fujara , and  ocarina	have	a duct that directs the air onto the edge (an arrangement that is termed a " fipple ")
a duct	directs	the air
a duct	directs	onto the edge
an arrangement	is termed	a " fipple
These	are known	as fipple flutes
The fipple	gives	the instrument
The fipple	gives	a distinct timbre which is different from non-fipple flutes and makes the instrument easier to play
a distinct timbre	is	different from non-fipple flutes
a distinct timbre	makes	the instrument easier to play
Another division	is	between side-blown (or  transverse ) flutes, such as the Western concert flute,  piccolo ,  fife ,  dizi  and  bansuri
The player of a side-blown flute	uses	a hole on the side of the tube
The player of a side-blown flute	uses	to produce a tone, instead of blowing on an end of the tube
End-blown flutes	should not be confused	with fipple flutes such as the  recorder
fipple flutes such as the  recorder	have	an internal duct to direct the air flow across the edge of the tone hole
Flutes	may be	open
Flutes	may be	at one or both ends
Open-ended flutes such as the concert flute and the recorder	have	more harmonics
An organ pipe	may be	either open or closed
Flutes	may have	any number of pipes or tubes
one	is	the most common number
Flutes with multiple  resonators	may be played	one resonator
Flutes with multiple  resonators	may be played	at a time
Flutes	can be played	with several different air sources
some cultures	use	nose flutes
The  flue pipes  of  organs	are acoustically	similar to duct flutes
The  flue pipes  of  organs , which are acoustically similar to duct flutes	are blown	by bellows or fans
The  Western concert flute	is	a transverse flute that is closed at the top
a transverse flute	is closed	at the top
The Western concert flute	[is] a descendant of	the 19th-century German flute
An " embouchure  hole	is positioned	near the top, across
The flute	has circular	tone holes, larger than the finger holes of its baroque predecessors
the fingering system	used	to produce the notes in the flute's  range
the fingering system	to produce	the notes
The size and placement of tone holes, the key mechanism, and the fingering system	were evolved	from 1832 to 1847 by  Theobald Boehm
Boehm's design	known	as the  Boehm system
Western concert flutes	typically conform	to Boehm's design
Beginner's flutes	are normally made	of nickel, silver or brass
professionals	use	solid silver, gold, and sometimes platinum instruments
The wood	is	usually
The wood	is	African Blackwood
The standard concert flute	is pitched	in the key of C

These	are	common on carved top guitars such as the  Gibson Les Paul ,  Paul Reed Smith models , and on slab body guitars like the  Music Man Albert Lee  and  Fender guitars
the  Music Man Albert Lee  and  Fender guitars	are not	vibrato arm equipped
These	appear	on  Rickenbackers ,  Gretschs
Pictured	is	a " tremolo arm " or " vibrato tailpiece " style bridge/tailpiece system, often called a "whammy bar" or "trem

an acoustic guitar	has	a hollow body
electric guitars	make	less audible sound
their strings	are	plucked
electric guitars	are normally plugged	into a guitar amplifier
magnets	wound	with coils of very fine wire
string movement	produces	a signal by generating (i.e., " inducing ") a small electric current in the magnetic pickups,
string movement	produces	When an electric guitar is played
i.e.	inducing	a small electric current in the magnetic pickups
the magnetic pickups	are	magnets  wound with coils of very fine wire
The signal	passes	through the tone and volume circuits
The signal	passes	to the output jack
The current induced	is	proportional to such factors as string density, and amount of movement over the pickups
a guitar's magnetic pickups	are normally embedded	in wax,  lacquer , or  epoxy
a guitar's magnetic pickups	are normally embedded	to prevent the pickup from producing a  microphonic  effect
the pickup	from producing	a  microphonic  effect
all magnetic pickups	tend	to pick up ambient
all magnetic pickups	to pick up	ambient
all magnetic pickups	to pick up	usually unwanted  electromagnetic interference  or EMI
The resulting  hum	is	particularly strong with single-coil pickups
many vintage guitars	are insufficiently shielded	against electromagnetic interference
The most common source	is	50 or 60  Hz  hum from  power transmission  systems
audio equipment	associated	with electric guitars
it	is	a continuing technical challenge to reduce or eliminate unwanted hum
Double-coil or " humbucker " pickups	were invented	as a way
the unwanted ambient hum	known	as 60 cycle hum
Humbuckers	have	two coils of opposite magnetic and electric polarity to produce a  differential  signal
the pickup signal	cancels out	the noise
The two coils	are wired	in phase
This high combined  inductance  of the two coils	leads	to the richer
fatter" tone	associated	with humbucking pickups
Piezoelectric pickups	use	a "sandwich" of quartz crystal or other piezoelectric material typically placed beneath the string saddles or nut

Polyrhythm	is	the simultaneous use of two or more conflicting rhythms, that are not readily perceived as deriving from one another, or as simple manifestations of the same meter
the simultaneous use of two or more conflicting rhythms	are not readily perceived	as deriving from one another
Polyrhythm	is the simultaneous use of	two or more conflicting rhythms
The rhythmic conflict	may be	the basis of an entire piece of music ( cross-rhythm ), or a momentary disruption
Polyrhythms	can be distinguished	from  irrational rhythms
at least two rhythms	to be played	concurrently
one of which	is typically	an irrational rhythm
polyrhythms	require	at least two rhythms
polyrhythm	contradicts	the prevailing meter
polyrhythm	contradicts	In some  European art music
polyrhythm	contradicts	periodically
polyrhythm	is heard	in the first few minutes of  Beethoven 's  Third Symphony  and in the first movement of  Brahms 's  Violin Concerto
a curiously persistent  cross-rhythm	does	its best
a curiously persistent  cross-rhythm	does	to persuade us
it	is really	in 6/8
Ernest Walker	states	The vigorously effective  Scherzo  is in 3/4 time
The vigorously effective  Scherzo	is	in 3/4 time
The illusion of simultaneous 3/4 and 6/8	suggests	polymeter
triple meter	combined	with  compound duple meter
the two beat schemes	interact	within a metric hierarchy
the duple beats	are	secondary
the duple beats	are	cross-beats  within a triple beat scheme
The triple beats	are	primary
the duple beats	are cross-beats within	a triple beat scheme
The four-note  ostinato  pattern of  Mykola Leontovych 's " Carol of the Bells	is	the composite of the two-against-three  hemiola
Another example of polyrhythm	can be found	in measures 64 and 65 of the first movement of  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's  Twelfth Piano Sonata
Three evenly-spaced sets of three attack-points	span	two measures
Cross-rhythm	refers	to systemic polyrhythm
The "New Harvard Dictionary of Music	states	that cross-rhythm is: "A rhythm in which the regular pattern of accents of the prevailing meter is contradicted by a conflicting pattern and not merely a momentary displacement that leaves the prevailing meter fundamentally unchallenged" (1986: 216
cross-rhythm	is	A rhythm in which the regular pattern of accents of the prevailing meter is contradicted by a conflicting pattern and not merely a momentary displacement that leaves the prevailing meter fundamentally unchallenged" (1986: 216
the regular pattern of accents of the prevailing meter	is contradicted	by a conflicting pattern
the regular pattern of accents of the prevailing meter	is contradicted	A rhythm
A rhythm in which the regular pattern of accents of the prevailing meter is contradicted by a conflicting pattern and not merely a momentary displacement	leaves	the prevailing meter
A rhythm in which the regular pattern of accents of the prevailing meter is contradicted by a conflicting pattern and not merely a momentary displacement	leaves	fundamentally unchallenged
A simple example of a cross-rhythm	is	3 evenly-spaced notes against 2 (3:2), also known as a  hemiola
3 evenly-spaced notes against 2	also known	as a  hemiola
a cross-rhythm	is 3 evenly-spaced notes against	2 ( 3 :2 )
Two simple and common ways to express this pattern in standard western musical notation	would be	3 quarter notes over 2 dotted quarter notes within one bar of 6/8 time, quarter note triplets over 2 quarter notes
the 3:4 ratio	produces	a  perfect fourth
the 4:5 ratio	produces	a  major third
the 2:3 ratio	produces	the musical interval of a  perfect fifth
the 2:3 ratio	produces	in an audible frequency range
There	is a parallel between	cross rhythms
All these  interval ratios	are found	in the  harmonic series
the most fundamental parts	typically emphasize	the primary beats
the most fundamental parts	typically emphasize	In traditional European ("Western") rhythms
the most fundamental parts	typically emphasize	the secondary beats
the most fundamental parts	typically emphasize	in rhythms of sub-Saharan African origin
This	causes	the uninitiated ear to misinterpret the secondary beats as the primary beats, and to hear the true primary beats as cross-beats
This	causes	often
the uninitiated ear	to misinterpret	the secondary beats
the musical "background" and "foreground	felt	in reverse—Peñalosa
the meter	is	in a permanent state of contradiction
cross-rhythm	is	the generating principle
cross-rhythm	is	In  Sub-Saharan African music traditions
Cross-rhythm	was explained	as the basis of sub-Saharan rhythm in lectures by C.K. Ladzekpo and the writings of David Locke
Cross-rhythm	was explained	first
cross-beats	can symbolize	the challenging moments or emotional stress we all encounter
the challenging moments or emotional stress	encounter	we
Playing cross-beats while fully grounded in the main beats	prepares	one for maintaining a life-purpose
Many sub-Saharan languages	do not have	a word for "rhythm", or even "music
they	are	an embodiment of the people
they	are	symbolizing interdependence in human relationships—Peñalosa
the rhythms	represent	the very fabric of life
they	are an embodiment of	the people
the composer	conveys	his ideas
At the center of a core of rhythmic traditions	is	the technique of cross-rhythm
his ideas	is the technique of	cross-rhythm
The technique of cross-rhythm	is	a simultaneous use of contrasting rhythmic patterns within the same scheme of accents or  meter
the main beat scheme	can not be separated	from the secondary beat scheme
It	is	the interplay of the two elements
the two elements	produces	the cross-rhythmic texture—Ladzekpo
It	is the interplay of	the two elements
textures	found	in West African musics
The 3:2 relationship	is	the foundation of most typical polyrhythmic
3:2	is	the "generative" or "theoretic form" of sub-Saharan rhythmic principles
rhythm	holds	the key to understanding
2 and 3	belong	to a single Gestalt
Victor Kofi Agawu	succinctly states	The resultant [3:2] rhythm holds the key to understanding... there is no independence here, because 2 and 3 belong to a single Gestalt
The resultant [3:2] rhythm holds the key to understanding	is	no independence here
The resultant [3:2] rhythm holds the key to understanding	is	because 2 and 3 belong to a single Gestalt
The two beat schemes	interact	within the hierarchy of a single meter
The duple beats	are	primary
the triple beats	are	secondary
The example below	shows	the African 3:2 cross-rhythm within its proper metric structure
The music of African  Xylophones  such as the  balafon  and  gyil	is based	on cross-rhythm
The music of African  Xylophones  such as the  balafon  and  gyil	is based	often
a Ghanaian gyil	sounds	a 3:2-based  ostinato  melody
The left hand	sounds	the two main beats
the right hand	sounds	the three cross-beats
The cross-beats	are written	as quarter-notes for visual emphasis
The following notated example	is	from the kushuara part of the traditional  mbira  piece
The mbira	is	a  lamellophone
The left hand	plays	the ostinato bass line
The left hand	plays	while the right hand plays the upper melody

Sub-Saharan instruments	are constructed	in a variety of ways
Some instruments	organize not	the pitches
the straight linear  bass  to  treble  structure	is	so common to many western instruments such as the  piano ,  harp , or  marimba
This family of instruments	are found	in several forms indigenous to different regions of Africa

one	needs	to count a total of 6 beats, as lcm(2,3) = 6 (123456 and 123456
one	needs to count	a total of 6 beats
one	needs to count	as lcm(2,3) = 6 (123456 and 123456

There	are twelve semitones of	the octave S , R1 , R2=G1 , R3=G2 , G3 , M1 , M2 , P , D1 , D2=N1 , D3=N2 ,
A melakarta raga	must necessarily have	S and P
R	must necessarily precede	G and D

The shruti or sruti	is	a  Sanskrit  term
a  Sanskrit  term	used	in several contexts throughout the history of  Indian music
the difference between them	is	perceptible
Bharata	uses	shruti
Bharata	uses	to mean the interval between two notes such that the difference between them is perceptible
Bharata	uses shruti to mean	the interval between two notes
He	formulates	jatis , which are classes of melodic structures
jatis	are	classes of melodic structures
which	are classes of	melodic structures
These	can be further grouped	into two  gramas
The notes	are separated	by intervals
intervals	are measured	in terms of shrutis
The shadja-grama	is given	by the following division
Bharata	describes	an experiment
Bharata	describes	to obtain the correct physical configuration of shruti
The madhyama-grama	is	the same
the panchama	to be diminished	by one shruti
the panchama of madhyama-grama	is	lower than that of shadja-grama by one shruti
Shruti	is only mentioned	as a perceptual measure in the music of Bharata's time
there	are three perceptible intervals between	Sa and Ri
The third of these	is called	trishruti rishabha
the second interval	is called	dvishruti rishabha
Notes at nine and 13 shrutis from each other	are	mutually
The notes	are	at the distance of two and 20 shrutis
The notes that are at the distance of two and 20 shrutis	are dissonant	mutually vivādi
The remaining ones	are called	anuvādi" (assonant
The remaining ones	are called	at the distance between 2 and 20 shrutis
The shruti table below	shows	the mathematical ratios considered to correspond to the system
the mathematical ratios	considered	to correspond to the system
the mathematical ratios	to correspond	to the system
the system	described	by Bharata and Dattila
the 22 shrutis	provided	by Śārñgadeva
The  53-TET  approximation	has	an maximum error of 1.5 cents
the perfect fifths approximation	has	an maximum error of 2 cents
the harmonics in scales of shruti	are	multiples of prime numbers 2
shruti	are multiples of	prime numbers 2 , 3 , 5 and 19
that	's	too weird
we	use	the harmonic 19.2
all of the harmonics	multiplies up	by 5
19.2/32 = 3/5	means	that when we use the harmonic 19.2, it becomes the harmonic 3, and all of the harmonics multiplies up by 5
it	becomes	the harmonic 3
it	becomes	when we use the harmonic 19.2
the grama system	was no longer	in use
Venkatamakhin	formulated	the  melakarta
the mela system	uses	the same starting swara
it	forms	the scales
the gandhara	precede	them
The interval of "kakali-nishada	would be	of three different shruti values
panca-sruti or shat-shruti-dhaivata	preceded	it
a measure of interval	is not utilized	in the mela system
The mela system	prevails	still
The term	has	several meanings
It	is used	by musicians in several contexts
the Tamil term	would mean	that the "tonic" is set to the pitch C or the first key
the "tonic	is set	to the pitch C or the first key
The Telugu term	is	a way to correspond with the accompanying artists
The term	has also undergone	a gross misunderstanding
listeners	perceive	a sharpened or flattened version of an existing note
listeners	perceive	In certain  ragas
the non-contextual Bharata's 22 shrutis	lead	to confusion and controversy
Some scholars	have attempted	to fit such perceived new tones into the non-contextual Bharata's 22 shrutis
Some scholars	have attempted to fit	such perceived new tones
Some scholars	have attempted to fit	into the non-contextual Bharata's 22 shrutis
It	was wrongly attributed	to Bharata
Bharata	proposed	shruti
Bharata	proposed	in a completely different context
these intermediate tones	perceived	in the contemporary rendition of a raga
scientific evidence	shows	that these intermediate tones perceived in the contemporary rendition of a raga does not hint at the existence of 22 shrutis
these intermediate tones perceived in the contemporary rendition of a raga	does not hint	at the existence of 22 shrutis
number 22	is	of no practical significance in the current performance of Carnatic and Hindustani music traditions
The phenomenon of intermediate tones	is pursued	as an active area of research in  Indian Musicology
an active area of research in  Indian Musicology	says	the number of perceptible intermediate tones may be less or even much more than 22
the number of perceptible intermediate tones	may be	less or even much more than 22

N. Ramanathan	says	that the idea of 22 shrutis is applicable only to the music system of Bharata's time
the idea of 22 shrutis	is	applicable only to the music system of Bharata's time
The sufficiently new Indian monograph about shruti	say	there had been various opinions about the number (66, 53) of shrutis, but in recent times it seems that the number of shrutis is broadly agreed upon as 22

The blue bars on the sides of the chart	represent	the usual possibilities for beginners' tape placements
which	is a natural start for	simple tunes
The placement of the left hand on the fingerboard	is characterized	by "positions
First position	start	most beginners
First position	start	in third position
the highest notes in first position	are stopped	with the fourth finger on the E-string
The lowest note available in this position in standard tuning	is	an open G
the first finger	placed	on the E-string
the first finger placed on the E-string	gives	an F.
the first finger placed on the E-string	gives	in "first position
Third position	is achieved down so on	when the first finger presses
the first finger	sounds	a semitone above the open string and the other fingers a tone or semitone below their normal positions, e.g. (on the A string
the first finger	sounds	a "half position
The same notes	could be played	in first position with the first finger moving from "low first" (A) to B
the first finger	moving	from "low first" (A
the first finger	moving	to B
this	would produce	a sliding first finger, which is not always desirable
a sliding first finger	is not	always
a sliding first finger	is not	desirable
The upper limit of the violin's range	is largely determined	by the skill of the player
A skilled player	can play	more than two octaves on a single string, and four octaves on the instrument as a whole
the "high" B note	referred	to
the "high" B note	referred	above can be played not only by the fourth finger on the E-string in first position, but also by the fourth finger in fifth position on the A-string, in ninth position on the D-string, and in thirteenth position on the G-string
Violinists	change	positions on the lower strings
Violinists	change	sometimes to the consternation of composers and much to the confusion of beginners
Violinists	change	often
This	is done	to handle a musical passage
This	is done	usually
a musical passage	would require	fast switching (or "crossing") of strings
It	is also done	to produce a particular  timbre

Different strings	have	different  tone quality
Different strings	have	because of their different physical composition and their difference resonances on the instrument
The choice of timbres on different strings	is	vital to the musicality of the instrument
intermediate and advanced players	will deliberately play	in a higher position on a lower string for effect
intermediate and advanced players	will deliberately play	often
This effect	is indicated	by the composer or arranger
This effect	is indicated	sometimes
a composer	wants	a passage that would otherwise be taken on the D-string
they	write	sul G" or "G saite" or "G corde" (or simply, "on G
The most common indication	uses	the letter name of the string
numbers	are used	Occasionally
the simplest way to indicate	is alone	to write the number (e.g.

A special timbre results from playing a note without touching its string with a finger	sounding	the lowest note
A special timbre results from playing a note without touching its string with a finger	sounding	on that string
a very distinct sound	resulting	from absence of the damping action of a finger, and from the fact that vibrato (see below) is produced differently than on fingered notes
open strings	are selected	for special effects
open strings	are selected	sometimes
One striking effect	employs	open strings
One striking effect that employs open strings	is	bariolage
This	is	the repeated alternation of notes played on two or more strings,
the repeated alternation of notes	played	on two or more strings
one of the notes	is	usually
one of the notes	is	an open string
This	is the repeated alternation of	notes
This string crossing	is	often
This string crossing	is	rapid
the same pitch as an open string	will be fingered	on an adjacent string
the same pitch as an open string	will be fingered	so that the alternation is between the same note on two strings
the same pitch as an open string	will be fingered	Sometimes
the alternation	is	between the same note on two strings
Bariolage	was	a favorite device of  Joseph Haydn
Bariolage	was a favorite device of	Joseph Haydn
It	is prominently featured	in the Preludium of Bach's  Partita No.3 in E major
Playing an open string simultaneously with a stopped note on an adjacent string	produces	a  bagpipe -like drone, often used by composers in imitation of  folk music

Double stopping	is	when stopped notes are played on two adjacent strings
stopped notes	are played	on two adjacent strings
This	is	more difficult than normal single-string playing
fingers	must be accurately placed	on two strings
fingers	must be accurately placed	simultaneously
the left hand	to be	able to reach both notes at once
the left hand	to reach	both notes
the left hand	to reach	at once
Double stopping	is also used	to mean playing on three or all four strings at once
Sounding an open string alongside a fingered note	is	another way to get a harmony
it	is more properly called	a  drone
the drone note	may be sustained	for a passage of different notes
a passage of different notes	played	on the adjacent string
Vibrato	is	a technique of the left hand and arm in which the pitch of a note varies in a pulsating rhythm
the pitch of a note	varies	in a pulsating rhythm
Vibrato	is a technique of	the left hand and arm
it	is achieved	by fingertip movements
fingertip movements	alter	the length of the vibrating string
vibrato	ranging	from the use of just the fingers
There	are several different styles of	vibrato ranging
Vibrato	is perceived	to create a more emotional sound
Vibrato	is perceived	often
a shimmer	created	by the variations in projection of strongest sound
Vibrato	to create	a more emotional sound, and it is employed heavily in music of the  Romantic  era. The acoustic effect of vibrato has largely to do with adding interest and warmth to the sound
it	is employed heavily	in music of the  Romantic  era
A well-made violin	virtually points	its sound pattern
A well-made violin	virtually points	in different directions
Violinists	oscillate backwards	when using vibrato
aural perception	favors	the highest pitch in a varying sound
Vibrato	does	little
anything	to disguise	an out-of-tune note
Violin students, especially of beginner level	are taught	to use it only on extended notes

Vibrato	can be	difficult to learn
Vibrato	may take	a student
Vibrato	may take	several months
Each node	is	at an integer division of the string
The pitch	produced	in these two cases
The pitch produced in these two cases	will be higher	an octave higher in the case of halves, and an octave and a fifth
the string	vibrating	in thirds
A responsive instrument	will provide	numerous possible harmonic nodes along the length of the string
Harmonics	are marked	in music
the note	determines	the pitch of the harmonic
natural harmonics and artificial harmonics	also known	as "false harmonics
There	are two types of	harmonics
Artificial harmonics	are	more difficult to produce than the natural harmonics
the natural harmonics	described	above
Stopping a note on one string, for example first finger "E" on the D string, and having another finger	produces	the fourth harmonic of the "E
Stopping a note on one string, for example first finger "E" on the D string, and having another finger	produces	fourth  higher, in this case on the position of the note "A
These harmonics	are less commonly used	because they are more difficult to make sound well
they	are	more difficult
they	are	to make sound well
the stretch	is	comfortable for many violinists
the stretch	is	greater than is comfortable for many violinists
the stretch	is	in the case of the fifth
the harmonic	is	higher in the overtone series
the harmonic	is	In the case of the major third
The sounding pitch of the major third harmonic	is	two octaves and a major third above the lower note
it	is	an octave and a fifth above the lower note
it	is	in the case of the fifth
the lower note	employs	a round note-head representing
Traditional notation of artificial harmonics	uses	two notes
Traditional notation of artificial harmonics	uses	on one stem
the string	is lightly touched	with the fourth finger
the string	is strongly stopped	with the first finger
the upper note	uses	an open "diamond" note-head representing
Harmonics	are also	rarely played in double stops
both notes	are	harmonics
Elaborate passages in artificial harmonics	can be found	in virtuoso violin literature
The right arm, hand, and bow	are	responsible for tone quality,  rhythm ,  dynamics ,  articulation , and certain (but not all) changes in  timbre
The bow	is held	in the right hand
The bow	is held	with the thumb bent underneath the frog
The bow	is held	to support it and the other fingers loosely touching the wood
The middle and ring fingers	are wrapped	around the frog
The middle and ring fingers	are wrapped	although in some cases (such as in  baroque  performance practice) the whole hand holds the stick above the frog
The middle and ring fingers	are wrapped	usually
the whole hand	holds	the stick
the whole hand	holds	above the frog

finger to "unweight" the bow	using	as a  fulcrum
The most important thing in bowing	is not	that bowing action should be initiated and solely dependent upon movement of right hand, not by forearm, upper arm, and shoulder
bowing action	should be initiated	by forearm, upper arm, and shoulder
Flexion and extension of these parts	should be passive led	by right hand action
subtle and delicate bowing control	is	impossible
Increasing pressure on the strings	is	the primary way to produce louder notes on the violin
Pressure	is added mainly	by the index finger of the bowing hand

pressing down on the string	tends	to produce a focused, more intense sound
The two methods	are not	equivalent
The two methods	are not	because they produce different timbres
the bow	intersects	the string
the bow	intersects	The sounding point
The sounding point where the bow intersects the string	also influences	timbre
Playing close to the bridge ("sul ponticello	gives	a more intense sound than usual
playing with the bow over the end of the fingerboard ("sul tasto	makes	for a delicate, ethereal sound
one	may think	of different sounding points
one	may think	as "lanes" in the highway
Dr. Suzuki	referred	to the sounding point as the " Kreisler  highway

This	ensures	that the bow will stay in the desired sounding point and will create a consistent sound quality
the bow	will stay	in the desired sounding point
One technique to achieving a straight bow	is	as follows
these motions	will create	a straight downbow bow stroke
these motions	will create	When used correctly
A crucial step	is	to watch the bow and make sure it remains straight

a note	is marked	pizz
it	is played	abbreviation for " pizzicato ") in the written music
this	is indicated	by
This	allows	players to simultaneously play bowed notes while plucking on a different string

some players	have acquired	the trick of playing fast "pizzicato" passages
Players	continue	playing pizzicato
Players	continue playing	pizzicato
There	are two common positions for	playing pizzicato
One	is	to clench the bow in your right hand, rest your right thumb on the right side of the finger board
This position	can enhance	the tonal quality of the pluck
Another pizzicato position	is	to maintain your bow grip
This position	is	especially helpful
This position	is	when the composer alternates between series of arco and pizzicato notes, because it allows the violinist to quickly and accurately switch styles

Violins	are tuned	by turning the  pegs  in the pegbox under the scroll, or by turning the "fine tuner" screws at the  tailpiece
A violin	has	pegs
A violin	has	always
fine tuners	also called	fine adjusters
These	permit	the string tension to be adjusted in very small amounts much more easily than by using the pegs

Melharmony	is	an avant garde form of composing that was initiated by Indian born musician-composer Chitravina  N. Ravikiran  at the turn of the Millennium
an avant garde form of composing	was initiated	by Indian born musician-composer Chitravina  N. Ravikiran
Melharmony	is an avant garde form of	composing
Melharmony	has been defined	as "harmony and vertical layers of music in an aesthetic manner but with an emphasis on the rules and principles of highly evolved melodic systems such as the  Raga  system of Indian music
This concert example	shows	how the approach to creation of  Harmony  is distinctive in Melharmonic compositions from typical approaches in the West
the approach to creation of  Harmony	is	distinctive
principles	anchored	on melodic structure
The sequence of a raga	is	C D F A B E G C - C B A G F E D C.

There	are numerous melharmonic options for	various ragas
The name of the game	is	to create harmony but place importance on the melodic character of the music
Similar melharmonic options	can be created	for any highly evolved diverse melodic systems across the world
Ravikiran	has created	several Melharmonic compositions including pieces for Western Symphony Orchestras and Caprices for virtuoso violinists
These works	are flavored	with exciting and often original rhythmic patterns
These works	have brought	to light several modes/scales
These works	have brought	to Western audiences

The bars at the sides of the chart	represent	the usual possibilities for beginners' tape placements
The placement of the left hand on the fingerboard	is characterized	by "positions
most beginners	start	First position
some methods	start	in third position
First position, where most beginners start (although some methods start in third position)	is	the most commonly used position in string music

The upper limit of the violin's range	is largely determined	by the skill of the player
four octaves on the instrument as a whole	become	less common
a violinist	has progressed	to the point of being able to use the entire range of the instrument
The lowest position on a violin	is	half-position, where the first finger is a half-step away from the nut

a composer or arranger	specifies	the string to use for a particular  tone quality
a composer or arranger	specifies	Sometimes
the string	to use	for a particular  tone quality
This	is indicated	in the music
This	is indicated	by the marking
This	is indicated	for example
playing very high up on the lower strings	gives	a distinctive quality
playing very high up on the lower strings	gives	to the sound
the string	vibrates more freely	at the nut
any finger	stopping	it
Bowing or plucking an "open string	gives	a different sound
Bowing or plucking an "open string	gives	from a stopped string
Bowing or plucking an "open string	gives	since the string vibrates more freely at the nut than under a finger
open strings	are generally avoided	in some styles of  classical  playing
This	is	because they have a somewhat harsher sound
they	have	a somewhat harsher sound
it	is not	possible
it	is not	to directly use vibrato on an open string
a note	is	an octave higher than the open string
that	is an octave higher than	the open string
some cases	playing	an open string
they	can not be distinguished	a fast passage
they	can not be distinguished	usually
Playing an open string simultaneously with a stopped note on an adjacent string	produces	a  bagpipe -like drone, often used by composers in imitation of  folk music
a  bagpipe -like drone	used	by composers in imitation of  folk music

Double stopping	is	when two separate strings are stopped by the fingers, and bowed simultaneously
two separate strings	are stopped	by the fingers
the left hand	to be	able to reach both notes at once
the left hand	to reach	both notes
the left hand	to reach	at once
Sounding an open string alongside a fingered note	is	another way to get a partial chord
it	is more properly called	a drone
the drone note	may be sustained	for a passage of different notes
a passage of different notes	played	on the adjacent string
Three or four notes	can also be played respectively	at one time
Vibrato	is	a technique of the left hand and arm in which the pitch of a note varies in a pulsating rhythm
a technique of the left hand and arm	varies	in a pulsating rhythm
a technique of the left hand and arm	varies	to produce a more pleasant sound
Vibrato	is a technique of	the left hand and arm
various parts of the hand or arm	may be involved	in the motion
the end result	is	a movement of the fingertip
the fingertip	bringing about	a slight change in vibrating string length
the end result	is a movement of	the fingertip
Some violinists	oscillate backwards	when using vibrato
Some violinists	oscillate backwards	since it is believed that perception favors the highest pitch in a varying sound
it	is believed	that perception favors the highest pitch in a varying sound
perception	favors	the highest pitch in a varying sound
in other words, misapplied vibrato	is	a poor substitute for good intonation
Vibrato	does	little
misapplied vibrato	is a poor substitute for	good intonation
Music students	are taught	that unless otherwise marked in music, vibrato is assumed or even mandatory
Music students	are taught	often
This	can be	an obstacle to a classically trained violinist
baroque music	played	in period style and many traditional fiddling styles
a classically trained violinist	wishing	to play in a style
a classically trained violinist	wishing to play	in a style
a style	uses at all	little or no vibrato
Vibrato	can be produced	by a proper combination of finger, wrist and arm
One method	called	hand vibrato
One method, called "hand vibrato"	involves	rocking the hand back at the wrist to achieve oscillation, while another method, "arm vibrato", modulates the pitch by rocking at the elbow
another method	modulates	the pitch
A combination of these techniques	allows	a player to produce a large variety of tonal effects
a player	to produce	a large variety of tonal effects
violin vibrato	are artistic matters of	style and taste
you	overdo	the variation of the note's tone
it	may become	very distracting
it	overwhelm	the piece
the interest	adds	to the sound
vibrato	adds	a "shimmer" or "liveliness
vibrato	adds	to the sound of a well-made violin
vibrato	adds	By "pointing" the sound at different parts of the room in a rhythmic way
Vibrato	is	in a large part
Different types of vibrato	will bring	different moods

the varying degrees and styles of vibrato	are	often
the varying degrees and styles of vibrato	are	characteristics that stand out in well-known violinists
characteristics	stand out	in well-known violinists
Vibrato	can also be used	for a fast trill
A trill	initiated	from just hammering the finger up and down on the fingerboard
A trill initiated from just hammering the finger up and down on the fingerboard	will create	a harsher quality than with a vibrato trill
A trill	from just hammering	the finger
A trill	from just hammering	up and down on the fingerboard
The second finger	will lightly touch	the string above the first finger
The second finger	will lightly touch the string above the first finger causing	the pitch to change
This	has	a softer quality and many think it is nicer-sounding than a hammered trill
many	think	it is nicer-sounding than a hammered trill
it	is	nicer-sounding
Each node	is	at an integer division of the string
A responsive instrument	will sound	numerous possible harmonic nodes along the length of the string
Harmonics	are marked	in music
the note	determines	the pitch of the harmonic
natural harmonics and  artificial harmonics	also known	as "false harmonics
There	are two types of	harmonics
Natural harmonics	are played	on an open string
The pitch of the open string	is called	the fundamental frequency
Harmonics	are also called	overtones
They	occur	at whole-number multiples of the fundamental
the third harmonic	is	the second overtone
The second harmonic	is	the first  overtone
The second harmonic	is	in the middle of the string
The second harmonic	sounds	an octave higher than the string's pitch
The third harmonic	breaks	the string into thirds
The third harmonic	sounds	an octave and a fifth above the fundamental, and the fourth harmonic breaks the string into quarters sounding two octaves above the first
the fourth harmonic	breaks	the string
the fourth harmonic	breaks	into quarters
quarters	sounding	two octaves
The sound of the second harmonic	is	the clearest of them
The sound of the second harmonic	is	because it is a common  node  with all the succeeding even-numbered harmonics
it	is	a common  node  with all the succeeding even-numbered harmonics
all	succeeding	even-numbered harmonics
the second harmonic	is the clearest of	them
it	is a common node with	all the succeeding even-numbered harmonics
The third and succeeding odd-numbered harmonics	are	harder to play
The third and succeeding odd-numbered harmonics	are	because they break the string into an odd number of vibrating parts and do not share as many nodes with other harmonics
they	break	the string
they	break	into an odd number of vibrating parts
they	do not share	as many nodes
they	do not share	with other harmonics
Artificial harmonics	are	more difficult to produce than natural harmonics
they	involve stopping	the string
they	playing	a harmonic
the spacing between notes	changes	along the length of the string
both the stopped note	touched	note
both the stopped note and touched note	must be played	in the case of the major third
the stretch	is	greater than is comfortable for many violinists
the stretch	is	In the case of the fifth
the stretch	is	comfortable for many violinists
divisions up to an eighth	are used	sometimes
divisions as small as a twelfth	are	possible
a few books	dedicated solely	to the study of violin harmonics
Two comprehensive works	are	Henryk Heller's seven-volume "Theory of Harmonics", published by  Simrock  in 1928, and Michelangelo Abbado's five-volume "Tecnica dei suoni armonici

Elaborate passages in artificial harmonics	can be found	in virtuoso violin literature
Two notable examples of this	are	an entire section of  Vittorio Monti 's " Csárdás " and a passage towards the middle of the third movement of  Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky 's  Violin Concerto
this	are an entire section of	Vittorio Monti

The strings	may be sounded	by drawing the hair of the bow held by the right hand across them "(arco)" or by plucking them
The strings	by drawing	the hair of the bow held by the right hand across them "(arco)" or by plucking them
the bow	held	by the right hand
The right arm, hand, and bow	are	responsible for tone quality,  rhythm ,  dynamics ,  articulation , and most (but not all) changes in  timbre
The most essential part of bowing technique	is	the bow grip
It	is	usually

The pinky finger	is curled	with the tip of the finger
the tip of the finger	placed	on the wood next to the screw
The violin	produces	louder notes with greater bow speed or more weight on the string
they	produce	different timbres
pressing down on the string	tends	to produce a harsher, more intense sound
The two methods	are not	equivalent
The two methods	are not	because they produce different timbres
One	can also achieve	a louder sound
the bow	intersects	the string
the bow	intersects	The sounding point
The sounding point where the bow intersects the string	also influences	timbre
Playing close to the bridge ("sul ponticello	gives	a more intense sound than usual
playing with the bow over the end of the fingerboard ("sul tasto	makes	for a delicate, ethereal sound
one	may think	of different sounding points
one	may think	as "lanes" in the highway
Dr. Suzuki	referred	to the sounding point as the " Kreisler  highway
Various methods of attack with the bow	produce	different articulations
many bowing techniques	allow	for every range of playing style and many teachers, players, and orchestras spend a lot of time developing techniques and creating a unified technique within the group
These techniques	include	legato-style bowing,  collé , ricochet,  sautillé ,  martelé ,  spiccato , and staccato
A note	marked	pizz
abbreviation for " pizzicato ") in the written music	is	to be played by plucking the string with a finger of the right hand rather than by bowing
The index finger	is most commonly used	here
the other (usually the ring finger or little finger	is put	above the note
one	is put	on the correct note
two fingers	are put	on the string
two fingers	are put	In left-hand pizzicato
The higher finger	plucks	the string
The higher finger	plucks	while the lower one stays on

Descriptions and definitions of harmony and harmonic practice	may show	bias towards  European  (or  Western ) musical traditions
that	does not alter	in pitch
that	does not alter	throughout the course of a composition
the underlying 'harmonic' foundation for most South Asian music	is	the  drone , a held open fifth (or fourth) that does not alter in pitch throughout the course of a composition
Pitch simultaneity in particular	is	rarely

Some  traditions  of Western music  performance ,  composition , and  theory	have	specific rules of harmony
These rules	are described	as based on natural properties such as  Pythagorean tuning 's law whole number ratios ("harmoniousness" being inherent in the ratios either perceptually or in themselves) or  harmonics  and  resonances  ("harmoniousness" being inherent in the quality of sound), with the allowable pitches and harmonies
These rules	are described	often
harmoniousness	being	inherent in the ratios
either perceptually or in themselves) or  harmonics  and  resonances  ("harmoniousness	being	inherent in the quality of sound
the allowable pitches and harmonies	gaining	their beauty or simplicity
the allowable pitches and harmonies	gaining	from their closeness
Pythagorean ratios	can provide	a rough approximation of perceptual harmonicity
they	can not account	for cultural factors
these intervals	would preserve	the clarity of the original  plainsong
Early Western religious music	features	parallel perfect intervals
Early Western religious music	features	often

its dissonance	was associated	with the devil
composers	went	to considerable lengths
composers	went	often
the tritone	became	permissible

the standardization of  functional dissonance	made	its use in dominant chords desirable
Most harmony	comes	from two or more notes
two or more notes	sounding	simultaneously—but a work
Most harmony comes from two or more notes	can imply	harmony
These works	create	a sense of harmonies
many listeners	perceive	as being the bass note of a chord
Carl Dahlhaus	distinguishes	between "coordinate" and "subordinate harmony
Subordinate harmony	is	the  hierarchical   tonality  or tonal harmony well known today
the  hierarchical   tonality  or tonal harmony	well known	today
Coordinate harmony	is	the older  Medieval  and  Renaissance  "tonalité ancienne
The term	to signify	that sonorities are linked one after the other without giving rise to the impression of a goal-directed development
A first chord	forms	a 'progression' with a second chord, and a second with a third
the former chord progression	is	independent of the later one and vice versa
Coordinate harmony	follows direct	adjacent) relationships rather than
Interval cycles	create	symmetrical harmonies, which have been extensively used by the composers  Alban Berg ,  George Perle ,  Arnold Schoenberg ,  Béla Bartók , and  Edgard Varèse 's " Density 21.5 "
symmetrical harmonies	have been extensively used	by the composers
Close harmony and open harmony use	close respectively	position and open position chords
Other types of harmony	are based	upon the intervals of the chords
the chords	used	in that harmony
Most chords	used	in western music
Most chords used in western music	are based	on "tertian" harmony, or chords
chords	built	with the interval of thirds
G to B	is	a major third
E-G	is	a minor third
C-E	is	a major third
C-E	is	In the chord C Major7
Other types of harmony	consist	of  quartal harmony  and  quintal harmony
What's unique about unison	is	that it is two identical notes
it	is	two identical notes being played or sung together
Most people	only consider	thirds and fifths and sevenths to be "harmony
unison	does count	as harmony
unison	is especially	very important in orchestration
unison singing	is called	doubling" which is what  The Beatles  used to do a lot in their early music
unison singing	is called	In Pop music

An  interval	is	the relationship between two separate musical pitches
An interval	is the relationship between	two separate musical pitches
the first two notes (the first "twinkle") and the second two notes	are	at the interval of one fifth
the first two notes (the first "twinkle") and the second two notes	are	in the melody
What this means	is	that if the first two notes were the pitch C, the second two notes would be the pitch "G"—four scale notes, or seven chromatic notes
the first two notes	were	the pitch C
the second two notes	would be	the pitch
the combination of notes with their specific intervals	creates	harmony
The note C	is	the root
The notes E and G	provide	harmony
the root G with each subsequent note	provide	the harmony
Each pitch	is referred	to
Each pitch	is referred	as a "degree" of the scale
The names A, B, C, D, E, F, and G	are	insignificant
no note	corresponds	to a certain degree of the scale
no note	corresponds	always
The "tonic", or 1st-degree note	can be	any of the 12 notes
All the other notes	fall	into place
C	is	the tonic
the fourth degree or subdominant	is	F.
the fourth degree or subdominant	is	when C is the tonic
D	is	the tonic
the fourth degree	is	G.
the fourth degree	is	When D is the tonic
the note names	remain	constant
they	may refer	to different scale degrees
they	may refer to different scale degrees implying	different intervals
the intervals	surpass	the perfect Octave
these intervals	are called	compound intervals", which include particularly the 9th, 11th, and 13th
It	is as long	the same piece of music
The great power of this fact	is	that any musical work can be played or sung in any key
any musical work	can be played	in any key
any musical work	sung	in any key
compound intervals	include	particularly the 9th, 11th, and 13th
13th	Intervals—widely used	in  jazz  and  blues  Music
the intervals	are transposing	the melody
the intervals	are transposing	into the corresponding key
It	is the same piece of	music
The reason the two numbers don't "add"	correctly is	that one note is counted twice
one note	is counted	twice
consonant intervals	produce	a sensation of relaxation and dissonant intervals
dissonance	requires	resolution
the term consonant	means	brings resolution
the term consonant	means	In tonal music
An interval	is referred as perfect	when the harmonic relationship is found in the natural overtone series
the harmonic relationship	is found	in the natural overtone series
the harmonic relationships	are not found	mathematically exact in the overtone series
its function	is	contrapuntal
a major seventh interval alone	may be perceived	as dissonant
the same interval as part of a major seventh chord	may sound	relatively consonant
It	should be noted	that the effect of dissonance is perceived relatively within musical context: for example, a major seventh interval alone (i.e. C up to B) may be perceived as dissonant, but the same interval as part of a major seventh chord may sound relatively consonant
the effect of dissonance	is perceived	relatively within musical context
A tritone	sounds alone	very dissonant
harmony	is manipulated	using  chords

A chord with three members	is called	a  triad
A chord with three members	is called	because it has three members, not because it is necessarily built in thirds
it	has	three members
chords	built	with other intervals
chords	are named	by their root plus various terms and characters
chords	are named	In popular and jazz harmony

the members	are	A
the members	are	In an A chord
chords	are augmented	with "tensions
chords	are augmented	In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern and jazz
chords	are augmented	often
A tension	is	an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass
an additional chord member	creates	a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass
the simplest first tension	is added	to a triad
the simplest first tension	called	a " seventh chord
the individual thirds	stacked	to build the chord
Depending on the widths of the individual thirds	may be	major, minor, or diminished
The interval of an augmented seventh reproduces the root	is left	out of the chordal nomenclature
The nomenclature	allows	that, by default, "C7" indicates a chord with a root, third, fifth, and seventh spelled C, E, G, and B.
C7	indicates	a chord with a root, third, fifth, and seventh spelled C, E, G, and B.
C	augmented	7

Continuing to stack thirds on top of a seventh chord	produces	extensions
Continuing to stack thirds on top of a seventh chord	brings	in
Continuing to stack thirds on top of a seventh chord	brings	the "extended tensions" or "upper tensions" (those more than an octave above the root when stacked in thirds), the ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths
This	creates	the chords named after them
the chords	named	after them
Extensions beyond the thirteenth	reproduce	existing chord members
Complex harmonies	based	on  extended chords
Complex harmonies	are found	in abundance in jazz, late-romantic music, modern orchestral works, film music, etc.
there	is a balance between	the consonant
that	occurs	when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments
there	is a balance between	"tense
usually tension	is	prepared
consonant chords	lead smoothly	to the dissonant chord
the composer	ensures	introducing tension smoothly, without disturbing the listener
the composer	ensures introducing smoothly	tension
the composer	ensures introducing smoothly without disturbing	the listener
the piece	reaches	its sub-climax
a consonant chord	resolves	the tension of the previous chords
the listener	needs	a moment of relaxation
the listener	needs	to clear up the tension
the listener	needs	Once the piece reaches its sub-climax
the listener	needs a moment of relaxation to clear up	the tension, which is obtained by playing a consonant chord
the tension	is obtained	by playing a consonant chord
The clearing of this tension	sounds	pleasant to the listener
The clearing of this tension	sounds	usually
this	is not	always
this	is not	the case in late-nineteenth century music, such as Tristan und Isolde by Richard Wagner
Harmony	is based	on consonance
a concept	has changed	various times
a concept	has changed	during the history of Western music
consonance	is	a continuous variable
consonance	is	In a psychological approach
Consonance	can vary	across a wide range
A chord	may sound	consonant
A chord	may sound	for various reasons
One	is	lack of perceptual roughness
One	is lack of	perceptual roughness
Roughness	happens	when partials (frequency components) lie within a critical bandwidth
partials	lie	within a critical bandwidth
a critical bandwidth	is	a measure of the ear's ability
which	is a measure of	the ear
Critical bandwidth	lies	between 2 and 3 semitones at high frequencies
Critical bandwidth	becomes	larger
Critical bandwidth	becomes	at lower frequencies
The roughness of two simultaneous harmonic complex tones	depends	on the amplitudes of the harmonics
The roughest interval in the chromatic scale	is	the minor second and its inversion
the second roughest interval	is	second and minor seventh
the central range	followed	by the tritone
The second reason	is	perceptual fusion
its overall spectrum	is	similar to a  harmonic series
These differences	may not be	readily apparent
These differences	may not be	in tempered contexts
these comparisons	depend	on style
The third reason	is	familiarity
Chords	have been heard	in musical contexts
Chords	have been heard	often
Chords that have often been heard in musical contexts	tend	to sound more consonant
Chords that have often been heard in musical contexts	to sound	more consonant
This principle	explains	the gradual historical increase in harmonic complexity of Western music
around 1600 unprepared seventh chords	gradually became	familiar
around 1600 unprepared seventh chords	were therefore gradually perceived	as more consonant
Western music	is based	on major and minor triads
these chords	are	so central
they	include	the perfect fourth/fifth interval
The reason why these chords are so central	is	that they are consonant in terms of both fusion and lack of roughness
they	are	consonant
they	fuse	because they include the perfect fourth/fifth interval
They	lack	roughness
They	lack	because they lack major and minor second intervals
they	lack	major and minor second intervals
No other combination of three tones in the chromatic scale	satisfies	these criteria
the way	seen	in 'common practice' harmony
the tonic chord	may be	a dominant seventh chord
the tonic chord	may be	In a jazz or blues song
