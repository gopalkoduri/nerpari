{"sentence": "Chatravarishach.chhat-Raga Nirupanam authored by Narada lists ten main ragas and accepts the Kambhoji as the spouse of seventh raga called Raga Nata-Narayana."}

{"sentence": "The Anupa-Sangit-Ratanakar by Sangit Acharya Bhava-Bhata lists 20 ragas as being fundamental ragas."}
{"sentence": "The third raga of his scheme , called Kedar Raga , includes more than a dozen of raginis -- the seventh being the well known Kambhoji."}
{"sentence": "Raja Tulaji , the ruler of Tanjore has written a well known book on musicology known as Sangit-Saramritoddhar."}
{"sentence": "Raja Tulaji assumes 21 Janakmelas and includes Kambhoji and Yadukul-Kambhoji as the Jana ragas under the eighth Janaka-mela of his scheme of classification."}
{"sentence": "Most of the references above are comparatively recent but this should not be taken to mean that raga Kambhoji is also of recent origin."}
{"sentence": "Reference to this raga as Thakkesi is in the ancient Tamil epic Cilappatikaram which is referred by the sanskrit name kamboji."}
{"sentence": "Brihaddesi authored by Sangit Acharya Matanga Muni is the most important work between Natyashastra and Sangita Makarand."}
{"sentence": "Sage Matanga probably hailed from south India."}
{"sentence": "This Brihaddesi work is dated between 5th and 7th century AD but unfortunately it is incomplete."}
{"sentence": "Portions of it appear to have lost down the road."}
{"sentence": "Matangas Brihaddeshi is the first major and available text to describe the Ragas as we understand them today."}
{"sentence": "Sangit Acharya Matanga informs us that a classical melody can not be composed of four notes or less."}
{"sentence": "But the melodies used by the tribes such as the Sabara , Pulinda , Kamboja , Vanga , Kirata , Vahlika , Andhra , Dravida and the Vanachra clans or tribes are an exception which contain four svaras or notes."}
{"sentence": "This evidence by Sangit Acharya Matanga indisputably attests the existence of Kamboji Raga in its basic form before 5th/6th century AD."}
{"sentence": "Now , raga Kambhoji is stated to be deshi raga and a jana raga."}
{"sentence": "According to ancient references , the name of deshi ragas originated from the name of the countries or deshas."}
{"sentence": "The author of Sangit-Ratnavali also attests that :."}
{"sentence": "Encyclopaedia Britannica also observes : The author of the Brihaddeshi claims to be the first to discuss the term raga in any detail."}
{"sentence": "The ragas of this period seem to have been named after the different peoples living in various parts of the country , suggesting that their origin might lie in folk music."}
{"sentence": "cf : One of Sage Matangas major contributions to musicology is his scholarly focus on the regional element in music."}
{"sentence": "Deshi has to be understood in contrast to Margi music , which is sacred and pan-Indian in its scope."}
{"sentence": "According to Matanga , Deshi is that which is sung voluntarily and with delight and pleasure by women , children , cowherds and kings in their respective regions."}
{"sentence": "Deshi music captured the flavour of a range of human emotions from different regions."}
{"sentence": "Narada , the author of Sangit Makarand also hints on the uniqueness of the raga-nomenclaturing."}
{"sentence": "On close study of it , one learns of three distinct stages on the nomenclaturing of the Indian ragas."}
{"sentence": "Sangit-Makrand also classifies the ragas according to their gender i.e. Male Ragas , Female Ragas and Neuter Ragas."}
{"sentence": "According to Narada , the Male Ragas depict emotions of Raudra , Veera and Bhayanaka ; the Female Ragas represent sentiments of Shringara , Hasya and Karuna ; while the Neuter Ragas represent emotions of Vibhatsa , Adbhuta and Shanta."}
{"sentence": "Each raga is principally dominated by one of these nine rasas or sentiments , although the performer can also bring out other emotions in a less prominent way."}
{"sentence": "The more closely the notes of a raga conform to the expression of one single idea or emotion , the more overwhelming the effect of the raga."}
{"sentence": "Since the Raga Kambhoji has been classified as Female Raga , this Raga is particularly suitable in conveying the sentiments of Shringara , Hasya and Karuna."}
{"sentence": "From the foregoing discussion we clearly notice that raga or ragini Kambhoji which is now extremely popular in southern India was connected , in its original or basic form , with Kamboja or Kambhoja land."}
{"sentence": "It had originated in the ancient Kamboja jana or janapada located in north-west India."}
{"sentence": "It is very difficult to speak with confidence about the period when this basic Kambhoji tune had first entered Indian mainland."}
{"sentence": "It is highly probable , though , that when the Kamboja , Saka , Yavana , Pahlava and Rishika tribes had entered Indian mainland during 2nd/1st century BCE and spread into Sindhu , Sauvira , Rajasthan , Punjab , Gujarat and southern India , the Kambojas might have carried the basic Kamboji tune into these regions."}
{"sentence": "Or alternatively , the wandering Indian musicians & minstrels travelling through various regions of the north-west might have heard of the Kambhoji , adopted its basic tune and modified & evolved it further."}
{"sentence": "Thus , we see that there are various forms of this ancient raga prevalent in the north , western and southern India."}
{"sentence": "Kambhoji is a sort of parent scale much like Bilawal or Kalyan."}
{"sentence": "According to some writers , it is one of the earliest known modes dating back to the Samaveda and its original name was Kamboja described by Matanga."}
{"sentence": "Later authors refer to it variously as Kambhoji , Kambodi , Kambhodi , Kambodhi , Khambodi , Kamodi , Kamoda , Khambaj etc. etc.."}
{"sentence": "In the south it is now variously called Kambhodi , Khambhodi , Kambhoji , Khambhoji , Kambhojika etc. while in the north it is also known as Kamboji , Khambaj or Khamaj."}
{"sentence": "Linguistically , the names Kambodi , Khambodi and Khambaj can all be derived from Kamboji , Kamboja or Kambhojika."}
{"sentence": "One critic remarks cryptically that raga Khamaj not only turns flower red with passion , but also makes the antelopes musty."}
{"sentence": "Khamaj is still a popular and sensual raga , which is performed mainly in thumri and other genres , including hori-dhamar."}
{"sentence": ""}
{"sentence": "Other related raga is Khambavati , said to be connected with the port of Kambavati , southern Gujarat."}
{"sentence": "Place name Cambay or Kambati , Khambati or Kambavati is said to be connected with ancient Kambojas."}
{"sentence": "There are numerous scholars who have connected syllable Kambi or Kamba of Kambhavati with the Kambojas of north-west."}
{"sentence": "There was place name called Kambhavati in Maharashtra also."}
{"sentence": "Obviously , this name Khambavati is also a modified form of ancient tribal name Kamboja and may have been connected with the ancient Kambojas."}
{"sentence": "Raga Khambavati is commonly portrayed as a lady worshipping the four-headed Brahma by performing an ancient fire ritual."}
{"sentence": "In Punjab and northern India , the variant of Kambhoji is also called Kamodi or Kamoda."}
{"sentence": "The raga is also referenced as such in Sri Guru Granth Sahib , the Shabad Guru of the Sikhs."}
{"sentence": "Besides the above version of Kambhoji , the other forms like Hari-Kamboji , Yadukula-Kamboji , Dombuli-Kamboji , Gopi-Kamboji and Senchu or Chencho-Kamboji , Erugala-Kambhoji , Siva Kamboji etc. are also in currency."}
{"sentence": "Sanskrit Kamboja vs Cambodia and the raga Kambhoji."}
{"sentence": "It is often stated by some writers that ancient Sanskrit name Kamboja refers to Cambodia."}
{"sentence": "This is not true."}
{"sentence": "The earliest attestation of term Kambuja for Cambodia appears in the Baksei Chamkron Inscriptions of Cambodia date 869 AD."}
{"sentence": "But the Kamboja country and people located in north-west India as referred to in ancient Sanskrit texts go back to remote antiquity."}
{"sentence": "Based on the similar misconception , some people also attribute the origin of raga Kamboji to Cambodia."}
{"sentence": "This again is wrong."}
{"sentence": "Raga Kamboji being a jana raga is now believed by numerous scholars to have originated during the jana stage which stage had preceded the janapada stage in Indian history."}
{"sentence": "Thus basic tune of raga Kambhoji must have originated in the epic stage which had preceded the Buddhist period."}
{"sentence": "On the contrary , the Indian colonisation of Kambuja had occurred not earlier than 5th century ADE."}
{"sentence": "Hence it is wrong to assume that raga Kambhoji had originated in Kambuja or Cambodia and it got its name from that country."}
{"sentence": "Scholars like O. P. Ganguli and Dr J. L. Kamboj believe that the Kambhoji raga or ragini had originated in the jana rather than the janapada stage."}
{"sentence": "This implies that the basic tune of Kambhoji must have evolved during epic or even in pre-epic times."}
{"sentence": "Hence its origin must be attributed to the ancient Kamboja jana and janapada known to have been located in north-east Afghanistan."}
{"sentence": "Dr V. V. Srivatsa wrote the following in his notes on Raga Surati :."}
{"sentence": "But a little later , Dr V. V. Srivatsa wrote the following in his notes on Raga Yadukula-Kambhoji :."}
{"sentence": "It needs to be remembered here that the Puranic list of 56 countries of the Bhuvana-kosha spanned seven divisions of ancient Indian subcontinent."}
{"sentence": "The Uttarapatha was one of these seven divisions and had extended from Pehova in Haryana to as far as deep into the Central Asia."}
{"sentence": "The Kamboja was one of the Bhuvana-kosha countries and it adjoined the Daradas , Chinas , Tusharas , Pahlavas , Shakas etc. which were all included in the Uttarapatha division."}
{"sentence": "This shows that Kambhoji of Dr V. V. Srivatsa refers to the Kamboja of Uttarapatha located between river Kabol and the Hindukush mountain ranges."}
{"sentence": "It is therefore , fair that Dr Srivatsa had soon corrected his mistake."}
{"sentence": "Encyclopedia of Indian Culture observes : `` Raga Sauvira is believed to have emanated from Sauvira , raga Andhari from Andhara , raga Gandhari from Gandhara , raga Kambhoji from Kambhoja , raga Sanidhavi foim Saindhava or the Sindhu or Indus region , raga Karnataki from Karnataka , raga Gaudi from Gauda , raga Khamhavati from Khambayat , raga Daksinatya from Deksina region...... etc. ''."}
{"sentence": "Shri Chandrasekarendra Saraswati , Paramacharya of Kanchi has given his scholarly views on the origin of raga Kambhoji."}

{"sentence": "Another noted musicologist from Carnatica , Shri P. P. Narayanaswami , also rejects the Kambhoji connection with Cambodia."}
{"sentence": "Rather he likes to connect it with the Indian Kamboja located in north or north-west of India."}
{"sentence": "His views on the precise location of Kamboja however seem to be in little error."}
{"sentence": "According to Amir Khusrau Memorial Volume , in olden days the regions or Desh formed independent cultural entities."}
{"sentence": "The Gandhara and Kamboja lay beyond the western borders , Multan and Delhi in the west , Mithila and Gauda in the east , Ujjain and Malava on the road to south , Gurjar Desh by the sea and Simhala Desh and Karnataka in the south."}
{"sentence": "In these various regions arose regional tunes the most prominent and enduring among them were Gandhari , Kamboji , Multani , Gauda , Malava Pancam , Gurjari etc.."}
{"sentence": ""}

{"sentence": "Saka Raga was a melody known as Sadharana Giti."}
{"sentence": "Saka Misrv and Kamboji were allied with the Kukuva Raga indicating thereby the foreign antecedents of the latter."}
{"sentence": "Raga Kamboji , of course , was contributed by the Kamboja people."}
{"sentence": "Kamboji is mentioned along with the Saka-Misrita... It is also important to note that the same author locates the Kambojas and Sakas in the north-west division."}

{"sentence": "For practical use , all these types are called tanpura in the text."}
{"sentence": "The body shape of the tanpura somewhat resembles that of the sitar , but it has no frets - as the strings are always plucked at their full lengths."}
{"sentence": "One or more tanpuras may be used to accompany vocalists or instrumentalists."}
{"sentence": "It has four or five wire strings , which are plucked one after another in a regular pattern to create a harmonic resonance on the basic note or keynote."}
{"sentence": "Tanpuras form the root of the ensemble and indeed of the music itself , as the tanpura creates an acoustic dynamic reference chord from which the ragas derive their distinctive character , color and flavor."}
{"sentence": "Concerning its history , a quote from A. D. Ranade : The first unambiguous reference to the tanpura is in Sangit Parijat."}
{"sentence": "It is neither mentioned by the earlier texts nor does it find a place in sculptures."}
{"sentence": "An electronic tanpura , a small box that imitates the sound of a tanpura , is often used in contemporary Indian classical music performances instead of , or in addition to a tanpura."}
{"sentence": "Tanpuras come in different sizes and pitches : larger males , smaller females for vocalists , and a yet smaller version is used for accompanying sitar or sarod , called tamburi."}
{"sentence": "Male vocalists pitch their tonic note , often at C # ; female singers usually a fifth higher , though these tonic notes may vary according to the preference of the singer , as there is no absolute and fixed pitch-reference in the Indian classical music systems."}
{"sentence": "The male instrument has an open string length of approximately one metre ; the female is three-fourths of the male."}
{"sentence": "The standard tuning is 5-8-8-1 or , in Indian sargam , PA-sa-sa-SA."}
{"sentence": "For ragas that omit the fifth tone , pa , the first string is tuned down to the natural fourth : 4-8-8-1 or Ma-sa-sa-Sa."}
{"sentence": "Some ragas require a less common tuning with shuddh NI , NI-sa-sa-SA."}
{"sentence": "With a five-string instrument , the seventh or NI can be added : PA-NI-sa-sa-SA or MA-NI-sa-sa-SA."}
{"sentence": "The name tanapura is probably derived from tana , referring to a musical phrase , and pura , which means full or complete."}
{"sentence": "Both in its musical function and how it works , the tanpura is unique in many ways."}
{"sentence": "It does not partake in the melodic part of the music , but it supports and sustains the melody by providing a colourful and dynamic harmonic resonance field based on one precise tone , the basic note or key note."}
{"sentence": "Also , it is not played in rhythm with the music , as the precise timing of plucking a cycle of four strings in a continuous loop is a determinant factor in the resultant sound."}
{"sentence": "The special overtone-rich sound and the audible movement in the inner resonances of tone is achieved by applying the principle of jivari or jawari which creates a sustained buzzing sound in which particular harmonics will resonate with focused clarity."}
{"sentence": "Jiva refers to soul , that which gives life , implying that the tanpura embodies an animated tone quality."}
{"sentence": "Another linguistic reference is sawari which means saddle."}
{"sentence": "The principle of jivari can be compared to the prismatic refraction of white light into the colours of the rainbow , as its acoustic twin principle at work , amplifying the inner resonances of a tone to audible harmonics."}
{"sentence": "To achieve this effect , the strings pass over a wide , arched bridge , the front of which slopes gently away from the surface of the strings."}
{"sentence": "When a string is plucked , it has an intermittent periodical grazing contact with the bridge ; this intermittent grazing of the string on the curved bridge will move around in the sonation process , as the points of contact will gradually shift , being a compound function of amplitude , the curvature of the bridge , pitch and string tension."}
{"sentence": "When the string is plucked , it has a large amplitude , moving up and down and contacting the bridge on the down-phase."}
{"sentence": "As the energy of the strings movement gradually diminishes , the contact point of the string with the bridge slowly creeps up the slope of the bridge like a wave out of the sea spending itself on the beach."}
{"sentence": "Depending on scale and pitch , this can take between three and ten seconds."}
{"sentence": "This dynamic process can be fine-tuned using a cotton thread between string and bridge : by shifting the thread , the grazing contact sequence is shifted to a different position on the bridge , changing the harmonic content."}
{"sentence": "Every single string produces its own cascading range of harmonics and , at the same time , builds up a particular resonance."}
{"sentence": "According to this principle , tanpuras are attentively tuned to achieve a particular tonal shade relative to the tonal characteristics of the raga."}
{"sentence": "These more delicate aspects of tuning are directly related to what Indian musicians call raga svaroop , which is about how characteristic intonations are important defining aspects of a particular raga."}
{"sentence": "The tanpuras particular setup , with the cotton thread as a variable focus-point , made it possible to explore a multitude of harmonic relations produced by the subtle harmonic interplay in time of its four strings"}
{"sentence": "The Kamalamba Navavarana Kritis by Shri Muthuswami Dikshitar are some of the most famous pieces of music in the Carnatic system of Indian classical music."}

{"sentence": "They are very elaborate compositions which may be well compared with major symphonies in the Western system."}
{"sentence": "These songs are set in praise of the Goddess Kamalamba who is enshrined in Tiruvarur in the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu in South India."}
{"sentence": "The Goddess is the reference to the Divine Mother of the universe , or the Supreme Consciousness."}
{"sentence": "The lyrics and the descriptive details are loaded with the mystical symbolism of the Vedantic tradition and the chakras of the human system are closely linked to the evolutionary aspects described in the compositions that reflect the scholarly reach , musical depth and mystical significance of the composer."}
{"sentence": "Musically , they are par excellence and the majestic sweep of well known ragas like Todi , Kalyani , Kambhoji , Sankarabharanam , Sahana , Anandabhairavi and Bhairavi are offset against haunting melodies in lesser known ragas like Punnagavarali , Ghanta and Ahiri."}
{"sentence": "Dikshitar uses several talas although Rupakam seems to be his favourite."}
{"sentence": "Ata talam and Misra Jampa in the Kambhoji and Bhairavi pieces are rarely used because of the technical difficulty in executing these."}
{"sentence": "An added element is the use of different case endings."}

{"sentence": "The ninth avarana kriti in Ahiri has all the cases ; interestingly the raga itself has all the 22 Sruti in the octave."}
{"sentence": "It is believed that such a fusion of all melodic and temporal elements in the same kriti is a musical way of expressing the advaitic ideal of aham Brahmasmi or complete union with the Absolute."}

{"sentence": "The set concludes with a short and sweet mangalam in Sri ragam set in Khanda Ekam."}

{"sentence": "The main traditional forms of improvisation in Carnatic music consist of the following."}
{"sentence": "An alapana , sometimes also called ragam , is the exposition of a raga or tone - a slow improvisation with no rhythm , where the raga acts as the basis of embellishment."}
{"sentence": "In performing alapana , performers consider each raga as an object that has beginnings and endings and consists somehow of sequences of thought."}
{"sentence": "The performer will explore the ragam and touch on its various nuances , singing in the lower octaves first , then gradually moving up to higher octaves , while giving a hint of the song to be performed."}
{"sentence": "Theoretically , this ought to be the easiest type of improvisation , since the rules are so few , but in fact , it takes much skill to sing a pleasing , comprehensive and , most importantly , original raga alapana."}
{"sentence": "Niraval , usually performed by the more advanced performers , consists of singing one or two lines of text of a song repeatedly , but with a series of melodic improvised elaborations."}
{"sentence": "Although niraval consists of extempore melodic variations , generally , the original patterns of duration are maintained ; each word in the lines of text stay set within their original place in the tala cycle."}
{"sentence": "The lines are then also played at different levels of speed which can include double speed , triple speed , quadruple speed and even sextuple speed."}
{"sentence": "The improvised elaborations are made with a view of outlining the raga , the tempo , and the theme of the composition."}
{"sentence": "Kalpanaswaram , also known as swarakalpana , consists of improvising melodic and rhythmic passages using swaras."}
{"sentence": "Like niraval , kalpanaswaras are sung to end on a particular swara in the raga of the melody and at a specific place in the tala cycle."}
{"sentence": "Kalpanaswaras have a somewhat predictable rhythmical structure ; the swaras are sung to end on the samam."}
{"sentence": "The swaras can also be sung at the same speed or double the speed of the melody that is being sung , though some artists sing triple-speed phrases too."}
{"sentence": "Kalpanaswaram is the most elementary type of improvisation , usually taught before any other form of improvisation."}
{"sentence": "Tanam is one of the most important forms of improvisation , and is integral to Ragam Tanam Pallavi."}
{"sentence": "Originally developed for the veena , it consists of expanding the raga with syllables like tha , nam , thom , aa , nom , na , etc.."}
{"sentence": "Ragam , Tanam , and Pallavi are the principal long form in concerts , and is a composite form of improvisation."}
{"sentence": "As the name suggests , it consists of raga alapana , tanam , and a pallavi line."}
{"sentence": "Set to a slow-paced tala , the pallavi line is often composed by the performer."}
{"sentence": "Through niraval , the performer manipulates the pallavi line in complex melodic and rhythmic ways."}
{"sentence": "The niraval is followed by kalpanaswarams."}

{"sentence": "A Carnatic composition really has two elements , one being the musical element , the other being what is conveyed in the composition."}
{"sentence": "It is probably because of this fact that most Carnatic music compositions are composed for singing."}
{"sentence": "In addition to the rich musical experience , each composition brings out the knowledge and personality of the composer , and hence the words are as important as the musical element itself."}
{"sentence": "This poses a special challenge for the musicians because rendering this music does not involve just playing or singing the correct musical notes ; the musicians are expected to understand what was conveyed by the composer in various languages , and sing musical phrases that act to create the effect that was intended by the composer in his/her composition."}
{"sentence": "Geethams and swarajatis are principally meant to serve as basic learning exercises."}
{"sentence": "Compositions more commonly associated with Indian classical dance and Indian devotional music have also been increasingly used in the Carnatic music repertoire."}
{"sentence": "The performance of the Sanskrit sloka , Tamil viruttam and Telegu padyamu or sisapadya forms are particularly unique."}
{"sentence": "Though these forms consist of lyric-based verses , musicians improvise raga phrases in free rhythm , like an alapana , so both the sound value , and the meaning of the text , guide the musician through elaborate melodic improvisations."}
{"sentence": "Forms such as the divya prabandham , thevaram and ugabhoga are often performed similarly , however , these forms can also have a set melody and rhythm like the devaranama , javali , padam , thillana and thiruppugazh forms."}

{"sentence": "Known for their complex structure , varnams are a fundamental form in Carnatic music."}
{"sentence": "Varnams are practised as vocal exercises in multiple speeds by performers of Carnatic music , to help develop voice culture , and maintain proper pitch and control of rhythm."}

{"sentence": "Carnatic songs are varied in structure and style , but generally consist of three units :."}
{"sentence": "This kind of song is called a keerthanam or a kriti."}

{"sentence": "The compositions of these composers are rendered frequently by artists of today."}
{"sentence": "Composers of Carnatic music were often inspired by religious devotion and were usually scholars proficient in one or more of the languages Kannada , Malayalam , Sanskrit , Tamil , or Telugu."}
{"sentence": "They usually included a signature , called a mudra , in their compositions."}
{"sentence": "For example , all songs by Tyagaraja have the word Tyagaraja in them , all songs by Muthuswami Dikshitar have the words Guruguha in them ; songs by Syama Sastri have the words Syama Krishna in them ; while Purandaradasa , who composed in Kannada , used the signature Purandara Vittala."}
{"sentence": "Gopalakrishna Bharathi used the signature Gopalakrishnan and composed in Tamil."}

{"sentence": "Carnatic music is traditionally taught according to the system formulated by Purandara Dasa."}
{"sentence": "This involves varisais , alankaras , geetams or simple songs , and Swarajatis."}
{"sentence": "After the student has reached a certain standard , varnams are taught and later , the student learns kritis."}
{"sentence": "It typically takes several years of learning before a student is adept enough to perform at a concert."}
{"sentence": "The learning texts and exercises are more or less uniform across all the South Indian states."}
{"sentence": "The learning structure is arranged in increasing order of complexity."}
{"sentence": "The lessons start with the learning of the sarali varisai."}
{"sentence": "Carnatic music was traditionally taught in the gurukula system , where the student lived with and learnt the art from his guru."}
{"sentence": "From the late 20th century onwards , with changes in lifestyles and need for young music aspirants to simultaneously pursue a parallel academic career , this system has found few takers."}
{"sentence": "Musicians often take great pride in letting people know about their Guru Parampara , or the hierarchy of disciples from some prominent ancient musician or composer , to which they belong."}
{"sentence": "People whose disciple-hierarchies are often referred to are Tyagaraja , Muthuswami Dikshitar , Syama Sastri , Swathi Thirunal and Papanasam Sivan , among others."}
{"sentence": "In modern times , it is common for students to visit their gurus daily or weekly to learn music."}
{"sentence": "Though new technology has made learning easier with the availability of quick-learn media such as learning exercises recorded on audio cassettes and CDs , these are discouraged by most gurus who emphasize that face-to-face learning is best for students."}
{"sentence": "Notation is not a new concept in Indian music."}
{"sentence": "However , Carnatic music continued to be transmitted orally for centuries without being written down."}

{"sentence": "They contain snippets of solfege to be used when performing the mentioned ragas."}
{"sentence": "Unlike classical Western music , Carnatic music is notated almost exclusively in tonic sol-fa notation using either a Roman or Indic script to represent the solfa names."}
{"sentence": "Past attempts to use the staff notation have mostly failed."}
{"sentence": "Indian music makes use of hundreds of ragas , many more than the church modes in Western music."}
{"sentence": "It becomes difficult to write Carnatic music using the staff notation without the use of too many accidentals."}
{"sentence": "Furthermore , the staff notation requires that the song be played in a certain key."}
{"sentence": "The notions of key and absolute pitch are deeply rooted in Western music , whereas the Carnatic notation does not specify the key and prefers to use scale degrees to denote notes."}
{"sentence": "The singer is free to choose the actual pitch of the tonic note."}
{"sentence": "In the more precise forms of Carnatic notation , there are symbols placed above the notes indicating how the notes should be played or sung ; however , informally this practice is not followed."}
{"sentence": "To show the length of a note , several devices are used."}
{"sentence": "If the duration of note is to be doubled , the letter is either capitalized or lengthened by a diacritic."}
{"sentence": "For a duration of three , the letter is capitalized and followed by a comma."}
{"sentence": "For a length of four , the letter is capitalized and then followed by a semicolon."}
{"sentence": "In this way any duration can be indicated using a series of semicolons and commas."}
{"sentence": "However , a simpler notation has evolved which does not use semicolons and capitalization , but rather indicates all extensions of notes using a corresponding number of commas."}
{"sentence": "Thus , Sa quadrupled in length would be denoted as S , ,."}
{"sentence": "The notation is divided into columns , depending on the structure of the talam."}

{"sentence": "The rhythm accompanist is usually a mridangam player."}
{"sentence": "However , other percussion instruments such as the ghatam , kanjira and morsing frequently also accompany the main percussion instrument and play in an almost contrapuntal fashion along with the beats."}
{"sentence": "The objective of the accompanying instruments is far more than following the melody and keeping the beats."}
{"sentence": "The accompaniments form an integral part of every composition presented , and they closely follow and augment the melodic phrases outlined by the lead singer."}
{"sentence": "The vocalist and the violinist take turns while elaborating or while exhibiting creativity in sections like raga , niraval and kalpanaswaram."}
{"sentence": "Unlike Hindustani music concerts , where an accompanying tabla player can keep beats without following the musical phrases at times , in Carnatic music , the accompanists have to follow the intricacies of the composition since there are percussion elements such as eduppu in several compositions."}
{"sentence": "Some concerts feature a good bit of interaction with the lead musicians and accompanists exchanging notes , and accompanying musicians predicting the lead singers musical phrases."}
{"sentence": "A contemporary Carnatic music concert usually lasts about three hours , and comprises a number of varied compositions."}

{"sentence": "The performer must improvise a string of swaras in any octave according to the rules of the raga and return to beginning of the cycle of beats smoothly , joining the swaras with a phrase selected from the kriti."}
{"sentence": "The violin performs these alternately with the main performer."}
{"sentence": "In very long strings of swara , the performers must calculate their notes accurately to ensure that they stick to the raga , have no awkward pauses or lapses in the beat of the song , and create a complex pattern of notes that a knowledgeable audience can follow."}
{"sentence": "Performers then begin the main compositions with a section called raga alapana exploring the raga."}
{"sentence": "In this , they use the sounds aa , ri , na , ta , etc. instead of swaras to slowly elaborate the notes and flow of the raga."}
{"sentence": "This begins slowly and builds to a crescendo , and finally establishes a complicated exposition of the raga that shows the performers skill."}
{"sentence": "All of this is done without any rhythmic accompaniment , or beat."}
{"sentence": "Then the melodic accompaniment , expounds the raga."}
{"sentence": "Experienced listeners can identify many ragas after they hear just a few notes."}
{"sentence": "With the raga thus established , the song begins , usually with lyrics."}
{"sentence": "In this , the accompaniment performs along with the main performer and the percussion."}
{"sentence": "In the next stage of the song , they may sing niraval or kalpanaswaram again."}
{"sentence": "In most concerts , the main item will at least have a section at the end of the item , for the percussion to perform solo."}

{"sentence": "As and when the artist exhibits creativity , the audience acknowledge it by clapping their hands."}

{"sentence": "Every December , the city of Chennai in India has its six week-long Music Season , which has been described as the worlds largest cultural event."}
{"sentence": "The Music Season was started in 1927 , to mark the opening of the Madras Music Academy."}

{"sentence": "The scales in this page are those proposed by Govindaacharya."}
{"sentence": "A hundred years after Venkatamakhins time the Katapayadi sankhya rule came to be applied to the nomenclature of the melakarta ragas."}
{"sentence": "The sankhya associates Sanskrit consonants with digits."}
{"sentence": "The digits corresponding to the first two syllables of the name of a raga , when reversed , give the index of the raga."}

{"sentence": "Also , R must necessarily precede G and D must precede N."}
{"sentence": "This gives 2 x 6 x 6 = 72 ragas."}

{"sentence": "This is obvious for ragas that have less than seven notes."}
{"sentence": "For such ragas it can be associated with a Melakarta which has any of the different swaras in that position."}
{"sentence": "For example , Hindolam has Rishabha and Panchama missing."}

{"sentence": "It is widely believed that the tabla , the mridangams Hindustani musical counterpart , was first constructed by splitting a mridangam in half."}

{"sentence": "The mridangam is a double-sided drum whose body is usually made using a hollowed piece of jackfruit wood about an inch thick."}
{"sentence": "The two mouths or apertures of the drum are covered with a goatskin and laced to each other with leather straps around the circumference of drum."}
{"sentence": "These straps are put into a state of high tension to stretch out the circular membranes on either side of the hull , allowing them to resonate when struck."}
{"sentence": "These two membranes are dissimilar in width to allow for the production of both bass and treble sounds from the same drum."}
{"sentence": "The bass aperture is known as the thoppi or eda bhaaga and the smaller aperture is known as the valanthalai or bala bhaaga."}
{"sentence": "The smaller membrane , when struck , produces higher pitched sounds with a metallic timbre."}
{"sentence": "The wider aperture produces lower pitched sounds."}
{"sentence": "The goat skin covering the smaller aperture is anointed in the center with a black disk made of rice flour , ferric oxide powder and starch."}
{"sentence": "This black tuning paste is known as the satham or karanai and gives the mridangam its distinct metallic timbre."}

{"sentence": "Pioneering work on the mathematics of these harmonics was done by Nobel Prize winning physicist C. V. Raman."}
{"sentence": "Immediately prior to use in a performance , the leather covering the wider aperture is made moist and a spot of paste made from rice flour and water is applied to the center , which lowers the pitch of the left membrane and gives it a very powerful resonating bass sound."}
{"sentence": "The artist tunes the instrument by varying the tension in the leather straps spanning the hull of the instrument."}
{"sentence": "This is achieved by placing the mridangam upright with its larger side facing down , and then striking the tension-bearing straps located along of circumference of the right membrane with a heavy object."}
{"sentence": "A wooden peg is sometimes placed between the stone and the mridangam during the tuning procedure to ensure that the force is exerted at precisely the point where it is needed."}
{"sentence": "Striking the periphery of the right membrane in the direction toward the hull raises the pitch , while striking the periphery from the opposite side lowers the pitch."}
{"sentence": "The pitch must be uniform and balanced at all points along the circumference of the valanthalai for the sound to resonate perfectly."}
{"sentence": "The pitch can be balanced with the aid of a pitch pipe or a tambura."}
{"sentence": "The larger membrane can also be tuned in a similar manner , though it is not done as frequently."}
{"sentence": "Note that since the leather straps are interwoven between both the smaller and larger aperture , adjusting the tension on one side often can affect the tension on the other."}

{"sentence": "The combination of these finger strokes produces complex mathematical patterns that have both aesthetic and theoretical appeal."}
{"sentence": "Increasingly complex calculations and metres may be employed when the mridangam is played."}
{"sentence": "Classically , training is by dharmic apprenticeship and includes both the yoga of drum construction and an emphasis on the internal discipline of voicing mridangam tone and rhythm both syllabically and linguistically , in accordance with Rigveda , more than on mere performance."}
{"sentence": "Today the mridangam is most widely used in Carnatic music performances."}
