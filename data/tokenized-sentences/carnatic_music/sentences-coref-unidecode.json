{"sentence": "Also , it is not played in rhythm with the music , as the precise timing of plucking a cycle of four strings in a continuous loop is a determinant factor in the resultant sound."}
{"sentence": "The special overtone-rich sound and the audible movement in the inner resonances of tone is achieved by applying the principle of jivari or jawari which creates a sustained buzzing sound in which particular harmonics will resonate with focused clarity."}

{"sentence": "To achieve this effect , the strings pass over a wide , arched bridge , the front of which slopes gently away from the surface of the strings."}
{"sentence": "When a string is plucked , it has an intermittent periodical grazing contact with the bridge ; this intermittent grazing of the string on the curved bridge will move around in the sonation process , as the points of contact will gradually shift , being a compound function of amplitude , the curvature of the bridge , pitch and string tension."}
{"sentence": "When the string is plucked , it has a large amplitude , moving up and down and contacting the bridge on the down-phase."}
{"sentence": "As the energy of the strings movement gradually diminishes , the contact point of the string with the bridge slowly creeps up the slope of the bridge like a wave out of the sea spending itself on the beach."}
{"sentence": "Depending on scale and pitch , this can take between three and ten seconds."}
{"sentence": "This dynamic process can be fine-tuned using a cotton thread between string and bridge : by shifting the thread , the grazing contact sequence is shifted to a different position on the bridge , changing the harmonic content."}
{"sentence": "Every single string produces This dynamic process own cascading range of harmonics and , at the same time , builds up a particular resonance."}
{"sentence": "According to this principle , One or more tanpuras are attentively tuned to achieve a particular tonal shade relative to the tonal characteristics of the raga."}

{"sentence": "The scales in this page are those proposed by Govindaacharya."}
{"sentence": "A hundred years after Venkatamakhins time the Katapayadi sankhya rule came to be applied to the nomenclature of the melakarta ragas."}
{"sentence": "The sankhya associates Sanskrit consonants with digits."}
{"sentence": "The digits corresponding to the first two syllables of the name of a raga , when reversed , give the index of the raga."}
{"sentence": "Thus the scale of a melakarta raga can be easily derived from its name."}
{"sentence": "For example , Harikambhoji raga starts with syllables Ha and ri , which have numbers 8 and 2 associated with them."}

{"sentence": "A melakarta raga must necessarily have S and P , one of the Ms , one each of the Rs and Gs , and one each of the Ds and Ns."}
{"sentence": "Also , R must necessarily precede G and D must precede N."}
{"sentence": "This gives 2 x 6 x 6 = 72 ragas."}

{"sentence": "By following a simple set of rules we can find the corresponding raga and the scale associated with it."}

{"sentence": "This is obvious for ragas that have less than seven notes."}
{"sentence": "For such ragas This can be associated with a Melakarta which has any of the different swaras in that position."}
{"sentence": "For example , Hindolam has Rishabha and Panchama missing."}

{"sentence": "The two mouths or apertures of the drum are covered with a goatskin and laced to each other with leather straps around the circumference of drum."}
{"sentence": "These straps are put into a state of high tension to stretch out the circular membranes on either side of the hull , allowing them to resonate when struck."}
{"sentence": "These two membranes are dissimilar in width to allow for the production of both bass and treble sounds from the same drum."}
{"sentence": "The bass aperture is known as the thoppi or eda bhaaga and the smaller aperture is known as the valanthalai or bala bhaaga."}
{"sentence": "The smaller membrane , when struck , produces higher pitched sounds with a metallic timbre."}

{"sentence": "The goat skin covering the smaller aperture is anointed in the center with a black disk made of rice flour , ferric oxide powder and starch."}
{"sentence": "This black tuning paste is known as the satham or karanai and gives the mridangam its distinct metallic timbre."}

{"sentence": "Pioneering work on the mathematics of these harmonics was done by Nobel Prize winning physicist C. V. Raman."}
{"sentence": "Immediately prior to use in a performance , the leather covering the wider aperture is made moist and a spot of paste made from rice flour and water is applied to the center , which lowers the pitch of the left membrane and gives it a very powerful resonating bass sound."}
{"sentence": "The artist tunes the instrument by varying the tension in the leather straps spanning the hull of the instrument."}
{"sentence": "This is achieved by placing the mridangam upright with its larger side facing down , and then striking the tension-bearing straps located along of circumference of the right membrane with a heavy object."}
{"sentence": "A wooden peg is sometimes placed between the stone and the mridangam during the tuning procedure to ensure that the force is exerted at precisely the point where it is needed."}
{"sentence": "Striking the periphery of the right membrane in the direction toward the hull raises the pitch , while striking the periphery from the opposite side lowers the pitch."}
{"sentence": "The pitch must be uniform and balanced at all points along the circumference of the valanthalai for the sound to resonate perfectly."}
{"sentence": "The pitch can be balanced with the aid of a pitch pipe or a tambura."}
{"sentence": "The larger membrane can also be tuned in a similar manner , though The larger membrane is not done as frequently."}

{"sentence": "These performances take place all over Southern India and are now popular all over the world."}
