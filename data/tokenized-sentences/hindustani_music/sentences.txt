Ustad Vilayat Khan was one of India s well known sitar maestros .
He recorded his first 78-RPM disc at the age of 8 , and gave his last concert in 2004 at the age of 75 .
Vilayat Khan was born in Gauripur , British India to Enayat Khan , a sitar maestro .
His family of musicians trace their pedigree back to the court musicians of the Mughals .
His father , recognised as a leading sitar and surbahar player of his time , as had been the grandfather , Imdad Khan , before him .
He was taught in the family style , known as the Imdadkhani Gharana or Etawah Gharana , after small city close to Agra where Imdad Khan lived .
However , Enayat Khan died when Vilayat was only nine , so much of his education came from the rest of his family : his uncle , sitar and surbahar maestro Wahid Khan , his maternal grandfather , singer Bande Hassan Khan , and his mother , Bashiran Begum , who had studied the practice procedure of his forefathers .
His uncle Zinde Hassan looked after his riyaz .
As a boy , Vilayat wanted to be a singer ; but his mother , herself from a family of vocalists , felt he had a strong responsibility to bear the family torch as a sitar maestro .
Vilayat Khan performed at All Bengal Music Conference , as his first concert , organized by Bhupen Ghosh in Kolkata with Ahmed Jan Thirakwa on tabla .
His performance made headlines as Electrifying Sitar in Bombay next day of his concert organized by Vikramaditya Sangeet Parishad , Mumbai .
In the 1950s , Vilayat Khan worked closely with instrument makers , especially the famous sitar-makers Kanailal & Hiren Roy , to further develop the instrument .
Also , he liked to perform without a tanpura drone , filling out the silence with strokes to his chikari strings .
Some ragas he would somewhat re-interpret , others he invented himself , but he was first and foremost a traditional interpreter of grand , basic ragas such as Yaman , Shree , Todi , Darbari and Bhairavi .
When he died from lung cancer in 2004 , Vilayat Khan had been recording for over 65 years , broadcasting on All-India Radio since almost as far back and been seen as a master for 60 .
He had been touring outside India off and on for more than 50 years , and was probably the first Indian musician to play in England after independence .
In the 1990s , his recording career reached a climax of sorts with a series of ambitious CDs for India Archive Music in New York , some traditional , some controversial , some eccentric .
Towards the end of his life , he also performed and recorded sporadically on the surbahar .
He has performed duet concerts with maestros like Bismillah Khan , Ali Akbar Khan , brother Imrat Khan .
Khan composed and conducted the score for three feature films - Satyajit Rays Jalsaghar in Bengali , Merchant-Ivory Productions The Guru in English , and Madhusudan Kumars Kadambari in Hindi .
In addition to these , he also gave music for a little-known documentary film in Bengali produced by Dr. Barin Roy .
For Jalsaghar he won a Silver Medal for Composing at the 1st Moscow International Film Festival .
The Imdad Khan family is of Rajput lineage .
The family is of Hindu origin and later converted to Islam .
In an informal continuation of his rajput lineage Ustad Enayat Khan kept a Hindu name of Nath Singh .
Ustad Vilayat Khan himself composed many bandishes using the pen name Nath Piya .
Vilayat Khan spent much of his life living in Calcutta .
He was married twice .
He had three children from his first marriage - Sufi singer Zila Khan and Yaman Khan and Sitarist Shujaat .
From his second marriage he had one son Hidayat , also a professional Sitarist .
He was survived also by his younger brother , Imrat Khan , the post-war star of the surbahar field .
The brothers played celebrated duets in their youth , but had a severe falling-out and for years were not on speaking terms .
His nephew Ustad Rais Khan is also a star sitar-player .
Ustad Vilayat Khan took few disciples other than his sons ; among the best-known are Kashinath Mukherjee , Arvind Parikh , Kalyani Roy and Srimati Hasu Patel .

Mrs. Lakshmi Seshan now a teacher of the instrument in her 80th year was a student of Vilayat Khan starting at the age of 12 .
The Maestro also gave sitar lessons to Big Jim Sullivan , the famous English session musician .
Ustad-e-Maa Zila Khan , the great Sufi singer from the Imdad Khani Gharana and daughter of Ustad Vilayat Khan 's was a formal student and Ustad Vilayat Khan empowered her to also be a successor of this great Gharana .
She is the first and only woman of this gharana who performs public concerts and her CD 's are very popular with the masses and the intellects alike .
He enjoyed horse-riding , pool playing , swimming and ballroom dancing .
His successes made him rich , and though he grew more pious late in life , he used to drive sports cars and dress in haute couture , and also collected such various items as firearms , smoking pipes , antique European crockery , cut glass and chandeliers .
In an interview , Ustad Vilayat Khan stated that he has settled in Princeton , New Jersey , USA and spends one half of the time here in training westerners into classical Indian music , and the other half time in India .
Fans and media alike liked to play up Vilayat Khans rivalry with and animosity towards Ravi Shankar .
However , in calmer moments Vilayat would admit there was not much to it .
His animosity for the politics and institutions of Indias cultural life was another matter .
In 1964 and 1968 , respectively , he was awarded the Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan awards - Indias fourth and third highest civilian honours for service to the nation - but refused to accept them , declaring the committee musically incompetent to judge him .
In January 2000 , when he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan , the second highest civilian award , he again refused , going so far as to call it an insult .
This time , his criticism had a slightly different twist : he would not accept any award that other sitar players , his juniors and in his opinion less deserving , had been given before him .
If there is any award for sitar in India , I must get it first , he said , adding that there has always been a story of wrong time , wrong person and wrong award in this country .
Among other honours he turned down was the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award .
For a while , he also boycotted All-India Radio .
The only titles he accepted were the special decorations of Bharat Sitar Samrat by the Artistes Association of India and Aftab-e-Sitar from President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed .
He kept his childhood interest in vocal music all his life , often singing in concerts , and composed khyal bandishes using the pen name Nath Piya .

Merukhand is an improvisational style in Hindustani classical music involving permutations of a fixed set of swaras or notes broken up in various ways , while retaining the proper emphasis on various notes as required by the raga .
Merukhand techniques were developed within the Bhendibazar gharana and popularized by masters like Aman Ali Khan and Abdul Waheed Khan .

The sarod is a lutelike stringed instrument of India , used mainly in Indian classical music .
Along with the sitar , it is among the most popular and prominent instruments in Hindustani classical music .
The sarod is known for a deep , weighty , introspective sound , in contrast with the sweet , overtone-rich texture of the sitar , with sympathetic strings that give it a resonant , reverberant quality .
It is a fretless instrument able to produce the continuous slides between notes known as meend , which is important to Indian music .
The sarod is believed by some to have descended from the Afghan rubab , a similar instrument originating in Central Asia and Afghanistan .
The name Sarod roughly translates to beautiful sound or melody in Persian , one of the many languages spoken in Afghanistan .
Although the sarod has been referred to as a bass rubab its tonal bandwidth is actually considerably greater than that of the rubab , especially in the middle and high registers .
Lalmani Misra opines in his Bharatiya Sangeet Vadya that the sarod is an combination of the ancient chitra veena , the medieval rubab and modern sursingar .
There is also speculation that the oud may be the origin of the sarod.Jafar Khan brother of Pyar Khan and Basit Khan invented Sarod at the court of Wajid Ali Shah .
Among the many conflicting and contested histories of the sarod , there is one that attributes its invention to the ancestors of the present-day sarod maestro , Amjad Ali Khan .
Amjad Ali Khan 's ancestor Mohammad Hashmi Khan Bangash , a musician and horse trader , came to India with the Afghan rubab in the mid-18th century , and became a court musician to the Maharajah of Rewa .
It was his descendants , notably his grandson Ghulam Ali Khan Bangash , a court musician in Gwalior , who changed the rubab into the sarod we know today .
A parallel theory credits descendants of Madar Khan , Niyamatullah Khan in particular , with the same innovation around 1820 .
The sarod in its present form dates back to approximately 1820 , when it started gaining recognition as a serious instrument in Rewa , Shahjahanpur , Gwalior and Lucknow .
In the 20th century , the sarod received some finishing touches from Allauddin Khan , the performer-pedagogue from Maihar best known as sitarist Ravi Shankar s guru .
However , as is the case with most young , evolving instruments , much work remains to be done in the area of sarod luthiery in order to achieve reliable customization , and precise replication of successful instruments .
This reflects the general state of Indian instrument making today .
The design of the instrument depends on the school of playing .
There are three distinguishable types , discussed below .
The conventional sarod is a 17 to 25-stringed lute-like instrument -- four to five main strings used for playing the melody , one or two drone strings , two chikari strings and nine to eleven sympathetic strings .
The design of this early model is generally credited to Niyamatullah Khan of the Lucknow Gharana as well as Ghulam Ali Khan of the Gwalior-Bangash Gharana .
Among the contemporary sarod players , this basic design is kept intact by two streams of sarod playing .
Amjad Ali Khan and his disciples play this model , as do the followers of Radhika Mohan Maitra .
Both Amjad Ali Khan and Buddhadev Dasgupta have introduced minor changes to their respective instruments which have become the design templates for their followers .
Both musicians use sarods made of teak wood , and a soundboard made of goat skin stretched across the face of the resonator .
Buddhadev Dasgupta prefers a polished stainless steel fingerboard for the ease of maintenance while Amjad Ali Khan uses the conventional chrome or nickel-plated cast steel fingerboard .
Visually , the two variants are similar , with six pegs in the main pegbox , two rounded chikari pegs and 11 to 15 sympathetic strings .
The descendants of Niyamatullah Khan also play similar instruments .
Some of the followers of Radhika Mohan Maitra still carry the second resonator on their sarods .
Amjad Ali Khan and his followers have rejected the resonator altogether .
These instruments are typically tuned to B , which is the traditional setting .
Another more technically sophisticated and acoustically superior type is that designed by Allauddin Khan and his brother Ayet Ali Khan .
This instrument , referred to by David Trasoff as the 1934 Maihar Prototype , is larger and longer than the conventional instrument , though the fingerboard is identical to the traditional sarod described above .
This instrument has 25 strings in all .
These include four main strings , four jod strings , two chikari strings and fifteen tarab strings .
The main strings are tuned to Ma , Sa , lower Pa and lower Sa , giving the instrument a range of three octaves .
The Maihar sarod lends itself extremely well to the presentation of alap with the four jod strings providing a backdrop for the ambiance of the raga .
This variant is , however , not conducive to the performance of clean right-hand picking on individual strings .
The instrument is typically tuned to C .
The finest Sarods are made by Hemen Sen of Calcutta .
Most of the well known players such as Amjad Ali Khan , Tejendra Narayan Majumdar , Brij Narayan , Alam Khan and many others play Hemen Instruments .
Sarod strings are either made of steel or phosphor bronze .
Most contemporary sarod players use German or American-made strings , such as Roslau , Pyramid and Precision .
The strings are plucked with a triangular plectrum made of polished coconut shell , ebony , cocobolo wood , horn , cowbone , DelrinTM or other such materials .
Early sarod players used plain wire plectrums , which yield a soft , ringing tone .
The lack of frets and the tension of the strings make the sarod a very demanding instrument to play , as the strings must be pressed hard against the fingerboard .
There are two approaches to stopping the strings of the sarod .
One involves using the tip of ones fingernails to stop the strings , and the other uses a combination of the nail and the fingertip to stop the strings against the fingerboard .
Fingering techniques and how they are taught depends largely on the personal preferences of musicians rather than on the basis of school affiliation .
Radhika Mohan Maitra , for example , used the index , middle and ring finger of his left hand to stop the string , just like followers of Allauddin Khan do .
Maitra , however , made much more extensive use of the third fingernail for slides and hammers .
Amjad Ali Khan , while a member of approximately the same stylistic school as Radhika Mohan , prefers to use just the index and middle fingers of his left hand .
Amjad Ali is , however , pictured circa 1960 playing with all three fingers
was the fifth King of Oudh , holding the position from 13 February 1847 to 11 February 1856 .
He was the tenth and last Nawab of the state of Awadh in present day Uttar Pradesh in India .
He ascended the throne of Awadh in 1847 and ruled for nine years .
His kingdom , long protected by the British under treaty , was eventually annexed peacefully on 11 February 1856 - days before the ninth anniversary of his coronation .
The Nawab was exiled to Garden Reach in Metiabruz , then a suburb of Kolkata , where he lived out the rest of his life off a generous pension .
He was a poet , playwright , dancer and great patron of the arts .
He is widely credited with the revival of Kathak as a major form of classical Indian dance .
Wajid Ali Shah succeeded to the throne of Awadh when its glory days were at its peak and passing .
The British had annexed much of the kingdom under the treaty of 1801 , and had impoverished Awadh by imposing a hugely expensive , British-run army and repeated demands for loans .
The independence of Awadh in name was tolerated by the British only because they still needed a buffer state between their presence in the East and South , and the remnants of the Mughal Empire to the North .
Wajid Ali Shah was most unfortunate to have ascended the throne of Oudh at a time when the British East India Company was determined to grab the coveted throne of prosperous Awadh , which was the garden , granary , and queen-province of India , though before Britain came into full control , his predecessors and successors were one of the major threats to the Mughal Empire .
In different circumstances perhaps , he might have succeeded as a ruler because he had many qualities that make a good administrator .
He was generous , kind and compassionate towards his subjects , besides being one of the most magnanimous and passionate patrons of the Fine Arts .
When he ascended the throne , he took keen interest in the administration of justice , introduced reforms , and reorganised the military department , but gradually sank into a life of pleasures surrounded by courtesans , singers , dancers , and eunuchs .
Wajid Ali Shah was widely regarded as a debauched and detached ruler , but some of his notoriety seems to have been misplaced .
The main case for condemnation comes from the British Resident of Lucknow , General Sleeman who submitted a report highlighting maladministration and lawlessness supposed to be prevailing there .
This proved to be the trigger the British were looking for , and formed the official basis for their annexation .
Recent studies have , however , suggested that Oudh was neither as bankrupt nor as lawless as the British had claimed .
In fact , Oudh was for all practical purposes under British rule well before the annexation , with the Nawab playing little more than a titular role .
The army was composed mostly of British officers , while the purse strings were firmly under the control of the East India Company .
In his book Awadh Under Wajid Ali Shah , Dr. G.D. Bhatnagar gives the following assessment of this ill-starred prince : .
Cast by providence for the role of an accomplished dilettante , he found himself a misfit for the high office to which he was elevated by chance .
Wajid Ali Shahs character was complex .
Though he was a man of pleasure , he was neither an unscrupulous knave nor a brainless libertine .
He was a lovable and generous gentleman .
He was a voluptuary , still he never touched wine , and though sunk in pleasure , he never missed his five daily prayers .
It was the literary and artistic attainments of Wajid Ali Shah which distinguished him from his contemporaries .
A large number of composers who thrived under the lavish patronage of the Nawab rulers of Lucknow enriched the light classical form of thumri ; most prominent among these was Wajid Ali Shah .
He was not only a munificent patron of music , dance , drama , and poetry , but was himself a gifted composer .
He had received vocal training under great Ustads like Basit Khan , Pyar Khan and Jafar Khan.Pyar Khan , Jafar Khan , and Basit Khan were the direct descendants of Miyan Tansen and were the sons of Famous Tanseni Chajju Khan.Bahadur Hussain Khan/Zia-ud-Daulah was the favourite musician of Wajid Ali Shah.Bahadur Hussain Khan was the son of Famous sufi saint Jeevan Shah of Jhansi , and descendant of Tansens son-in-law Naubaat Khan.Although Wajid Ali Shahs pen-name was Qaisar , he used the pseudonym Akhtarpiya for his numerous compositions .
Under this pen name , he wrote over forty works - poems , prose and Thumris .
Diwan-i-Akhtar , Husn-i-Akhtar contain his Ghazals .
He is said to have composed many new ragas and named them Jogi , Juhi , Shah-Pasand , etc. .
Kathak dance attained new heights of popularity and glory under his expert guidance and lavish patronage .
Thakur Prasadji was his Kathak guru , and the unforgettable Kalka-Binda brothers performed in his court .
What with the grand pageantry of the Rahas , Jogiya Jashan , Dance dramas , and Kathak performances , Lucknow became the magnetic cultural centre where the most reputed musicians , dancers and poets of the time flourished .
The greatest musicians , dancers and instrumentalists of the time enjoyed his munificent patronage and hospitality .
When Wajid Ali Shah was a young boy , some astrologers warned his parents that he would become a Yogi , and advised them that the boy should be dressed up as a Yogi on each birthday of his so as to counteract the effect of the evil stars .
He established his famous Parikhaana in which hundreds of beautiful and talented girls were taught music and dancing by expert-teachers engaged by the royal patron .
These girls were known as Paris with names such as Sultan pari , Mahrukh pari and so on .
On each birthday , the Nawab would dress up as a Yogi with saffron robes , ash of pearls smeared on his face and body , necklaces of pearls around his neck , and a rosary in his hand , and walk pompously into the court with two of his paris dressed up as Jogans .
Gradually he made it into a spectacular pageant or Mela known as Jogia Jashan , in which all citizens of Lucknow could participate , dressed as Yogis , irrespective of caste and creed .
Later on , when his favourite venue , the Qaisarbagh Baradari was built , he began to stage his magnificent Rahas full of sensuous poetry , his own lyrical compositions and glamorous Kathak dances .
Ranbir Singh gives details of Wajid Ali Shahs book entitled Bani in which the author mentions 36 types of Rahas all set in Kathak style , and gives exhaustive notes about the costumes , jewellery , and stage - craft .
Rahas , prepared at a fabulous cost of several lakhs of rupees , became very popular , and was performed at the Kaisarbagh-Rahas Manzil , .
Many have regarded Wajid Ali Shah as the first playwright of the Hindustani theatre , because his Radha Kanhaiyya Ka Qissa staged in the Rahas Manzil was the first play of its kind .
It featured Radha , Krishna , several sakhis , and a vidushaka-like character called Ramchera .
Songs , dances , mime , and drama were all delightfully synthesised in these Rahas performances .
He dramatised many other poems such as Darya-i-Tashsq , Afsane-i-Isbaq , and Bhahar-i-Ulfat .
It is said that Amanats Inder Sabha was inspired by these dance-dramas , written , produced and staged by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah .
In his exile in Metiabruz , he tried to keep the sweet memories of his Lucknow era alive by recreating the musical environments of his Kaisarbagh Baradari .
The banished king had been given a number of fine houses with vast grounds stretching along the banks of the River Hooghly 3 or 4 miles south of Kolkata .
Because of an Earthen Dome , people called it Matiya Burj .
The king spent lavishly out of his income of 12 lakh rupees per annum and before long a second Lucknow arose in this area .
His Bhairavi thumri Babul Mora Naihar Chhooto Jaay has been sung by several prominent singers , but the version most remembered is by Kundan Lal Saigal for the 1930s movie Street Singer .
In a strange manner this sad song epitomises the pain and agony of the poet king himself when he was exiled from his beloved Lucknow
Swami Harballabh was an Hindustani classical vocalist and a saint .
He established the first Hindustani classical music festival in the world in 1875 known as Harballabh Sangeet Sammelan .
He was born in an affluent family at a village in Bajwara .
He was a student of Swami Tulja Gir , who encouraged him to practice art and music .
The place where Swami Hariballabh used to sing became a Mecca for the best Musicians and players of Classical Music

Pandit Jasraj is an Indian classical vocalist .
He belongs to the Mewati gharana of Hindustani classical music .
Jasraj was born in Hisar , Mewat region , Haryana in an orthodox Brahmin family to Motiram , a classical singer .
His family performed the Mewati gharana style .
Motiram died when Jasraj was four , on the day he was to be appointed as the state musician in the court of Osman Ali Khan .
Jasraj was initiated into vocal music by his father .
He received training from his elder brother , Maniram , and later from Maharaja Jaywant Singh Waghela and Ustad Gulam Kadar Khan of Mewat Gharana .
In addition , he trained under Swami Vallabhdas of the Agra Gharana .
In 1960 , when Jasraj went to visit Bade Ghulam Ali Khan in hospital , Khan asked him to become his disciple , but Jasraj declined saying that he could not accept Khans tutelage since he was already Manirams disciple .
As a means of livelihood , Maniram took Jasraj as an accompanying tabla player .
However , at the time , like sarangi players , tabla players were considered minor artists .
At the age of 14 , unhappy with his treatment as an accompanying artist , Jasraj left and vowed not to cut his hair until he learned to sing .
He finally cut his hair after garnering his first AIR Radio performance , where he sang Raga Kaunsi Kanada .
Jasrajs vocal range extends three-and-a-half octaves and uses precise diction , a trademark of the Mewati gharana s style of khayal .
He has also done extensive research in Haveli Sangeet under Baba Shyam Manohar Goswami Maharaj to create numerous innovative bandish .
Jasraj created a novel form of jugalbandi called Jasrangi that is styled on the ancient system of moorchhana , between a male and a female vocalist , who each sing different ragas at the same time .
He is also known for presenting a wide variety of Rare Raags including Gyankali , Abiri Todi , Dhanashree , Patdeepki , Purba , Bhavsakh , Devsakh , Gunji Kanada and Charju Ki Malhar .
Jasraj has many students , including Rattan Mohan Sharma , Sanjeev Abhyankar , Ramesh Narayan , Suman Ghosh , Tripti Mukherjee , Pritam Bhattacharjee , Kala Ramnath and Sadhana Sargam .
In memory of his father , Jasraj organises a musical festival every year called the Pandit Motiram Pandit Maniram Sangeet Samaroh in Hyderabad , India .
It ran for 36 years as of 2008 .
Jasraj participated at the Sawai Gandharva Music Festival .
In 1962 , Jasraj married Madhura , the daughter of film director V. Shantaram , who he had first met in 1955 during the filming of Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje .
After their marriage the couple lived in Kolkata for some time .
They have a son , Shaarangdev Pandit , and a daughter , Durga Jasraj , a television anchor and presenter .
Madhura has directed documentaries and childrens plays , and directed and produced ballets , Geeta-Govinda , Kaan Kahaani and Surdas , and the TV series , Faster Phene.Madhura made a film , Sangeet Martand Pandit Jasraj in 2009 and directed her first Marathi film , Aai Tuzha Aashirwad , in 2010 , in which her husband and Lata Mangeshkar sang in Marathi .
Music composers Jatin-Lalit are Jasrajs nephews , and Sulakshana Pandit is his niece
Qureshi Alla Rakha Khan popularly known as Alla Rakha was an Indian tabla player .
He was a frequent accompanist of Ravi Shankar .
Alla Rakha was born in Paghwal , Jammu , British India .
His mother tongue was Dogri .
He became fascinated with the sound and rhythm of the tabla at the age of 12 , while staying with his uncle in Gurdaspur .
Finding little chances for grooming and appreciation , the determined young lad ran away from home , became a disciple of and began studying tabla with Mian Kader Baksh of the Punjab gharana .
He studied voice and Raag Vidya under Ashiq Ali Khan of the Patiala gharana .
His regimen of practice and dedication were legendary : hours upon hours of hard , disciplined practice , that would later pay off .
He was married to Bavi Begum , and had three sons , Zakir Hussain , Fazal Qureshi and Taufiq Qureshi , a daughter Khurshid Aulia nee Qureshi , and nine grandchildren .
Alla Rakha had another daughter , Razia , whose death preceded his by less than 24 hours .
He also married to a lady belonging to Faisalabad , Pakistan .
It was a love marriage .
Rohi Bano , a popular TV actress in 1980s , was his daughter from this wedlock .
She is still alive .
He had another brother called Sabir who practised tabla in Lahore .
Alla Rakha began his career as an accompanist in Lahore and then as an All India Radio staffer in Bombay in 1940 , playing the stations first ever tabla solo and elevating the instruments position in the process .
Soon after , he composed music for a couple of Hindi films from 1943-48 .
However , he still played as an accompanist , for soloists like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , Allauddin Khan , Vilayat Khan , Vasant Rai , Ali Akbar Khan and most notably , Ravi Shankar .
The venerable master achieved world renown as Ravi Shankars chief accompanist during his apex in the 1960s , delighting audiences in the West with his percussive wizardry , not only as an uncanny accompanist with flawless timing and sensitivity but also as a soloist where he was a master of improvisation , a prolific composer and an electric showman .
The partnership was particularly successful , and his legendary and spellbinding performances with Shankar at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967 and the Woodstock Festival in 1969 served to introduce classical Indian music to general Western audiences .
He became a Guru to Sankha Chatterjee , Yogesh Samsi , Prafulla Athalye , Aditya Kalyanpur , Anuradha Pal , Nishikant Barodekar , Uday Ramdas , Shyam Kane , and his sons Taufiq Qureshi and Fazal Qureshi .
His eldest son , Zakir Hussain is also an accomplished tabla virtuoso .
Ustad Alla Rakha Khan popularised the art of tabla , playing across the globe , elevating the status and respect of his instrument .
Abbaji also bridged the gap between Carnatic music and Hindustani music by playing with both renowned Carnatic musicians and other Hindustani stalwarts .
Leading American percussionists in Rock n Roll , such as the Grateful Dead s Mickey Hart , admired him and studied his technique , benefiting greatly even from single meetings .
Hart , a published authority on percussion in world music , said Alla Rakha is the Einstein , the Picasso ; he is the highest form of rhythmic development on this planet .
Alla Rakha also collaborated with jazz drummer Buddy Rich , on their 1968 album Rich a la Rakha .
Ustad Alla Rakha Khan was awarded the Padma Shri in 1977 and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1982 .
Alla Rakha died on 3 February 2000 at his Simla House residence on Nepean Sea Road following a heart attack , which he suffered on learning of the death of his daughter , Razia , the previous evening
Lalmani Misra , M.A. , Ph.D. , D. Mus .
, M.Mus .
, B.Mus .
, Dean & Head , Faculty of Music and Fine Arts , Banaras Hindu University , Varanasi , was an eminent Indian classical musician known as much for his art as for his scholarship .
Lalmani learnt Dhruvapada Dhamar in the tradition of Pt .
Shankar Bhatt and Munshi Bhrigunath Lal .
He learnt Khayal singing with Ustad Mehndi Hussain Khan , a disciple of Ustad Vazir Khan of Rampur Seni Gharana .
He received training in Dhruvpad , Bhajan and Tabla from Swami Pramodanand ; in sitar from Shri Shukdev Roy .
Under the tutelage of Ustad Amir Ali Khan he perfected several other musical instruments .
Lalmani was appointed on the post of assistant music director in Shehanshahi Recording Company , Calcutta at the age of twelve .
He worked in several films for the next two years .
His interaction with these two , kindled an interest for orchestration in Lalmani .
He returned to Kanpur in 1940 after his father 's death .
A musical prodigy himself , he experimented with ways of imparting musical training to children , at a time and place where learning of music was shunned by the chaste and noble .
He opened several `` Bal Sangeet Vidyalaya '' - music schools for children ; modified the syllabus according to the need of learner , both formal and informal ; started an orchestra society .
He established the reputed institution of the region , `` Bharatiya Sangeet Parishad '' , and a music college - `` Gandhi Sangeet Mahavidyalaya '' .
Excited by all things musical he persisted in experimenting and soon his innovations in technique , style , and orchestration brought him repute and regard .
The renowned dance maestro Pt .
Uday Shankar offered him the position of music director in his troupe .
Lalmani Misra traveled with the troupe composing scores for the innovative dance presentations and ballets on mythological and contemporary themes .
The troupe covered several major towns and cities of India and covered Ceylone , France , England , Belgium , America and Canada between 1951 and 1955 .
Not only was he adept at playing several types of musical instruments , he also had a knack for orchestration that served the needs of an innovative Dance troupe .
The experience with the troupe made him try his hand on stage as well .
He created Meera opera that was staged in 1956 at Kanpur .
The audience were amazed by sudden disappearance of Meera from stage , apparently merging into the idol of Lord Krishna .
On his return Lalmani Misra was appointed as the Registrar of `` Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mandal Mahavidyalaya , Bombay '' - the prestigious most body for Indian Classical Music education .
On the pressing invitation of citizens and city officials , he resigned to join the college he had founded in his hometown Kanpur , as its Principal in 1956 .
Meanwhile , the College of Music and Fine Arts had been established by Pandit Omkarnath Thakur at Banaras Hindu University , Varanasi in 1950 .
By 1955-56 its teething troubles were over and department was ready for expansion .
A scheme for its re-organization was prepared with inspiration and encouragement provided by the then Vice Chancellor , Dr. Sir C.P. Ramaswami Iyer .
On the insistence of Pandit Omkarnath Thakur , Lalmani Misra accepted appointment as Reader in the college and left his native Kanpur a third time for Varanasi in 1957 .
Dr. Lalmani Misra followed stalwart predecessors like Omkarnath Thakur and Dr. B. R. Deodhar in the Department of Performing Arts at BHU .
Under his able helmsman-ship , the college increased its reputation in imparting the best education in Hindustani classical music .
A rigorous hands-on course in performance and composition culminating in doctoral degree was started which has earned faculty positions for almost all its graduates around the globe .
He was visiting Professor to Music faculty at Penn University , Philadelphia from 1969 to 1978 .
Many students came to learn intricacies of music with him .
Pandit Uday Shankar sent his son Ananda Shankar to Dr. Misra to learn the art of orchestration .
Multi-faceted Dr. Misra , apart from secretly perfecting the technique of Vichitra Veena after having heard a performance by Abdul Aziz Khan of Patiala , had carried out research on history and development of Indian musical instruments .
His thesis published by Bharatiya Jnanpith , New Delhi in 1973 under the title Bharatiya Sangeet Vadya dispelled the existing myths about the origin of Indian instruments and serves to this day as the primary reference work for identification , authentication and classification of Indian musical instruments .
He wrote several other books .

Carrying out research in the music of Vedic age , he unraveled the mystery of Samic scale .
To re-establish the lost notes of that period he created a Raga Sameshwari .
Dr. Misra also first made it possible in history of mankind , the twenty two Shruti-s to be distinctly heard on a single Veena .
The invention and key to its function has been explained in `` Shruti Veena '' published on 11-02-1964 by Vikram Singh , Narendra Printing Works , Varanasi .

Unesco released a compact disc of his Vichitra Veena entitled The Music of Pandit Lalmani Misra in 1996 .
True inventions are seldom noticeable .
Early on , Dr. Misra found use of Teen Tal in slow and medium compositions ubiquitous .
He realized that it was the possibility of Chhand-s that made this Tal a favorite of most instrumentalists .
He experimented and created equally alluring Chhand-s in other Tal-s .
Legendary percussionists were enamored by his compositions because of their complex , oblique rhythm pattern and called it Koot ki Taan .

As a young girl , Sharan Rani learned to play the sarod from the master musicians Allauddin Khan and his son Ali Akbar Khan .
During this period in Indian history , a career as a musician was seen as something for gharanas or was the profession of nautch girls or baijis , not something appropriate for the daughter of a respectable , non-musician family .

In 1953 , she did her M.A from Delhi University , and studied at Indraprastha College for Women .

Rag Shankara , Rag Mala in Jogia is a studio album by Indian classical musician Ram Narayan , released in 1990 .
Recorded on 15 and 16 November 1989 in Wyastone Leys near Monmouth , Wales , the album features a sarangi performance of the solemn night raga Shankara and a raga mala based on the introspective early morning raga Jogiya .
On both tracks , Narayan performs a long non-metrical introduction to unfold the raga , during which he adds a pulse , until he is joined by the tabla player to perform a composition .
The album consists of performances of the ragas Shankara and Jogiya ; Jogiya is performed in raga mala form .
Shankara is considered a solemn and dignified raga that is difficult to master .
It has been described by Vamanrao Deshpande as representing the heroic mood .
Luiz Martinez Jose argued that the raga was named for a gentle and guarding incarnation of the Hindu deity Shiva .
Shankara is performed in the late night and distinguished by an emphasis on the third and seventh notes , the upper tetrachord , and several characteristic phrases and slow glides in descend .
It has similarities to the South Indian raga Hansadhvani .
Jogiya is considered an introspective raga named for the yogi practice , and is often performed in devotional music and the light classical genre thumri .
Peter Manuel described it as the most important raga of the Bhairav that .
Jogiya is performed at daybreak and emphasizes the tonic and the fifth .
It has several characteristic phrases and , like Shankara , is suited for the upper tetrachord .
Joep Bor argued that the raga appears to be related to raga Asavari .
Jogiya is one of Narayans favorite ragas .
A raga mala allows for the introduction of other ragas , which can be from any time of the day .
The change from Jogiya into another raga and back must be smooth as there is no break in the music , making a raga mala difficult to perform .
Rag Shankara , Rag Mala in Jogia was recorded on 15 and 16 November 1989 in Wyastone Leys near Monmouth , Wales .
Narayan begins the performances by playing a long alap and jor .
The tabla player then joins Narayan in performing a composition , repeating the rhythmic cycle on which the composition is based and playing occasional improvisations .
The album cover features a painting made ca. 1760 in Murshidabad in the provincial Mughal style of Bengal .
It depicts a young woman sitting next to a lake , playing on a rudra veena to a parakeet , which symbolizes her absent lover .
A picture of Narayan with his sarangi , taken by Joseph Stieger , is on the back of the album .

The sarangi is a bowed , short-necked string instrument from South Asia which is used in Hindustani classical music .
It is said to most resemble the sound of the human voice - able to imitate vocal ornaments such as gamaks and meends .
There are different versions for the meaning and origins of sarangi The word sarangi could be a combination of two sanskrit words : saar and ang hence meaning the instrument that can summarize every style of music or playing .
According to some musicians , the word Sarangi is a combination of two words ` seh ' and ` rangi ' corrupted as Sarangi .
The term seh-rangi represents the three melody strings .
Sarangi is widely believed to mean `` a hundred colours '' indicating its adaptability to a wide range of musical styles , its flexible tunability , and its ability to produce a large palette of tonal colour and emotional nuance .
Sarangi now enjoys the status of a solo classical instrument due to the single-handed efforts of Ram Narayan .
There is a variation to the fingering technique that was used by Ram Narayan .
It differs from the standard fingering as to when one shifts from the first finger to the second finger .
Well known sarangi players include Mamman Khan , Nathu Khan , Shakoor Khan , Sagiruddin Khan , Hanuman Prasad Mishra , Abdul Lateef Khan , Bundu Khan , Majid Khan , Basheer Khan , Mahmood Khan , Sabri Khan and Sultan Khan .
The repertoire of sarangi players is traditionally very closely related to vocal music .
Nevertheless , a concert with a solo sarangi as the main item will probably include a full-scale raag presentation with an extensive alap in increasing intensity and several compositions in increasing tempi called bandish .
As such , it is on a par with other instrumental styles such as for sitar , sarod , and bansuri .
Sarangi music is often vocal music .
It is rare to find a sarangi player who does not know the words of many classical compositions .
The words are usually mentally present during performance , and performance almost always adheres to the conventions of vocal performance including the organisational structure , the types of elaboration , the tempo , the relationship between sound and silence , and the presentation of khyal and thumri compositions .
The vocal quality of sarangi is in a quite separate category from , for instance , the so-called gayaki-ang of sitar which attempts to imitate the nuances of khyal while overall conforming to the structures and usually keeping to the gat compositions of instrumental music .
The sarangi is also a traditional stringed musical instrument of Nepal , commonly played by the Gaine or Gandarbha ethnic group but the form and repertoire of sarangi is more towards the folk music as compared to the heavy and classical form of repertoire in India .
Carved from a single block of tun wood , the sarangi has a box-like shape with three hollow chambers : pet , chaati and magaj .
It is usually around long and around wide though it can vary as there are smaller as well as larger variant sarangis as well .
The lower resonance chamber or pet is covered with parchment made out of goat skin on which a strip of thick leather is placed around the waist which supports the elephant-shaped bridge that is made of camel or buffalo bone usually .
The bridge in turn supports the huge pressure of approximately 35-37 sympathetic steel or brass strings and three main gut strings that pass through it .
The three main playing strings - the comparatively thicker gut strings - are bowed with a heavy horsehair bow and stopped not with the finger-tips but with the nails , cuticles and surrounding flesh .

The neck has ivory/bone platforms on which the fingers slide .
The remaining strings are resonance strings or tarabs , numbering up to around 35-37 , divided into 4 choirs having two sets of pegs , one on the right and one on the top .
On the inside is a chromatically tuned row of 15 tarabs and on the right a diatonic row of 9 tarabs each encompassing a full octave plus 1-3 extra notes above or below that .
Both these sets of tarabs pass from the main bridge to the right side set of pegs through small holes in the chaati supported by hollow ivory/bone beads .
Between these inner tarabs and on the either side of the main playing strings lie two more sets of longer tarabs , with 5-6 strings on the right set and 6-7 strings on the left set .
They pass from the main bridge over to two small , flat and wide table like bridges through the additional bridge towards the second peg set on top of the instrument .
These are tuned to the important tones of the raga .
A properly tuned sarangi will hum and cry and will sound like melodious meowing , with tones played on any of the main strings eliciting echo-like resonances .
A few sarangis use strings manufactured from the intestines of goats -- these harken back to the days when rich musicians could afford such strings .

Lewis Brian Hopkins Jones was the founder and original bandleader of the Rolling Stones .
Jones was a multi-instrumentalist , with his main instruments being the guitar , the harmonica and the keyboards .
His innovative use of traditional or folk instruments , such as the sitar and marimba , was integral to the changing sound of the band .
Although he was originally the leader of the group , Joness fellow band members Mick Jagger and Keith Richards soon overshadowed him , especially after they became a successful songwriting team .
He developed a serious drug problem over the years and his role in the band steadily diminished .
He was asked to leave the Rolling Stones in June 1969 and guitarist Mick Taylor took his place in the group .
Jones died less than a month later by drowning in the swimming pool at his home on Cotchford Farm in Hartfield , East Sussex .
Original Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman said of Jones , He formed the band .
He chose the members .
He named the band .
He chose the music we played .
He got us gigs .
... Very influential , very important , and then slowly lost it -- highly intelligent -- and just kind of wasted it and blew it all away .
Jones was born in the Park Nursing Home in Cheltenham , Gloucestershire , on 28 February 1942 .
An attack of croup at the age of four left him with asthma , which lasted for the rest of his life .
His middle-class parents , Lewis Blount Jones and Louisa Beatrice Jones were of Welsh descent .
Brian had two sisters : Pamela , who was born on 3 October 1943 and who died on 14 October 1945 of leukaemia ; and Barbara , born on 22 August 1946 .
Both Joness parents were interested in music : his mother Louisa was a piano teacher , and in addition to his job as an aeronautical engineer , Lewis Jones played piano and organ and led the choir at the local church .
In 1957 Jones first heard Cannonball Adderley s music , which inspired his interest in jazz .
Jones persuaded his parents to buy him a saxophone , and two years later his parents gave him his first acoustic guitar as a 17th birthday present .
Jones attended local schools , including Dean Close School , from September 1949 to July 1953 and Cheltenham Grammar School for Boys , which he entered in September 1953 after passing the Eleven-plus exam .
He enjoyed badminton and diving at school and attained first clarinet in the school orchestra .
In 1957 he reportedly obtained seven O-level passes , then he continued into the sixth form and obtained a further two O-levels .
He also took three A-levels in Physics , Chemistry and Biology and passed in Physics and Chemistry , but failed in Biology .
Jones had an IQ of 135 and was able to perform well in exams despite a lack of academic effort .
However , he found school regimented and disliked conforming .
He disliked the school uniforms and angered teachers with his behaviour , though he was popular with classmates .
Jones himself said : When I made the sixth form I found myself accepted by the older boys ; suddenly I was in .
His hostility to authority figures resulted in his suspension from school on two occasions .
According to Dick Hattrell , a childhood friend : He was a rebel without a cause , but when examinations came he was brilliant .
In late summer 1959 , Joness 17-year-old girlfriend , a Cheltenham schoolgirl named Valerie Corbett , became pregnant .
Although Jones is said to have encouraged her to have an abortion , she carried the child to term and placed baby Barry David for adoption .
Jones quit school in disgrace and left home , travelling for a summer through Northern Europe and Scandinavia .
During this period , he lived a bohemian lifestyle , busking with his guitar on the streets for money , and living off the charity of others .
Eventually , he ran short of money and returned to England .
Jones listened to classical music as a child , but preferred blues , particularly Elmore James and Robert Johnson .
He began performing at local blues and jazz clubs , while busking and working odd jobs .
He reportedly stole small amounts of money from work to pay for cigarettes , for which he was fired .
In November 1959 , Jones went to the Wooden Bridge Hotel in Guildford to see a band perform .
He met a young married woman named Angeline , and the two had a one-night stand that resulted in her pregnancy .
Angeline and her husband decided to raise the baby , a girl , born on 4 August the following year .
Jones never knew about her birth .
In 1961 , Jones applied for a scholarship to Cheltenham Art College .
He was initially accepted into the programme , but two days later the offer was withdrawn after an unidentified acquaintance wrote to the college , calling Jones an irresponsible drifter .
On 23 October 1961 , Joness girlfriend Pat Andrews gave birth to his third child , Julian Mark Andrews .
Jones sold his record collection to buy flowers for Pat and clothes for the newborn .
He lived with them for a while .
On 23 July 1964 , another woman , Linda Lawrence , gave birth to Joness fourth child , named Julian Brian .
In early October 1964 , an occasional girlfriend of Brians , Dawn Molloy , announced to Brian and the bands management that she was pregnant by Brian .
She received a cheque for PS700 from Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. .
In return , she signed an agreement that the matter was now closed and she would make no statement about Brian Jones or the child to the public or the press .
The undated statement was signed by Malloy and witnessed by Mick .
Jones left Cheltenham and moved to London where he became friends with fellow musicians Alexis Korner , future Manfred Mann singer Paul Jones , future Cream bassist Jack Bruce and others who made up the small London rhythm and blues and jazz scene there .
He became a blues musician , for a brief time calling himself Elmo Lewis , and playing slide guitar .
Jones also started a group with Paul Jones called the Roosters and in January 1963 , after both Brian and Paul left the group , Eric Clapton took over Brians position as guitarist .
Jones placed an advertisement in Jazz News of 2 May 1962 inviting musicians to audition for a new R&B ; group at the Bricklayers Arms pub ; pianist Ian Stu Stewart was the first to respond .
Later singer Mick Jagger also joined this band ; Jagger and his childhood friend Keith Richards had met Jones when he and Paul Jones were playing Elmore James Dust My Broom with Korners band at the Ealing Jazz Club .
Jagger brought guitarist Richards to rehearsals ; Richards then joined the band .
Joness and Stewarts acceptance of Richards and the Chuck Berry songs he wanted to play coincided with the departure of blues purists Geoff Bradford and Brian Knight , who had no tolerance for Chuck Berry .
As Keith Richards tells it , Jones came up with the name the Rollin Stones while on the phone with a venue owner .
The voice on the other end of the line obviously said , What are you called ?
Panic .
The Best of Muddy Waters album was lying on the floor -- and track five , side one was Rollin ` Stone .
The Rollin Stones played their first gig on 12 July 1962 in the Marquee Club in London with Jagger , Richards , Jones , Stewart , bass player Dick Taylor and drummer Tony Chapman .
From September 1962 to September 1963 Jones , Jagger and Richards shared a flat at 102 Edith Grove , Chelsea , with James Phelge , a future photographer whose name was used in some of the groups early Nanker/Phelge writing credits .
Jones and Richards spent day after day playing guitar while listening to blues records .
During this time , Jones also taught Jagger how to play harmonica .
The four Rollin Stones went searching for a bassist and drummer , finally settling on Bill Wyman on bass because he had a spare VOX AC30 guitar amplifier and always had cigarettes , as well as a bass guitar that he had built himself .
After playing with Mick Avory , Tony Chapman and Carlo Little , in January 1963 they finally persuaded jazz-influenced Charlie Watts to join them .
At the time , Watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in London ; he had played with Alexis Korners group Blues Incorporated .
Watts described Joness role in these early days : Brian was very instrumental in pushing the band at the beginning .
Keith and I would look at him and say he was barmy .
It was a crusade to him to get us on the stage in a club and be paid half-a-crown and to be billed as an R&B ; band .
The group played at local blues and jazz clubs , garnering fans in spite of resistance from traditional jazz musicians who felt threatened by their popularity .
While Jagger was lead singer , Jones , in the groups embryonic period , was the leader -- promoting the band , landing gigs , and negotiating with venue owners .
Jones played guitar and harmonica , and during performances , especially at the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond , he proved to be a more lively and engaging performer than even Jagger .
While acting as the bands business manager , Jones received PS5 more than the other members , which did not sit well with the rest of the band and created resentment .
Keith Richards has said that both he and Mick were surprised to learn that Brian considered himself the leader and was receiving the extra PS5 , especially as other people , like Giorgio Gomelsky , appeared to be doing the booking .
Joness main guitar in the early years was a Harmony Stratotone , which he replaced with a Gretsch Double Anniversary in two-tone green .
In 1964 and 1965 he often used a teardrop-shaped prototype Vox Mark III .
From late 1965 until his death , Jones used Gibson models , as well as two Rickenbacker 12-string models .
He can also be seen playing a Fender Telecaster in the 1968 Jumpin Jack Flash promo video .
Examples of Joness contributions are his slide guitar on I Wan na Be Your Man , Im a King Bee , Little Red Rooster , I Cant Be Satisfied , Im Movin On , Doncha Bother Me and No Expectations .
Jones can also be heard playing Bo Diddley-style rhythm guitar on I Need You Baby , the guitar riff in The Last Time ; sitar on Street Fighting Man , Paint It , Black ; organ on Lets Spend the Night Together ; marimba on Under My Thumb , Out Of Time and Yesterdays Papers ; recorder on Ruby Tuesday and All Sold Out ; saxophone on Child of the Moon and Citadel ; Appalachian dulcimer on I Am Waiting and Lady Jane , and harpsichord on Lady Jane ; mellotron on Shes a Rainbow , We Love You , Stray Cat Blues , 2000 Light Years from Home , and Citadel ; and the autoharp on You Got the Silver .
Jones also played harmonica on many of the Rolling Stones early songs .
Examples of Joness playing are on Stoned , Not Fade Away , I Just Want to Make Love to You , Now Ive Got A Witness , Good Times , Bad Times , 2120 South Michigan Avenue , The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man , One More Try , High and Dry and Goin Home , Whos Driving Your Plane ?
, Cool Calm and Collected , Whos Been Sleeping Here , and Dear Doctor and Prodigal Son .
In the early years , Jones often served as a backing vocalist .
Notable examples are Come On , I Wan na Be Your Man , I Just Wan na Make Love to You , Walking the Dog , Money , Im Alright , You Better Move On and Its All Over Now .
He contributed backing vocals as late as 1968 on Sympathy For The Devil .
He is also responsible for the whistling on Walking the Dog .
Richards maintains that what he calls guitar weaving emerged from this period , from listening to Jimmy Reed albums : We listened to the teamwork , trying to work out what was going on in those records ; how you could play together with two guitars and make it sound like four or five .
Joness and Richardss guitars became a signature of the sound of the Rolling Stones , with both guitarists playing rhythm and lead without clear boundaries between the two roles .
From 1966 onwards Joness contributions in the recording studio were more as a multi-instrumentalist than as a guitarist .
His aptitude for playing a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums Aftermath , Between the Buttons and Their Satanic Majesties Request .
Andrew Loog Oldham s arrival marked the beginning of Joness slow estrangement , his prominent role gradually diminishing as the Stones centre shifted from Jones to Jagger and Richards .
Oldham recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers writing their own songs , as exemplified by Lennon-McCartney , and that playing covers would not sustain a band in the limelight for long .
Further , Oldham wanted to make Jaggers charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances .
Jones saw his influence over the Stones direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers that he preferred ; more Jagger/Richards originals developed , and Oldham increased his own managerial control , displacing Jones from yet another role .
According to Oldham in his book Stoned , Jones was an outsider from the beginning .
When the first tours were arranged in 1963 , he travelled separately from the band , stayed at different hotels , and demanded extra pay .
According to Oldham , Jones was very emotional and felt alienated because he was not a prolific song writer and his management role had been taken away .
He resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle , and so life was becoming more desperate for him day by day .
None of us were looking forward to Brian totally cracking up .
The toll from days on the road , the money and fame , and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in Joness overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs .
He frequently used LSD , pills , and cannabis , and he drank heavily .
These excesses had a debilitative effect on his physical health and , according to Oldham , Jones became unfriendly and asocial at times .
His health problems caused him to be hospitalised on a number of occasions .
Jones was arrested for drug possession on 10 May 1967 , shortly after the Redlands incident at Richards Sussex home .
Authorities found marijuana , cocaine , and methamphetamine in his flat .
He confessed to marijuana use but claimed he did not use hard drugs .
Reacting as fans did at the arrests of Joness band mates , protesters appeared outside court demanding that Jones be freed .
He was not kept in jail but was fined , given probation , and ordered to see a counselor .
In June 1967 , Jones attended the Monterey Pop Festival with singer Nico , with whom he had a brief relationship .
There he met Frank Zappa and Dennis Hopper , and went on stage to introduce the Jimi Hendrix Experience which was not well known yet in the USA .
One review referred to Jones as the unofficial king of the festival .
Hostility grew between Jones , Jagger , and Richards , alienating Jones further from the group .
Although many noted that Jones could be friendly and outgoing , Wyman , Richards , and Watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult .
By most accounts , Joness attitude changed frequently ; he was one minute caring and generous , the next making an effort to anger everyone .
As Wyman observed in Stone Alone : There were two Brians ... one was introverted , shy , sensitive , deep-thinking ... the other was a preening peacock , gregarious , artistic , desperately needing assurance from his peers ... he pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond .
In March 1967 , Anita Pallenberg , Joness girlfriend of two years , left him for Richards when Jones was hospitalised during a trip the three made to Morocco , further damaging the already strained relations between Jones and Richards .
As tensions and Joness substance use increased , his musical contributions became sporadic .
He became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play , and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions .
In Peter Whiteheads promotional film for We Love You , made in July 1967 , he appears groggy .
Joness last substantial sessions with the Stones occurred in spring and summer of 1968 when the Stones produced Jumpin Jack Flash and the Beggars Banquet album .
He can be seen in the Jean-Luc Godard film One Plus One playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with Richards , although Jones is neglected in the music-making .
The film chronicles the making of Sympathy for the Devil .
Joness acoustic guitar can be heard occasionally in the film through the microphones of the film crew but was not included in the released version .
It was clear Jones was not long for the group .
Where once he played multiple instruments on many tracks , now he played only minor roles on a few pieces .
Joness last formal appearance was in the December 1968 The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus , a part concert , part circus-act film organised by the band .
It went unreleased for 25 years because Jagger was unhappy with the bands performance compared to others in the film such as Jethro Tull , The Who , and Taj Mahal .
In the DVD release of the film Joness playing is inaudible except during Jumpin Jack Flash , Sympathy For The Devil , and No Expectations .
Commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that the end of Joness time with the Rolling Stones was near , and Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend of The Who thought it would be Joness last live musical performance .
Jones was arrested a second time on 21 May 1968 , for possession of cannabis , which Jones said had been left by previous tenants of the flat .
He was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty owing to his probation .
Wyman commented , The fact that the police had secured a warrant with no evidence showed the arrest was part of a carefully orchestrated plan .
Brian and the Stones were being targeted in an effort to deter the public from taking drugs .
The jury found him guilty but the judge had sympathy for Jones ; instead of jailing him he fined him PS50 plus PS105 in costs and told him : For goodness sake , dont get into trouble again or it really will be serious .
Joness legal troubles , estrangement from his bandmates , substance abuse and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to active participation in the band .
The Rolling Stones wanted to tour the United States in 1969 for the first time in three years but Jones was not in fit condition to tour and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a US work visa .
In addition , Joness attendance of rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic ; and when he did appear he rarely contributed anything musically or his bandmates would switch off his guitar leaving Richards playing nearly all the guitars .
According to Gary Herman , Jones was literally incapable of making music ; when he tried to play harmonica his mouth started bleeding .
This behaviour was problematic during the Beggars Banquet sessions and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording Let It Bleed .
In March 1969 , Jones borrowed the groups Jaguar and went shopping in Pimlico Road .
After the parked car was towed by police Jones hired a chauffeur car to get home .
In May 1969 , Jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to a hospital under an assumed name .
From this point , Jones was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the bands music .
By May , he had made two contributions to the work in progress : autoharp on You Got the Silver and percussion on Midnight Rambler .
Brian Joness last photo session as a Rolling Stone took place on Wednesday , 21 May 1969 , first at St. Katherine Dock s , Tower Bridge , London and then at Ethan Russells photographic studio in South Kensington , London .
The photos would appear on the album Through The Past Darkly in September 1969 .
The Stones decided that following the release of the Let it Bleed album they would start a North American tour in November 1969 .
However , the Stones management was informed that because of his drug convictions Jones would not receive a work permit .
At the suggestion of pianist and road manager Ian Stewart the Stones decided to add a new guitarist and on 8 June 1969 , Jones was visited by Mick Jagger , Keith Richards , and Charlie Watts where he was told that the group he had formed would continue without him .
To the public it appeared as if Jones had left voluntarily ; the other band members told him that although he was being asked to leave it was his choice how to break it to the public .
Jones released a statement on 9 June 1969 , announcing his departure .
In this statement he said , among other things , that I no longer see eye-to-eye with the others over the discs we are cutting .
Jones was replaced by 20-year-old guitarist Mick Taylor .
During the period of his decreasing involvement in the band Jones was living at Cotchford Farm in East Sussex , the residence formerly owned by Winnie-the-Pooh author A. A. Milne which Jones had purchased in November 1968 .
There is uncertainty as to the mental and physical state Jones was in .
The last known photographs of Jones taken by schoolgirl Helen Spittal on 23 June 1969 , shortly after his departure from the Stones are not flattering ; he appears bloated with deep-set eyes .
However , Alexis Korner , who visited in late June only shortly after the Spittal photos were taken , noted that Jones seemed happier than he had ever been .
He is known to have contacted Korner , Ian Stewart , John Lennon , Mitch Mitchell , and Jimmy Miller about intentions to put together another band .
Jones had apparently demoed a few of his own songs in the weeks before his death , including Has Anybody Seen My Baby ?
and Chow Time .
At around midnight on the night of 2-3 July 1969 , Jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at Cotchford Farm .
His Swedish girlfriend , Anna Wohlin , was convinced Jones was alive when he was taken out of the pool insisting he still had a pulse .
However , by the time the doctors arrived it was too late and he was pronounced dead .
The coroners report stated death by misadventure and noted his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by drug and alcohol abuse .
Many items such as instruments and expensive furniture were reportedly stolen from the home after Joness death .
Rumours also exist that recordings by Jones for his future projects were stolen but nothing has surfaced to date .
A watch given by Alexis Korner to Jones with a personal inscription surfaced in an auction at Christies in New York .
Upon Joness death The Who s Pete Townshend wrote a poem titled A Normal Day for Brian , A Man Who Died Every Day , Jimi Hendrix dedicated a song to him on US television , and Jim Morrison of The Doors published a poem entitled Ode to L.A. .
While Thinking of Brian Jones , Deceased .
Hendrix and Morrison both died within the following two years , both aged 27 , the same as Jones .
The Rolling Stones performed at a free concert in Hyde Park on 5 July 1969 , two days after Joness death .
The concert had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present the Stones new guitarist , Mick Taylor , and the band decided to dedicate the concert to Jones .
Before the Rolling Stones set Jagger read excerpts from Adonais , a poem by Percy Shelley about the death of his friend John Keats , and stagehands released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute .
The band opened with a Johnny Winter song that was one of Joness favourites , Im Yours and Im Hers .
Jones was reportedly buried deep in Cheltenham Cemetery in a lavish casket sent by Bob Dylan .
Watts and Wyman were the only Rolling Stones who attended the funeral .
Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull were travelling to Australia to begin the filming of Ned Kelly ; they stated that their contracts did not allow them to delay the trip to attend the funeral .
Keith Richards reportedly remained in the recording studio .
When asked if he felt guilty about Joness death Mick Jagger told Rolling Stone in 1995 : No , I dont really .
I do feel that I behaved in a very childish way , but we were very young , and in some ways we picked on him .
But , unfortunately , he made himself a target for it ; he was very , very jealous , very difficult , very manipulative , and if you do that in this kind of a group of people you get back as good as you give , to be honest .
I wasnt understanding enough about his drug addiction .
No one seemed to know much about drug addiction .
Things like LSD were all new .
No one knew the harm .
People thought cocaine was good for you .
Theories surrounding Joness death developed soon afterwards with associates of the Stones claiming to have information that he was murdered .
According to rock biographer Philip Norman , the murder theory would bubble back to the surface every five years or so .
In 1993 it was reported that Jones was murdered by Frank Thorogood , who was doing some construction work on the property .
He was the last person to see Jones alive .
Thorogood allegedly confessed to the murder to the Rolling Stones driver , Tom Keylock , who later denied this .
The Thorogood theory was dramatised in the 2005 movie Stoned .
In August 2009 , Sussex Police decided to review Joness death for the first time since 1969 , after new evidence was handed to them by Scott Jones , an investigative journalist in the UK .
Scott Jones had traced many of the people who were at Brian Joness house the night he died plus unseen police files held at the National Archives .
In the Mail on Sunday in November 2008 , Scott Jones said Frank Thorogood killed Brian Jones in a fight and the senior police officers covered up the true cause of death .
Following the review the Sussex police stated that they would not be reopening the case .
They asserted that this has been thoroughly reviewed by Sussex Polices Crime Policy and Review Branch but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroners original verdict of death by misadventure was incorrect .
As such , the case will not be reopened .
Unsure and insecure as a composer , Jones was not a prolific songwriter .
The 30-second Rice Krispies jingle for Kelloggs , co-written with the J. W. Thompson advertising agency in 1963 and performed by the Rolling Stones incognito was credited to Jones ; this did not sit well with the rest of the band , who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally .
Jones was also included in the Nanker/Phelge songwriting credit , a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and Andrew Oldham .
According to Andrew Oldham , the main reason for Joness not writing songs was that Jones , being a blues purist , did not love simple pop music enough .
Oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between Jones and Gene Pitney after becoming bored senseless by Joness bleating about the potential of half-finished melodies that by no means deserved completion , but after two days of sessions the results remain best to be unheard , even by Stones completists .
When asked in 1965 if he had written songs , Jones replied : Always tried .
Ive written quite a few , but mostly in blues style .
Many years later after his death , Keith Richards stated : No , no , absolutely not .
That was the one thing he would never do .
Brian wouldnt show them to anybody within the Stones .
Brian as far as I know never wrote a single finished song in his life ; he wrote bits and pieces but he never presented them to us .
No doubt he spent hours , weeks , working on things , but his paranoia was so great that he could never bring himself to present them to us .
Bill Wyman has stated that Jones was an incredibly gifted musician , but not a song writer ; and in 1995 , Mick Jagger told Rolling Stone that Jones had been jealous of the Jagger/Richards songwriting team , and added : To be honest , Brian had no talent for writing songs .
None .
Ive never known a guy with less talent for songwriting .
Marianne Faithfull reported that Brian Jones wrote an early version of the melody for Ruby Tuesday and presented it to the group .
Victor Bockris reported that Keith Richards and Brian Jones worked out the final melody in the studio .
Additionally , Jones is credited for the instrumental piece Hear It , though it is generally considered Joness work .
However , in 1966 Jones composed , produced , and played on the soundtrack to Mord und Totschlag , an avant-garde German film with Anita Pallenberg , adding the majority of the instrumentation to the soundtrack .
Although guitarist Jimmy Page is one of the three extra musicians Jones hired to play on the soundtrack .
In 1990 , Carla Olson was given permission from Joness estate to put one of his poems to music and thus created the Jones/Olson song Thank You For Being There .
It appeared on the album True Voices , performed by Krysia Kristianne and Robin Williamson .
In summer 1968 , Jones recorded the Morocco-based ensemble , the Master Musicians of Joujouka , as the name of the Moroccan mountain village was spelled at the time , the more correct spelling of the Arabic name being Jajouka , which was later used by the band ; the recording was released in 1971 as Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka .
Jagger and Richards visited Jajouka in 1989 after recording Continental Drift for the Rolling Stones album Steel Wheels with The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar in Tangier .
A homage to Jones entitled Brian Jones Joujouka very Stoned , painted by Mohamed Hamri , who had brought Jones to Jajouka in 1967 , appeared on the cover of Joujouka Black Eyes by the Master Musicians of Joujouka in 1995 , this being a splinter group created by an Irish friend of the former and estranged Moroccan manager , Mohamed Hamri .
Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Jajouka was rereleased in cooperation with Bachir Attar and Philip Glass in 1995 .
The executive producers were Philip Glass , Kurt Munkasci and Rory Johnston , with notes by Bachir Attar , Paul Bowles , William S. Burroughs , Stephen Davis , Brian Jones , Brion Gysin and David Silver .
and included additional graphics , more extensive notes by David Silver and William S. Burroughs , and a second CD , produced by Cliff Mark , with two full-length remixes .
In mid-May 1967 , Jones played oboe on The Beatles Baby , Youre a Rich Man .
Jones played alto saxophone on The Beatles song You Know My Name , which was released in March 1970 , eight months after his death .
Jones was tall with blue-grey eyes and blond hair .
Anita Pallenberg has stated in an interview that he wanted to look like Francoise Hardy , he loved dressing up and posing about and that he would ask her to do his hair and make-up .
Bo Diddley described Brian as a little dude that was trying to pull the group ahead .
I saw him as the leader .
He didnt take no mess .
He was a fantastic cat ; he handled the group beautifully .
Joness death at 27 was the first of the 1960s rock movement ; Jimi Hendrix , Janis Joplin , and Jim Morrison found their own drug-related deaths at the same age within two years .
The coincidence of ages has been described as the 27 Club .
When Alastair Johns , who owned Cotchford Farm for over 40 years after Joness death , refurbished the pool , he sold the original tiles to Joness fans for PS100 each , which paid for half of the work .
Johns noted that Cotchford Farm remained for decades an attraction for Joness fans .
Jagger wrote The Stones Shine a Light after Joness death , depicts Joness behaviour and remoteness from the band , and asks God to shine a light on his soul .
Several other songs have been written about Jones : Morrison originally wrote The Doors song Tightrope Ride for Jones , but after Morrisons death Ray Manzarek rewrote some of the lyrics so that they apply to both musicians .
The Psychic TV song Godstar is about Joness death , as are Robyn Hitchcock s Trash , The Drovers Shes as Pretty as Brian Jones Was , Ted Nugent s Death by Misadventure , and Salmonblaster s Brian Jones .
Toy Love s song Swimming Pool lists several dead rock icons including Jones ; Jones is also mentioned in De Phazz s song Something Special .
The Master Musicians of Joujouka song Brian Jones Joujouka Very Stoned was released in 1974 and 1996 .
The Brian Jonestown Massacre band named itself partially after him .
Many of his contemporaries admit to idolizing him as young musicians , including Noel Redding , who , according to Pamela Des Barres s book Im With the Band , contemplated suicide after hearing about his death .
The 2005 film Stoned is a fictional account of Jones and his role in the Rolling Stones .
The part of Brian was played by English actor Leo Gregory .
A fictionalised version of Jones and the tribute concert to him appears in Alan Moore and Kevin ONeill s in its second issue , Paint it Black .
His exceptional musicianship as well as contribution to the band is featured heavily in the documentary Crossfire Hurricane

Khyal is the modern genre of classical singing in North India .
Its name comes from an Arabic word meaning imagination .
It is not thought to have developed out of the qawwa .
singing style .
It appeared more recently than dhrupad , is a more free and flexible form , and it provides greater scope for improvisation .
Like all Indian classical music , khyal is modal , with a single melodic line and no harmonic parts .
The modes are called raga , and each raga is a complicated framework of melodic rules .
Khyal bases itself on a repertoire of short songs ; a khyal song is called a bandish .
Every singer generally renders the same bandish differently , with only the text and the raga remaining the same .
Khyal bandishes are typically composed in a variant of Urdu/Hindi , and sometimes in Persian , Marathi or Punjabi , and these compositions cover diverse topics , such as romantic or divine love , praise of kings or gods , the seasons , dawn and dusk , and the pranks of Krishna , and they can have symbolism and imagery .
The bandish is divided into two parts -- the sthayi and the antara , with the former considered more important as it shows the melodic contours of the raga .
The sthayi often uses notes from the lower octave and the lower half of the middle octave , while the antara ascends to the tonic of the upper octave and beyond before descending and linking back to the sthayi .
The singer uses the composition as raw material for improvisation , accompanied by a harmonium or bowed string instrument such as the sarangi or violin playing off the singers melody line , a set of two hand drums , and a drone in the background .
The role of the accompanist playing the melody-producing instrument is to provide continuity when the singer pauses for breath , using small variations of the singers phrases or parts thereof .
While there is a wide variety of rhythmic patterns that could be used by the percussionist , khyal performances typically use Ektaal , Jhoomra , Jhaptaal , Tilwada , Tintal , Rupak , and Adachautaal .
A typical khyal performance uses two songs -- the bada khyal or great khyal , in slow tempo , comprises most of the performance , while the chhota khyal , in fast tempo , is used as a finale and is usually in the same raga but a different taal .
The songs are sometimes preceded by improvised alap to sketch the basic raga structure without drum accompaniment ; alap is given much less room in khyal than in dhrupad .
As the songs are short , and performances long , the lyrics lose some of their importance .
Improvisation is added to the songs in a number of ways : for example improvising new melodies to the words , using the syllables of the songs to improvise material , singing the names of the scale degrees -- sa , re , ga , ma , pa , dha and ni -- or simply interspersing phrases sung on vowels , usually the vowel A , akaar taans .
Taans are one of the major distinguishing features of the khyal .
Now and then , the singer returns to the song , especially its first line , as a point of reference .
Besides the vilambit and drut tempos , a performance may include ati-vilambit , madhya and ati-drut tempos .
Song forms such as taranas , thumris or tappas are sometimes used to round off a khyal performance .
Khayal was popularized by Niyamat Khan and his nephew Firoz Khan , both musicians in the court of Muhammad Shah Rangile .
It seems likely that khyal already existed at the time , although perhaps not in the present form .
The compositions of Sadarang and Adarang employ the theme of Hindi love-poetry .
The khyal of this period also acquired the dignity of Dhrupad and the manner of the veena in its glide or meend , plus a number of musical alankars that were introduced into the body of the composition .
The gharana system arose out of stylistic rendering of the khyal by various subsequent generations of musicians .
The gharanas have distinct styles of presenting the khyal -- how much to emphasize and how to enunciate the words of the composition , when to sing the sthayi and antara , whether to sing an unmetered alap in the beginning , whether to do bol-alap or aakar-alap , what kinds of improvisations to use , how much importance to give to the rhythmic aspect , and so on .
With India united into a country from various scattered princely states , with royal courts and the zamindari system abolished , and with modern communications and recording technology , stylistic borders have become blurred and many singers today have studied with teachers from more than one gharana .
This used to be uncommon , and a few decades ago teachers used to forbid students to even hear other gharana singers perform , not allowing them to buy records or listen to the radio .
Today , as always , a singer is expected to develop an individual style , albeit one that is demonstrably linked to tradition

richi adhyoodham sam Rci adhyuuddhrm saam .
Hence Sam is composition of words in Rigvedic hymns into notes .
The richa-s or hymns of Rigveda are called yoni or adhar as they form the base of Samgan .
In musicological parlance Sam Veda has taken matu from Rigveda and provided dhatu to these words .
Archik.aarcik Only a few hymns in Sam Veda Samhita were not based upon richa-s taken from Rigveda .
The bulk being based on Rigveda is known as Archik .
It has two parts .
Poorvarchik .
puurvaarcik 585 Richa-s are sub-grouped into 6 Prapathak-s .
Each Prapathak has two Ardh-s .
Each Ardh has 10 Dashati-s .
A collection of ten is called a Dashati .
Uttararchik .
uttraarcik It has 1225 richa-s contained in 9 Prapathak-s , first five having two ardh-s each and the remaining four having three ardh-s each .
Aranyak Samhita .
arnnyk smhitaa It is merely a collection of verses that could be sung .
Patanjalis statement , sahasravartma samvedah shsrvrtm smvedH gives rises to speculation that there were a thousand branches of Sam , while he poetically indicated there could be a thousand ways in which Sam could be sung .
In Samtarpan there are a maximum of 13 Acharya-s but today there are only three branches .
Archik grantha contains hymns that are yoni or base to Gan or singing .
The collections of suitably modified richa-s are known as Gan-grantha .
These are the true Sam .
Sam created on richa-s of Poorvarchik are called Gram-gan , graamgaan Gramegeya-gan , graamgeyogaan Prakriti-gan prkRtigaan or Veya-gan veygaan .
Sam created on richa-s of Aranyak Samhita are termed Aranya-gan arnnyaagaan or Aranyageya-gan arnnygeyogaan .
Sam created on richa-s of Uttararchik are known as Ooh-gan .
uuhgaan .
The Sanskrit root ooh means to modify according to need .
Aranyageya-gan : Practiced in solitude of forest .
Also called Rahasyageyo-gan .
Ooh-gan : Pragath-s specially created for yajna on basis of Gramgeyo-gan .
Oohya-gan uuhygaan : Pragath-s created for yajna on basis of Rahasyageyo-gan .
There is a difference in number of songs attributed to different branches .
Shri Satvalekar in preface to Samveda Samhita has given the following table of songs .
Fox Strangways in Music of Hindustan says , Vocal scales are conceived downwards .
They are so conceived , because the telling notes of the voice in its upper register , and this presents itself , therefore as the starting point for a vocal scale .
The Sayan # - bhashya on Sam-vidhan Brahmin establishes that note of Sam were of nidhan prakriti and followed a descending order .
In Naradiya Shiksha the seven notes of Sam are First , Second , Third , Fourth , Mandra , Krushta and Atiswar .
This indicates that initially only three or four notes were used for Samgan .
Archik songs were sung on the basis of just one note , e.g. Sa Sa Sa , or Ni Ni Ni .
This kind of chanting was well suited to Havan , Mantra-path and Jap .
Gathik songs were hymns in praise of deities and used two notes , e.g. Ni Ni Ni Ni , Sa Sa Sa Sa .
Samic songs for the first time used three notes .
The word Samic is taken to mean three notes .
The songs were like Ga Ga Re Re Sa Sa Sa .
Apart from these three basic notes , the singers came across a fourth which they called Swarantar .
When they discovered a note lower than the lowest known note they called it Mandra .
When a still lower note than Mandra was found they called it Atiswar .
A higher note determined was called Krushta after Sanskrit root Krush .
So the complete Samic Saptak in descending order contains : .
To preserve the Samik notes , Raga Sameshwari was created .
Dr. Lalmani Misra first translated the notes M G R S D N P into Shadja gram -- S N D P G M R -- and then created a Raga which is performed in the evening .
Shruti-jati is defined as the way in which a particular note could be applied to make the song appealing .
There are five with individual signs for three shruti-jati-s .
The hymn part of the Vedas are called Samhitas .
Brahmanas are the earliest known text after the Vedas were written , as explanation and appendices of Vedas , and guides to the custom and practice of vedic singing and ritual .
The Upanisads and the Aranyakas became in turn appendices to the Brahmanas .
Upanishad or Vedanta deal with systematic treatment of metaphysical questions and form the philosophical basis of Hinduism .
They are dated from 1000 BC to 300 BC , the end of the Vedic period to the beginning of Puranic period .
The Pre-Buddha time is considered Early Brahmana period and Post-Buddha period is considered the Later Brahmana period .
The oral texts were composed by a great number of rishis .
Though upanishads number more than a hundred , there are about 8 to 12 principal ones .
All upanishads are based on one of the four Vedas .
Upanisads deal with various subjects such as the nature of Brahman , the ideal human conduct , the practice of yoga , the nature of Atman , creation of the world , creation of humanity , the nature of reality , the nature of true knowledge and ignorance , the nature of consciousness , the concept of karma , and incarnation of soul .
A Rishi in Rig Veda is an author of a Rik , a hymn mantra , derived from oral tradition and direct insight , not from reasoning or intellect .
Envisioned are beings beyond the range of human senses , conceived from self-evident knowledge and realized Truth by direct intuition .
Rishi Vamadeva , in hymn describes himself as the illumined one , expressing his Truth revealed .
The term Rishi is defined as rishati jnanena samsara-param '' meaning one who goes beyond the mundane world by means of knowledge .
Further , some scholars think the root drish might have given rise to root rish meaning to see .
Rishi is therefore a divine seer , a drastara , one who visualizes a mantra .
Also the one who hears the voices and song .
The seers were the hearers of the Truth .
Sri Aurobindo described Shruthi as divine recordings of cosmic sounds of truth heard by the Rishis .
The Vedas are thus Shruthis , revealed scriptures .
That is the reason , the Vedas are Apaurusheya , not authored by any agency .
The Rig Veda contains 10,552 hymns ; grouped into 1,028 Sukthas each of roughly ten mantras , spread over ten Mandalas .
The Mandalas are of differing sizes .
These mantra songs are authored by some 400 Rishis of whom about 30 were women .
Of the ten Mandalas six Mandalas , numbering from 2 to 7 are homogenous in character and are considered the oldest parts of the Rig Veda .
Each of these six books was composed by a Rishi and by members of the Rishi family/disciples and of the Gotra , and are therefore often called Family Books .
Books 1 , 8 and 10 composed by different individual Rishis .
The Books 1 and 8 are almost Family Books as a majority of their hymns are composed by the family of Kanvas and many hymns are found in both the Books .
The Book 9 is different from the rest ; all the hymns therein are addressed to Soma , from groups of Rishis .
The tenth Book is an addition of various early and late hymns .
Books 1 and 10 are the latest and longest , accounting for about 40 percent of the bulk of the Rig Veda .
Certain texts called Anukramani serve as Index to the Rig Veda and provide information about each hymn of the Rig Veda .
The most well-known of the Aukramani is Katyayana 's sarvanukramani and is dated around the 2nd century .
The entries in the texts mention each hymn , specifying the name of the Rishi who authored the hymn , or transposed them into writing ; the Devatha who inspired or to whom the hymn is addressed ; and the Chandas or the metre of the hymn .
These are extremely useful in historical analysis of the Rig Veda

Dhamar is one of the talas used in Hindustani classical music .
It is associated with the dhrupad style and typically played on the pakhawaj .
Dhamar tala has 14 beats grouped asymmetrically into a 5-2-3-4 pattern .
A song in dhrupad style set to dhamar tala is also called a dhamar .
The text of a dhamar concerns the antics of Krishna teasing the milkmaids during the Holi Spring Festival of colours .
It is considered a relatively light and romantic musical form .
In counting out the beat , beats 1 , 6 , and 11 are clapped , and beat 8 is indicated by a wave of the hand :
An electronic tanpura is an electronic instrument that replicates the sound of an Indian string instrument known as the tanpura .
In Indian music , drone is a basic function of the music .
The development of a raga , any composition or song within raga presupposes and requires the continuous sounding of the key-note , its octave and another tone , usually the fifth or fourth .
Traditionally drone is provided by one or more tanpura player , especially for vocal performances .
The electronic tanpura was created as a marketable , practical solution for instrumentalists , having their hands otherwise engaged , who can not readily avail themselves of able tanpura players for their long hours of private practice .
Since the late 1970s , little white boxes appeared , first privately , then gradually coming openly to the stage as the technological sophistication of the models advanced .
In Indian solfege , called Sargam , Sa is the tonic , Ma , Pa and Ni are 4th , 5th and 7th tone degrees within the octave .
Generally , the electronic tanpura has one or more dials to control the tone and volume , and may have other switches and buttons that allow a certain pitch and volume to be saved and used again at a later time .
The range is usually one to two octaves .
For many musicians the electronic tanpura is a practical commodity .
It delivers a passable substitute for a real , live tanpura .
Certainly , it is much easier and less expensive than maintaining a live tanpura player .
However , the electronic tanpura is a poor substitute when compared to a good tanpura in expert hands as the tones it creates lack the dynamics of a live musician , producing a mechanical , repetitive sound .
The electronic tanpura was first invented by G Raj Narayan , an engineer-flautist from Bangalore , India , and demonstrated at the annual conference of the Music Academy Chennai in December 1979 .
The products were manufactured by the company he founded , Radel .
The first versions were created with the technology then available , using discrete components and transistors .
In the late 1990s , these gave way to models using sampled recordings of the traditional tanpura on a chip .
Over the last decade , these have been further refined and the latest models can hardly be distinguished from a traditional acoustic tanpura .
The success of this invention gave rise to many other players who then started manufacturing and aggressively marketing bad copies of these products .
These copies have earned a bad name as the little white boxes and comparisons are made to the traditional acoustic tanpuras
In Hindustani classical music , vivadi refers to pitches that are not part of the arohana or avrohana of a given raga .
In general , vivadi are not to be played during an improvisation on a given raga .
So , for instance , if a raga had the structure S R G m P D N S , S N D P m G R S ; in that case , r , g , M , d and n would all be vivadi .
Although vivadi pitches are generally to be avoided during the playing of a given raga , they are occasionally added by skilled performers in order to introduce some color to an interpretation .
In Carnatic music , vivadi is used in vivadi swaram , vivadi dhosha , vivadi ragam , and by extension vivadi melakarta .
Vivadi term means going against the grain of thought or approach .
A swaram is said to be vivadi in relationship with another swaram , if there is a discordant effect produced by the swaram in relation to the other .
It is different from Apaswaram , which is incorrect swaram or incorrect rendition / pitch / frequency deviating from the swaram itself .
A ragam is vivadi if it contains vivadi swarams , especially with the vadi swaram of the ragam .
The ragam still is a valid scale and compositions are made using such ragams too .
Examples of popular Vivadi ragas are : Nata , Varali , Vagadheeswari .
A Melakarta ragam is vivadi if it contains vivadi swarams .
40 of the 72 Melakarta ragams have vivadi swaras .
Dhosha means negative effect .
Vivadi ragams are said to have vivadi dhosha , which can be overcome by singing the vivadi swarams in certain phrases that are said to reduce the negative effect .

Pandit Basavraj Rajguru was born at Yaliwal , a village in the north Karnataka district of Dharwad , a great centre of Hindustani classical music .
He was a leading Hindustani vocal musician in the Kirana Gharana .
Due perhaps to his aversion for publicity and his simple and scholarly lifestyle , he never achieved the level of fame of his contemporaries Bhimsen Joshi and Gangubai Hangal of the same gharana .
He received many awards , including the Padma Bhushan .
Born into a family of scholars , astrologers and musicians , Basavraj was initiated into classical music at an early age by his father , who was himself a renowned Carnatic musician trained in Tanjavur .
Later he travelled widely in search of musical knowledge to which he dedicated his entire life .
He chose to live a quiet life away from glamour and its attendant trappings .
He excelled both as performer and teacher .
Besides being a great classicalist , Rajaguru was adept at composing and singing vachanas which made his music more accessible to the general public of Karnataka state .
Basavaraj was fond of music from a very young age .
He would try to persuade drama producers and actors to let him sing in their plays , and first became known while singing for Vamanrao Master 's traveling drama company .
When he was 13 years old , he lost his father .
His uncle became concerned about his future in drama .
By a fortuitous stroke of fate , the blind Ganayogi Panchakshari Gawai discovered Basavraj and with little convincing from the MaTh 's swamiji , took the lad into his tutelage .
Since then his music embraced a whole new beginning .
Panchakshari Gawai gave all his musical knowledge to Basavraj and other students who were not in a position to pay guru dakshina to their guru .
He mastered several Ragas and styles .
He also became adept at some other arts like wrestling , swimming and cooking .
His teacher would personally make sure that each of his students practiced for at least 12 to 15 hours a day .
When Basavraj graduated he asked his guru what he wanted as gurudakshina , and his guru replied that this would consist of Basavraj passing on what he had learnt from his guru to his own disciples .
In 1936 at the 600th anniversary of the Vijayanagar Empire in Hampi , Basavraj gave his first concert with his guru Gawai .
Fifteen thousand people listened silently to the young musician singing Bageshri and the vachana Nijaguna Shivayogi .
After the passing away of Panchakshari Gawai in 1944 , Basavraj moved to Bombay and had the chance to learn from the legendary Kirana musician and teacher Sawai Gandharva .
But Sawai Gandharva was suffering from paralysis and had to leave Bombay , so he told Sureshbabu Mane , another great Kirana musician and Guru of Dr. Prabha Atre , to take good care of Basavraj .
After learning from him , Rajagurus quest took him to the North West of Pakistan , where he learned from Ustad Waheed khan , Gawai 's guru .
In Karachi he learnt from Ustad Latif Khan for six months .
He was not afraid to accept any challenge .
Once he had to sing after Ustad Nishad Khan and he went up to the stage confidently and Ustad Nishad Khan had to accept his defeat from Basavraj .
On another occasion it is reported that Chhote Ghulam sang Raga Todi so well that nobody dared to defeat him , but the young Basavraj did .
During the partition of India and Pakistan in 1947 , Ustad Latif Khan advised him to take a train carrying thousands of Hindus across the border .
The train was stopped and attacked on the border but Basavraj managed to escape by clinging to the bottom of the carriage all the way from the border to Delhi .
His fame had spread far and wide and continued to spread ; concert invitations came from every corner of the country .
His repertoire ranged from the pure classical , Dhrupad to Vachanas , Natyageet , Thumri , and Ghazal spanning eight languages .
He knew more than forty types of raga and he would sing them one after another right then and there .
After his concert in Delhi information minister , B.V. Keskar announced , Arre , hamare Rajguru to hukumi yekka hai !

At another concert Begum Akhtar , declared , Rajguru yane sur ka badshah .
or Rajguru signifies the king of music .
The Government of India bestowed upon him the Padma Shri in 1975 and the Padma Bhushan in 1991 .
He also received Sangeet Natak Akademi awards from central and state governments .
He was also awarded with prestigious titles by various organizations and an honorary doctorate by the Karnataka University , Dharwad .
Besides being an accomplished and talented singer , Rajaguru was patient and caring towards his students .
He would never get tired of repeating taans for his students ; he would never get angry .
He would always tell his students that no matter how great they were , if they couldnt pass on what they had acquired to somebody else , the greatness would be worthless .
He was a strict vegetarian and never even tasted tea in his life .
He had a very strict regimen of Puja , sadhna , teaching and walking .
His diet was oriented towards preserving his voice and he never ate or drank anything fried , frozen or fatty .
His dream of coming to U.S. eluded him .
He had planned a concert tour in the U.S. in the fall of 1991 , and he got a performer 's visa , but on his way back to Dharwad he had a minor heart attack and was admitted to a hospital in Bangalore .
His disciple , Nachiketa Sharma was beside him when he breathed his last .
He told Nachiketa to pick the Tambura and sing the SA for him , and declared it was time for him to leave this world .
Basavraj Rajguru died in July 1991 , one of three illustrious Dharwad musicians to do so during this period .
After his death , his wife and Nachiketa Sharma carried his dead body on 21 July 1991 to Dharwad , where their taxi was greeted by the whole city .
Pt .
Mallikarjun Mansur paying his last respects to Rajaguru declared , Even in his death he looks like a king !

The first Pt .
Basavaraj Rajguru Memorial National Award was conferred on vocalist Pt .
Ullas Kashalkar of Kolkata on 23 August 2011 during the 91st birth anniversary of Pandit Basavaraj Rajguru .

Mushtaq Ali Khan and was an Indian sitar , surbahar player .
His father Ashiq Ali Khan was a renowned sitar player .
His musical ancestor tree includes Masit Sen , the originator of Masitkhani Baaj .
He was recognized as the foremost representative of the Senia gharana of sitar playing in the mid-20th century .
At first a court musician at Jaunpur , he left the court to pursue an independent career .
He started playing for All India Radio in 1929 , and performed at the 1931 Sangeet Sammelan in Allahabad .
For all of the 1940s and most of the 1950s he was considered the most prominent sitar player in India , following the demise of Enayat Khan of the Etawah Gharana , and prior to the rise of the young Ravi Shankar and Vilayat Khan in the mid-1950s .
In 1968 he won the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award , highest Indian recognition given to practicing artists , given by Sangeet Natak Akademi , Indias National Academy of Music , Dance & Drama .
Being a purist , Khan-Saheb refused to yield to shifting popular tastes and to adopt the innovations introduced by Ravi Shankar on one hand and Vilayat Khan on the other , which lead to a gradual decline in his popularity .
At the time of his death he was known as a musicians musician .
Many of Indias best known musicians expressed their appreciation of the purity of his style and musicality in a book published in Delhi after his death .
Khan started his instruction at the age of 6 .
He learned from his father , Ashiq Ali Khan , who had learned sitar from the renowned 19th century player Barkatullah Khan , a descendant of Masit Sen of Delhi , the inventor of the Masitkhani gat His name became synonymous with the Senia style although he may actually have practiced an even more austere style than his predecessors in the gharana .
He eschewed much of the ornamentation of modern sitar technique , and embraced a clean , pure sound .
His alap was constructed along the lines of a dhrupad alap , and his jod and jhalla derived a lot from been technique .
Oddly enough , in spite of being a musical descendant of Masit Sen , he rarely played Masitkhani gats in public , and none of the commercially available examples of his music includes one .
He opted to play the faster Rezakhani gats instead , feeling that playing Masitkhani gats to an undiscerning audience would cause them to be devalued .
Mushtaq Ali Khan was an eminent Sitar player of Senia Gharana .
He was the only surbahar player of India who used to play the been-ang with three mizrabs and that too , with the pakhawaj as an accompanying instrument only in pure dhrupad style .
In a rare exclusive interview in the Daily Telegraph on the 13 July 1985 , Khan Sahab narrated the history of this instrument with historical references in which he has cleared the myth of this instrument .
Khan Sahab had his lineage with fifth vani , called Dhandvani named after one of the forefathers .
The famous dhrupadiya of Shah Jahans Court , Nayak Dhundhu .
It is also called Rasal Vani for its beauty .
He said , ... two of my ancestors , Jaggu Khan and Makku Khan .
Since Makku Khan was childless , he adopted Waras Ali Khan a great name who learnt the art of playing Been from Bade Mohammed Khan .
When my father Ashiq Ali Khan was six years old , my grand father Sadaq Ali Khan , son of Jaggu Khan died so his uncle Waras Ali Khan taught him all intricacies of Beena on the surbahar .
That is why we play Surbahar with three Mezrabs .
The Surbahar was originally designed to felicitate the playing of Alap .
Those days Alap was the exclusive prerogative of the Beenkar .
Ghulam Muhammed Khan and his son Sajjad Mohammed Khan the great SurBahar players used to stay at Calcutta in the earliest part of the 20th Century and taught many renowned players including Imdad Khan and Jnanoda Mukherjee .
In this instrument two angas played are alap and talparan and that is why the knowledge of pakhawaj is essential to play the Talparan ... Mustaq Ali Khan also had to learn the art of pakhawaj playing in order to achieve perfection in the art of playing the surbahar with Pakhawaj .
Mushtaq Ali Khan was awarded the Sangeet Natak Academy award in 1968 .
In 1973/74 he received the title of D.Litt from Rabindra Bharati University .
The Indian government appointed him as the Professor Emeritus in Education and the Cultural Ministry and gave fellowship .
Some of the other musical awards were Sitar Sudhakar - 1932 , Tantri Vilas - 1973 , Sangeet Ratnakar - 1974 , State Academy Award - 1974 , Senior fellowship and Emeritus - 1986 , Bhuwalka Award - 1987 , Tansen Award - 1987 , Special Honour University of Delhi - 1987 .
His foremost disciples are Nirmal Guha Thakurta , Netai Bose , Shipra Chaudhury , Steven Landsberg and Dr. Debu Chaudhuri .
Latter is now the only living and/or active amongst this quartet .
He has started a cultural Centre in New Delhi under the name of UMAK CENTRE FOR CULTURE , with a view to have UMAKs music and his ideas alive , for the future generation those who will have regards for purity and tradition .
Such great Masters are not understood well during their own time which is a sad story and reflection on our knowledge and understanding .
Steven Landsberg is Khansahibs only student to have studied the Surbahar , the technique with three mizrabas , and tarparan .
A follower of rasal vani , Khan Sahab was the only surbahar player who not only maintained the purity of the Rasdal Vani but also kept its purity alive till his last days and never diluted to please the masses and that is why his music was not understood by the masses but respected by the contemporary Great Masters .
On 1953 had a Subahar recital in Raga Purya , in the First National Programme of the All India Radio New Delhi .
It may be recalled that in the year 1953 Pandit Ravi Shankar was instrumental of instituting this National Programme of All India Radio and was present on this memorable occasion and praised Kahn Sahab profusely for his superb exposition of Raga Purya in a pure Dhrupad style with three Mezrabs .
He was a musicians musician and that is why he always shied away from the commercial attention .
Instead Mushtag Ali Khan organised conferences where old masters and new artists were introduced to the cognoscenti and the novice .
Among the well known names , Pandit Ravi Shankar was first presented by him to the public in Calcutta .
Ustad had his undisputed popularity and demand during the early thirties to late forties .
Even in the evening of his illustrious career , he and his wife Begum Kaneez Khatoon were actively involved in variety of projects for promotion of art and culture in our country .
He died on 21 July 1989
Tappa is a form of Indian semi-classical vocal music .
Its specialty is its rolling pace based on fast , subtle and knotty construction .
Its tunes are melodious , sweet and depict the emotional outbursts of a lover .
Tappas were sung mostly by songstresses , known as Baigees , in royal courts .
Tappa originated from the folk songs of the camel riders of Punjab , the Tappa style of music was refined and introduced to the imperial court of the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah .
And later on by Mian Ghulam Nabi Shori or Shori Mian , a court singer of Asaf-Ud-Dowlah , Nawab of Awadh .
In Bengal , Ramnidhi Gupta composed Bengali tappas and they are called as Nidhu Babus Tappa .
Tappa gayaki took new shape and over decades became puratani , a semi-classical form of Bengali songs .
Tappa , as a significant genre in Bengali musical styles , reached levels of excellence in lyrics and rendition , arguably unmatched in other parts of India .
Hugely popular in the latter half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th , Tappa was the genre of choice of the wealthy elite as well as the classes with more modest means .
An evolved format of the tappa was the baithaki style , which evolved under the direct patronage of the landed elites of the zamindari classes of the late 19th and early 20th centuries , in their baithak-khanas and jalsaghar .
Composers of repute included Bidyasundar , Roopchaand Pakkhi , Dadathakur , Hiralal Sarkhel and many others .
Unfortunately , tappa being mainly a vocal tradition , a lot of priceless material from the body of art has been lost in the passage of time .
A lot of celebrated artists have passed away before recordings of music became common .
What is left today is mainly handed down from the generations by oral traditions as well as some written matter , occasionally turned up in the course of research .
Ramkumar Chattopadhyay was perhaps the most significant vocal proponent in recent times , of the tappa style in Bengal , renowned for his semi-humorous and majorly artistic renditions and his comical incorporation of English into the Bengali lyrics , either his own translations or his anecdotal translations based on prior sources , ostensibly for the comprehension of the British sahibs in the British Raj era , but containing many subversive and sarcastic tones in the English transliterations , clearly against the Imperial regime , but subtly put so as not to arouse the suspicion of the strict and sensitive colonial government and invite charges of sedition .

Among the prominent living performers of this style are Pt .
Laxmanrao Pandit of Gwalior , Shanno Khurana , Pt .
Manvalkar of Gwalior , Girija Devi of Benaras , Dr. Ishwarchandra R. Karkare of Gwalior , Smt .
Malini Rajurkar , Shri .
Sharad Sathe , Manjiri Asnare Kelkar of Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana and Pandit Yashpaul of the Agra Gharana .
In Bengal , there is a current resurgence of the tappa , with fresh talent beginning to carve out their niches , such as Riddhi , Srikumar Chattopadhyay , Pritam Bhattacharjee , and many others

Mohammad Sabir Baburaj , also known as M. S. Baburaj , was a Malayalam music composer .
He is often credited for the renaissance of Malayalam film music .
Baburaj has rendered music to many evergreen Malayalam film songs .
Baburaj was born on 29 March 1921 in Kozhikode , then known as Calicut .
His early childhood was spent in destitution and poverty .
His father , Jan Muhammed Khan , who was a Hindustani musician from Bengal who frequently held concerts in Kerala , deserted his Malayali mother when he was very young , and returned to his native Kolkata .
Baburaj thus became a fatherless , often singing songs in trains to make a living .
But as luck would have it , a policeman , Kunjahammed , an enthusiast of music , from his native town of Kozhikode , noticing the boys vocal talents , decided to virtually adopt him .
One of his greatest achievements was the introduction of Hindustani strains into Malayalam popular music .
He successfully composed melodies based on Hindustani Ragas and blended Malayalam lyrics into them .
Most of the lyrics were written by eminent Malayalam poets like P. Bhaskaran and Vayalar .
Baburaj learned basic lessons of Hindustani music from his father from a very young age , but he could not learn it for long due to his fathers demise .
In search of pure music , young Baburaj visited West Bengal , Mumbai and Sri Lanka .
He learned Harmonium in these period .
He came back to Kerala to a miserable life .
He sang on the streets of Kozhikode to earn his livelihood.Police constable Kunju Muhammed , who was a fan of Baburajs father adopted him and brought up .
Later he started composing music for the Malayalam dramas in the Malabar region and thus slowly entered the field of music direction .
In 1957 , he composed music for the Malayalam film `` Minnaminungu '' , by Ramu Kariat , thus entered the Malayalam film industry .
Baburaj was also an accomplished singer and harmonium player .
Baburaj died an early death , on 7 October 1978 at the age of 57 .
He was survived by his wife and children .
The Baburaj - P. Bhaskaran - Yesudas combination produced many of the most memorable tunes of the 60s and 70s .
Most of his classic duets were sung by K. J. Yesudas & S. Janaki , each recording solo Baburaj compositions as well .
The Baburaj - S. Janaki partnership is sometimes compared to that of Madan Mohan and Lata Mangeshkar combination of Hindi Music .
Many of Baburajs songs remain wildly popular in Kerala to date , with songs like Oru Pushpam Maatram frequently rendered on stage at various events .
The Manorama Music company , chanced upon an old audio cassette of Baburaj rendering some of his own compositions .
It was recorded during one of those heady musical evenings that Baburaj and his friends occasionally indulged in , towards the end 1960s , when most his greatest hits were composed .
The cassette was re-mixed and became an instant hit .
The tracks gave Kerala a rejuvenated taste of Baburajs music .
Though a successful composer , Baburaj was never a careerist .
Today , various clubs and musical organisations conduct stage programs in honor of Baburaj , and hand over the proceeds to his family.As with the case with many erstwhile musical geniuses , Baburaj concentrated solely on his music .
During his time , money was not easy to come for artists , and Baburaj was never managed to earn much , dying a poor mans death .
` Thrikkakkare theerthakkare ' in the 1978 film ` Yagaswam ' directed by Hariharan was his last recorded song .
The following is an incomplete list of movies that Baburaj had composed songs for .
All the films are in Malayalam

Known as Baba , the latter is recognised as one of the great Indian classical music innovators of the twentieth century , having composed up to 600 pieces of music and been responsible for modernising two of its most important string instruments - the sitar and the sarod .
Author Peter Lavazzoli credits Babas various contributions as having shaped ... much of what the West knows as Indian classical music via Shankar and Khans subsequent work .
Of the two musicians , Khan , as a master sarodya , was the first to achieve international recognition , with a visit to New York that culminated in his 1955 album .
The latter was the first album of Indian classical music , While highly regarded as solo artists , Shankar and Khans duets , known as jugalbandi , were similarly acclaimed from the 1950s onwards .
Music critic Ken Hunt writes of the tigerish potential for male and female dialogue in their jugalbandi combination .
Compared to the more traditional musical path adopted by Khan , Born in East Bengal , Khan joined Shankar on stage at Madison Square Garden , New York , in August 1971 for the Concert for Bangladesh , organised by Harrison .
Just over a year afterwards , on 8 October 1972 , Shankar and Khan were recorded at another New York venue , the Philharmonic Hall , accompanied again by Rakha .
Shankar often commented on the warm reception afforded him by audiences in America , where New York had been the first Western city to embrace Indian music .
As at the Bangladesh shows , there was a poignancy to this 1972 performance , following the death of Allauddin Khan in September that year .
As their music guru , Baba had remained a revered figure in their lives , and a man considered a saint in his home town of Maihar .
In My Music , My Life , Shankars 1968 autobiography , he writes admiringly of Baba followa way of life that was a beautiful fusion of the best of both Hinduism and Islam , and being similarly broadminded in his musical vision by -LSB- leading us away from the confines of narrow specialization that prevailed in our music .
The ensuing duet at the Philharmonic Hall was a passionate musical exchange between Shankar and Khan , a performance that far surpasses a tribute frozen in time , according to Hunt .
In a role that he had introduced as an ambassador for Indian classical music , Shankar first addressed the New York audience , to explain what the loss of Allauddin Khan meant to Indian music .
Providing the drone-like accompaniment behind Shankar and Khan during the concert were two tambura players , named as Ashoka and Susan on the album credits .
Lavezzoli writes of Shankars longstanding association with his tabla player that Rakha was the ideal partner , given the drummers broad training .
Continuing Babas efforts to elevate tabla from its previous , secondary status , Shankar allowed the drums more space in his performances , ensuring that the tabla became recognised as a solo instrument .
Hem Bihag , an evening raga , was followed by a night raga , Manj Khamaj , a piece that had appeared on Shankars At the Woodstock Festival live album .
The final selection was a morning raga , Sindhi Bhairavi .
Khan had recorded this piece as side one of Music of India , and Shankar similarly included it on The Sounds of India , a 1957 album that Lavezzoli describes as his own counterpart to Khans debut release .
The Philharmonic Hall recording became In Concert 1972 , made up of the three ragas spread over four LP sides and totalling over 140 minutes of music .
An Apple Records release via Shankars friendship with Harrison , the double album was produced in London by Harrison midway through sessions for his Living in the Material World album .
Harrisons co-producers were Rakhas son Zakir Hussain , and sound engineer Phil McDonald .
Apple Records issued In Concert 1972 in January 1973 in the United States , and three months later in Britain .
Billboard magazine carried an Apple trade ad with a tagline beginning : Within the small community of Brilliantly Gifted Musicians there exists an even smaller world of Masters .
Two of these masters recently joined together in concert ... The double album appeared at the same time as a flurry of other Apple releases , some of them two-record sets also , in the case of Yoko Ono s Approximately Infinite Universe and the Beatles compilations 1962-1966 and 1967-1970 .
Despite such an output of product , the label was being wound down from this point on .
In Concert 1972 was the final Shankar-related release on Apple Records , following his Joi Bangla EP and Raga film soundtrack and the Concert for Bangladesh triple album , all issued in 1971 .
By the time In Concert 1972 was available in the UK , in April 1973 , Shankar , Harrison , Rakha and Khans sarod-playing son Aashish were working in Los Angeles on the Shankar Family & Friends album .
The latter , which would be a Dark Horse Records release , was remastered and reissued in 2010 as part of the Ravi Shankar-George Harrison , Collaborations box set , at the same time as Shankars East Meets West Music reissued the equally rare Raga documentary and soundtrack album .
In Concert 1972 was not included in these reissue projects , but it was released on CD as part of Apples 1996-97 repackaging campaign .
The 2004 two-CD version reunited the two halves of Raga Manj Khamaj .
Rough Guides world music guidebook lists In Concert 1972 among its very selective highlights of all Shankars releases , and writes of the live album : Pyrotechnics and profundity recorded in New York , matching sitar and sarod in Hindustani musics greatest jugalbandi .
In a piece written not long after the death of Ali Akbar Khan in June 2009 , MusicTraveler website described the album as absolutely mesmerising .
Some commentators have written that Khans sarod playing surpassed that of his father , Noting the reverence afforded Baba for his contributions to the genre , Rough Guide remarks on such comparisons : While it is considered unpardonable even to whisper it , many consider the more elevating player .
Reviewing the Apple CD in June 1997 , Ken Hunt enthused in Gramophone magazine : This is the living , fire-breathing embodiment of one of the greatest partnerships ever forged in Hindustani classical music .
Their sarod-sitar brotherhood had begun under their guru during the 1940s .
By the 1950s their combination of the robust , steel-clad sarod and the delicate sitar was highly acclaimed and in 1972 theirs was undoubtably the hottest ticket in Hindustani heaven ... Two musicians pouring their hearts out for their guru : that is the most succinct description of this sometimes smouldering , sometimes fiery , masterpiece .
Few Hindustani reissues - or new releases - will match its white-hot heat of creativity this year
A Meeting by the River is an album by Ry Cooder and Vishwa Mohan Bhatt , released in April 1993 through the record label Water Lily Acoustics .
Recorded in September 1992 , the improvised collaborative album features Cooder on slide guitar and Bhatt on the Mohan veena , a stringed instrument created by Bhatt .
A Meeting by the River was produced by Kavichandran Alexander and Jayant Shah , engineered by Alexander and mastered by Kevin Michael Gray and Paul Stubblebine .
The album peaked at number four on Billboard Top World Music Albums chart and earned Cooder and Bhatt Grammy Awards for Best World Music Album at the 36th Grammy Awards .
The album is included in Tom Moons 2008 book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die .
A Meeting by the River was recorded in September 1992 and features Cooder solely on slide guitar and Bhatt on the Mohan veena , a stringed instrument created by Bhatt .
Allmusic s Daniel Gioffre described the instrument as a hybrid between a guitar and a vichitra veena , performed with a metal slide moving across steel rods along the neck .
Cooder had heard a recording of Hindustani classical music performed by Bhatt and was impressed by his playing and the haunting clarity of the Mohan veena .
Cooder and Bhatt met for the first time less than one hour before recording began and improvised much of the set .
The album was produced by Kavichandran Alexander and Jayant Shah , engineered by Alexander and mastered by Kevin Michael Gray and Paul Stubblebine .
Cooder and Bhatt are accompanied by Cooders fourteen-year-old son Joachim on dumbek , a Middle Eastern drum , and Sukhvinder Singh Namdhari on tabla .
The collaboration between Cooder and Bhatt marked Alexanders first attempt to record musicians of different cultures together , one of his goals when he founded the record label .
Author George Plasketes described Bhatts playing as highly nuanced while Cooder performs in a more loose-jointed , slip n slide style .
According to Gioffre , Cooder and Bhatt use improvisation and voice-like phrasing , showing melodic performances in an alternating fashion and in unison .
The album contains four tracks , three of which were credited to Cooder and Bhatt , ranging in length from approximately seven and a half to twelve minutes .
Longing has a structure similar to a raga .
Author Tom Moon noted that Cooder takes the lead on the hymn Isa Lei as Bhatt contributes elaborate squiggling asides and swooping nosedives .
In 2011 , Bhatt performed A Meeting by the River at a music festival in honor of guru Kelucharan Mohapatra .
Bhatt said of the song : Music has no religion and no geographical or linguistic barrier .
It speaks a universal language .
My composition - A Meeting by the River - aims at explaining this .
Bhatt has stated that he considers working with Cooder his most special collaboration .
Gioffre wrote a positive review for the album and called Cooder and Bhatt genuine masters of their respective instruments .
He described the musical interplay between the musicians as nothing short of astounding and the album as a rare instance in which a combination of genres works .
Furthermore , Gioffre wrote : this album is masterfully recorded ; each instrument is clear , distinct , and three-dimensional sounding .
A Meeting by the River is a must-own , a thing of pure , unadulterated beauty , and the strongest record in Cooders extensive catalog .
Peter Margasak of the Chicago Tribune awarded the album four out of four stars , describing Cooders performance as arresting and Bhatts haunting .
Margasak wrote that the fusion revealed a rare , often transcendental beauty as the two artists gently and intuitively found common ground .
Rolling Stone called the album fruitful and awarded it three out of five stars .
A Meeting by the River reached a peak position of number four on Billboard Top World Music Albums chart .
In 1994 , the album earned Cooder and Bhatt Grammy Awards for Best World Music Album .
Bhatt became one of a few Indian musicians to have received a Grammy Award ; until A. R. Rahman won at the 52nd Grammy Awards in 2010 , previous Indian award winners had been recognized jointly with Western artists .
The February 25 , 1995 issue of Billboard , which featured the annual Indies Spotlight and covered independent music between the January 29 , 1994 and January 21 , 1995 issues of the magazine , included A Meeting by the River at number ten on its list of the Top Indie World Music Albums .
The album is included in Tom Moons 2008 book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die : A Listeners Life List .
All tracks by Ry Cooder and Vishwa Mohan Bhatt unless noted otherwise

Keherwa or Kaharva is one of the famous talas of Hindustani music .
It is also one of the common taals in North India , used in various popular compositions of Indian music .
Keherwa has many variations including dhumaali , bhajani , and qawwali .

Hillel Slovak was an Israeli-American musician best known as the original guitarist and founding member of the Los Angeles rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers .
Prior to his death of a heroin overdose in 1988 , Slovak recorded two albums with the band , Freaky Styley and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan .
His guitar work was primarily rooted in funk and hard rock , although he often experimented with other genres including reggae and speed metal .
He is considered to have been a major influence on the Red Hot Chili Peppers early sound .
Born in Haifa , Israel , Slovak immigrated with his family to the United States when he was five years old .
Slovak met future band mates Anthony Kiedis , Flea , and Jack Irons while attending school in Los Angeles .
He joined the group Anthym along with Irons while attending Fairfax High School ; Flea would later join the group , which later changed its name to What Is This ?

Slovak , Flea , Kiedis , and Irons started Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1983 , which became popular in the Los Angeles area , playing various shows around the city .
However , Slovak quit the band to focus on What is This ?
, which had gotten a record deal , leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers to record their debut album without him .
He rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1985 , and recorded the albums Freaky Styley and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan with the band .
During his career , Slovak developed a serious heroin addiction .
He attempted to quit the drug many times , but ultimately succumbed to his addiction , dying of an overdose on June 25 , 1988 at age 26 .
He was replaced by guitarist John Frusciante , who was greatly influenced by Slovaks playing style .
Several Red Hot Chili Peppers songs have been written as tributes to Slovak , including Knock Me Down and My Lovely Man .
In 1999 , his brother James Slovak published a book entitled Behind the Sun : The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak , which features Slovaks diaries and paintings .
Slovak was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on April 14 , 2012 , with his brother accepting on his behalf .
Hillel Slovak was born in Haifa , Israel , to Jewish parents who were survivors of the Holocaust .
His mother was of Polish descent and his father of Croatian descent .
The family emigrated to the U.S. when Slovak was five years old .
They settled in the Queens borough of New York City , then in 1967 relocated to Southern California .
As a child , Slovak developed an interest in art , and would often spend time painting with his mother , Esther .
He attended Laurel Elementary School in West Hollywood and Bancroft Jr. .
High School in Hollywood , where he met future bandmates Jack Irons and Michael Flea Balzary .
Slovak received his first guitar at age 13 as a bar mitzvah present , and would often play the instrument into the late hours of the night .
During this time , he was highly influenced by hard rock music such as Jimi Hendrix , Led Zeppelin , and Kiss .
As a freshman at Fairfax High School , Slovak formed a band with Irons on drums and two other high school friends , Alain Johannes and Todd Strassman .
They called their band Chain Reaction , then changed the name to What is This ?
after their first gig .
After one of the groups shows , Slovak met audience member Anthony Kiedis , and invited him to his house for a snack .
Kiedis later described the experience in his autobiography Scar Tissue : Within a few minutes of hanging out with Hillel , I sensed that he was absolutely different from most of the people Id spent time with ... He understood a lot about music , he was a great visual artist , and he had a sense of self and a calm about him that were just riveting .
Slovak , Kiedis and Flea became best friends and often used LSD , heroin , cocaine and methamphetamine recreationally .
Anthyms original bassist was deemed unsatisfactory , so Slovak began teaching Flea to play bass .
Following several months of commitment to the instrument , Flea developed proficiency and a strong musical chemistry with Slovak .
When Strassman saw Flea playing Anthym songs on his equipment he quit the band , with Flea quickly replacing him .
Shortly afterwards Anthym entered a local Battle of the Bands contest and won second place .
Anthym started to play at local nightclubs , despite the fact that the members were all underage .
After graduating from high school , the band changed their name to What Is This ?

Flea left Anthym around this time to accept an offer of playing bass in the prominent L.A. punk band Fear .
What Is This ?
continued on and performed many shows along the California coast .
Slovak , Kiedis , and Flea began to create their own music after finding inspiration in a punk-funk fusion band called Defunkt .
The three formed a band with former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons called Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem .
The band had only one song , entitled Out in L.A. , and was formed for the purpose of playing the song once .
The song was based on a guitar riff that Slovak wrote while jamming with Irons , and was not meant to become a real song until Kiedis decided to rap over the music .
Following the groups first show at The Rhythm Lounge , the owner of the bar asked them to return , but with two songs instead of one .
After several more shows , and the addition of several songs to their repertoire , the bands name was changed to Red Hot Chili Peppers .
After the band started to gain popularity amongst the L.A. club scene , Kiedis began writing more lyrics .
The lyrics would eventually become songs such as Green Heaven and True Men Dont Kill Coyotes , and the bands concert repertoire quickly grew to nine songs as a result of months of playing local nightclubs and bars .
Over the course of the next six months , the Red Hot Chili Peppers played many shows in L.A. clubs and became something of an underground hit .
Slovak , Kiedis , and Flea moved into a small house in a high-crime area in Hollywood where they collaborated musically and continued their drug addictions .
The threesome traveled to New York City to perform more shows and to spread Chili Pepperdom .
Shortly after the trip , Slovak moved out of the groups shared house to live with his girlfriend .
The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape and subsequently secured a record deal with EMI .
Flea left Fear to pursue the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
At the same time , What is This ?
had also gotten a record deal .
Since Slovak considered the Chili Peppers to merely be a side project and not a serious commitment , he left them to concentrate on What is This ?
Flea ultimately respected the decision , but felt the band would suffer musically without them .
He and Kiedis hired drummer Cliff Martinez and guitarist Jack Sherman to fill Irons and Slovaks places , respectively .
During the recording of the second What is This ?
album , Slovak became frustrated with the band and contacted Flea about rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
This came at an opportune time , as the group was dissatisfied with Slovaks replacement , Jack Sherman .
Kiedis felt that Shermans guitar work didnt have the same spirit that Slovak contributed to the bands sound .
When Flea asked Kiedis how he felt about Slovak rejoining the band , Kiedis responded by saying Id give my firstborn son to get him back in the band .
After the culmination of the promotional tour for their first album , Sherman was fired and Slovak rejoined the band .
Slovak returned to the Chili Peppers for their second album , Freaky Styley , which was released on August 16 , 1985 .
What is This ?
had finally disbanded , and Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid 1986 after Martinez was fired .
Flea , Slovak and Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and their relationships became strained .
Flea recalled that it began to seem ugly to me and not fun ; our communication was not healthy .
Kiedis became dependent on heroin , leaving the rest of the group to work on much of the albums material by themselves .
The band lived in Detroit for a portion of the recording of the album , where Kiedis and Slovak indulged in heavy cocaine use .
When Slovak was under the influence , he would often wear brightly colored clothing and dance in a shuffling fashion , which became the inspiration for the song Skinny Sweaty Man from the bands next album .
After Kiedis completed a stint in rehab , he rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan .
Slovak felt a deep connection to the album ; he reflected in his diary It was so fun .
Im so extremely proud of everybodys work - it is at times genius .
Slovak was the subject of the songs Skinny Sweaty Man , Me and My Friends , & No Chump Love Sucker .
He was nicknamed Slim Bob Billy , Slim , or Huckleberry , and throughout the albums Kiedis calls him by these nicknames before he starts a guitar solo .
On The Uplift Mofo Party Plan , Slovak experimented with different musical styles , playing the sitar on the song Behind the Sun .
Slovak and Kiedis became addicted to heroin early in their careers , and Slovak often attempted to conceal his addiction from his friends and family .
The band generally was more worried about Kiediss addiction , which was much more open and noticeable to the other members , while Slovak was much more subtle and much more cunning in his disguise .
During the tour in support of Freaky Styley , Slovaks health began to deteriorate .
Slovak and Flea would wrestle regularly on tour , but Slovak became too weak to participate .
Kiedis commented on the situation : I could tell that Hillel had no inner core of strength ; he had been robbed by his addiction of the life force that allows you to at least defend yourself .
It was a sad moment .
A roadie of the band who was concerned for Slovaks health contacted his brother , James , who had been unaware that Slovak had ever used heroin .
Deciding to give sobriety a chance , both Kiedis and Slovak stopped using drugs prior to their European tour in support of The Uplift Mofo Party Plan , and decided to help each other steer clear of heroin .
An entry from Slovaks diary on January 21 , 1988 discusses his attempts to begin a new drug-free phase of life .
During the tour both experienced intense heroin withdrawal , with Slovak much more unstable than Kiedis .
His withdrawal symptoms took a toll on his ability to play his instrument ; at one point Slovak had a mental breakdown and was unable to play a show , leaving the rest of the band to play an entire set with no guitar .
He recovered a few days later , but was briefly kicked out of the band and replaced by DeWayne McKnight for a few shows .
After a few days with McKnight , the band decided to give Slovak another chance , and he rejoined for the European leg of the tour .
Kiedis attempted to take Slovak to drug addiction counseling , but Slovak had difficulty admitting that his addiction was serious enough to require medical help .
Upon returning home , Slovak isolated himself from the rest of his bandmates , and struggled to resist the drug without the support of his friends , and Kiedis in particular .
He stopped painting and writing in his diary during this time , and little is known about his life the weeks following the tour , aside from a phone call to his brother on June 24 , in which Slovak told him that he was having difficulty staying clean despite his desire to stop taking heroin .
A few weeks after the band returned from the tour , the members attempted to contact Slovak , but were unable to for several days .
Slovak was found dead by police in his Hollywood apartment on June 27 , 1988 .
After his autopsy , authorities determined that he had died two days earlier due to a heroin overdose .
He is interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Hollywood Hills , California .
Following Slovaks death Kiedis fled town and did not attend the funeral , considering the situation to be surreal and dreamlike .
Although he found the death to be a shock , he initially was not scared straight and continued to use heroin .
However , a few weeks later his friend convinced him both to check into rehab and visit Slovaks grave , which inspired him to get clean for five years .
Irons was unable to cope with Slovaks death and subsequently quit the band , saying that he did not want to be part of something that resulted in the death of his friend .
Irons has suffered from severe depression since Slovaks death .
Kiedis and Flea decided to continue making music , hoping to continue what Slovak helped build .
Slovak was primarily influenced by hard rock artists such as Jimi Hendrix , Santana , and Led Zeppelin .
His playing method was highly based on improvisation , a style commonly used in funk music .
He also was noted for his aggressive playing style ; he would often play with such force that his fingers would come apart .
Kiedis observed that his playing evolved during his time away from the group in What is This ?
, with Slovak adopting a more fluid style featuring sultry elements as opposed to his original hard rock techniques .
On Uplift , Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including reggae and speed metal .
His guitar riffs would often serve as the basis of the groups songs , with the other members writing their parts to complement his guitar work .
His melodic riff featured in the song Behind the Sun inspired the group to create pretty songs with an emphasis on melody .
Kiedis describes the song as pure Hillel inspiration .
Slovak also used a talk box on songs such as Green Heaven and Funky Crime , in which the sounds of his amplified guitar would be played through a tube into his mouth and then back into a microphone , creating psychedelic voice-like effects .
Slovak helped to incorporate new sounds in the groups work , including adding occasional drum machines .
Despite the fact that the group billed itself as The Organic Anti-Beat Box Band , Kiedis states that Slovak showed the group that drum machines could be used as artistic instruments .
Slovaks work was one of the major contributing factors to the Red Hot Chili Peppers early sound .
When Kiedis and Flea were searching for a new guitarist to replace Slovak , Kiedis likened the experience to shopping for a new Mom and Dad because of his influence over the band .
Flea , who originally listened exclusively to jazz , added that Slovak introduced him to a new genre of music , saying that it was Hillel who first got me into hard rockin .
He was also a huge influence on a young John Frusciante , who would later replace him as guitarist in the band .
Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovaks work , and explained , I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillels playing and I just took it sideways from there .
Just like Slovak before him , Frusciante developed a heroin addiction .
Unlike Slovak , Frusciante eventually managed to break and defeat the habit .
The songs Knock Me Down and My Lovely Man were written as tributes to Slovak .
In 1999 , a book titled Behind the Sun : The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak was published .
The book was authored by Slovaks brother , James Slovak , and features writings from his brothers diaries , paintings , photos and hand written notes from Kiedis and Flea .
On December 7 , 2011 , the Red Hot Chili Peppers were announced as 2012 inductees to the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame .
In an interview with Rolling Stone , Kiedis expressed his excitement with Slovaks induction , explaining Hes a beautiful person that picked up a guitar in the 1970s and didnt make it out of the 1980s , and he is getting honored for his beauty .
Flea echoed those comments on the same day : Hillel grew up loving rock and roll so much , he has n't been here for some time , but I know how much it would mean to him .
It 's a powerful thing

Imrat Khan is a leading sitar and surbahar player .
He is the younger brother of sitar maestro Ustad Vilayat Khan .
Imrat was born in Calcutta into a family of musicians tracing its pedigree back for several generations , to the court musicians of the Mughal rulers .
His father was Enayat Khan , recognised as a leading sitar and surbahar player of his time , as had been his grandfather , Imdad Khan , before him .
His father died when Imrat was a child , so he was raised by his mother , Bashiran Begum and her father , singer Bande Hassan Khan .
In 1944 , the family moved with rising star Vilayat Khan , Imrats elder brother , to Bombay where both the brothers learned extensively from uncle Wahid Khan , Enayat Khans brother .
Wahid Khan was one of the greatest surbahar players of his generation and a top-level sitar player , and taught Imrat on the instruments in the family style , known as the Imdadkhani gharana , or Etawah Gharana , after a village outside Agra where Imdad Khan lived .
In 1952 Vilayat and Imrat moved in together in Calcutta .
They performed together for many years .
From the 1960s onwards , Imrat has performed and recorded solo , playing both sitar and surbahar .
For decades , Imrat has recorded extensively on both his instruments .
His full performance practice starts with a surbahar alap in dhrupad ang , followed by a shorter alap on the sitar leading into gat in traditional Imdadkhani style .

He has toured in Europe , the Americas , and East and Southeast Asia .
Surbahar players are rare today , and Imrat is the main living exponent .
Imrat has five sons , Nishat , Irshad , Wajahat and Shafaatullah , and Azmat Khan , now only eight ; the first four sons are all classical musicians : Nishat plays the sitar , Wajahat concentrates on the sarod and Shafaatullah is accomplished on sitar , tabla , and surbahar .
The surbahar tradition is largely upheld by Irshad , who has made some very traditional solo recordings .
Imrat Khan currently spends a portion of each year teaching classical Indian music and instructing sitar students at Washington University in Saint Louis .
In addition to his sons , Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones and George Harrison of The Beatles have been some of his famous students

Zamzama is an Arabic word meaning Thunder , or Roar .
As with many Arabic and Persian words , it has been taken into Urdu and is now considered indegenous to that language .
The meaning is : addition of notes .
Zamzama is a type of Alankara or Alankar -RRB- and part of the ornamentic in Indian Classical music , mainly for Raga performances - instrumental same as vocalistic .
Like a khatka , another type of Alankara , Zamzama is a cluster of notes , which is used by the musician to embellish the landing note .
The difference to a khatka is , that the notes in a Zamzama are rendered in progressive combinations and permutations .
For the listener it sounds like a complex taan pattern with sharp gamaks .
Zamzamas are an integral part of tappa singing and best applied herefore .
In Khayal renditions - a vocal style of North Indian Classics it must be applied with great caution by the vocalist
The Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav is an annual Indian Classical music festival held in Pune since 1953 .
Arguably the largest , most popular , and sought-after Indian Classical music festival in the world , the festival is hosted by the Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal and initiated by Pt .
Bhimsen Joshi as a memorial music conference commemorating the life and work of Pt .
Joshis guru , Pt .
Sawai Gandharva alias Rambhau Kundgolkar , the festivals namesake .
While Pt .
Joshi was leading the organization of the festival , performing artists received personal invitations from Pt .
Joshi to perform at the festival .
With an emphasis on Hidustani Classical Khayal music , instrumentalists , dancers , dhrupadiyas , Bhakti musicians , Ghazal musicians , Qawwaliyas , and Carnatic musicians frequent the concert lineup .
A younger artists debut performance at the festival connotes their arrival and promise to the Classical music scene of India .
Since its inception , the festival has grown into a prominent cultural soiree for Punes musical connoisseurs , featuring the foremost musicians of traditional Indian musical forms .
The festival was started in 1953 on a small scale , to commemorate the first death anniversary of Pt .
Sawai Gandharva , the acclaimed Hindustani Classical vocalist of the Kirana Gharana .
The festival played a key role in the development of Hindustani Classical music in Indias post-independence cultural history .
Prior to Indian Independence , Hindustani Classical musicians were supported by monarchs under patronage as court musicians since the beginning of the Mughal Empire .
After independence , the political division between India and Pakistan culturally alienated many Hindustani musicians .
The newfound Indian Republic resulted in an end to the patronage of musicians .
Classical musicians were forced to find new methods of sustaining themselves and their art .
Public performances of Classical musicians rose as a result , where the Sawai Gandharva Music Festival played an integral role in establishing a regional audience for Indian Classical music .
Within the first several decades following Indian Independence , a great number of music festivals or music conferences were founded in order to provide a platform for Classical musicians to perform .
Pt .
Bhimsen Joshi was leading the organization of the festival since its beginning until 2002 when his health problems became of concern .
Following , Pt .
Joshis youngest son , Shrinivas Joshi , and senior disciple , Shrikant Deshpande , succeeded Pt .
Joshi in organizing the music conference .
Since Bhimsen Joshi s death in 2011 , Shrinivas Joshi and Anand Deshmukh have been leading organizers of the music conference .
The festival was initiated specifically to showcase performers of the Kirana Gharana and started on a small scale .
Gharana-specific music festivals were popular at the time because musicians wanted to commercialize their Gharana style and artists .
Pt .
Bhimsen Joshi was instrumental in inviting musicians from varying backgrounds to the festival because of his own appreciation and reverence for diverse approaches to presenting Indian Classical music .
By the late 1970s , the festival established itself as a festival that had the fullest representation of the Classical music temperament in India .
As a result , the festival has become an annual event for music connoisseurs worldwide and reinforces the modernity of Indian Classical Music .
The 2009 Festival was postponed to January 2010 due to an H1N1 scare in Pune .
This was the first instance in festival history of any kind of postponement .
Recently , many festival regulars have criticized the festivals growing commercial success for causing a decrease in musical quality .
Many attribute this to Pt .
Bhimsen Joshis retirement from organizing the festival after 2002 .
At the 59th festival in 2011 , the performances of senior musicians like Utd .
Amjad Ali Khan and Dr. Prabha Atre were interrupted due to time restrictions , angering audiences .
Many have also criticized the ASPM for inviting fewer musicians of less popularity to perform .
The ASPM has also been criticized for not publicly releasing vintage recordings of past festival performances .
After Pt .
Bhimsen Joshis death in January 2011 , the Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal decided to rename the festival Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav in honor of the legendary vocalist .
The Sawai Gandharva Music Festival is conducted every year in the first two weeks of December over three days .
In the past , the festival runs through whole the night and the days used to end in the morning .
Later on , when Pune Municipal Corporation set rule to finish the program before 10pm which leads to change in the schedule of the program .
Traditionally , each festival is inaugurated with a tribute honoring Pt .
Sawai Gandharva , with a Shehnai musician performing first , in the early morning .
During the first two days , programs begin in the late-afternoon and are supposed to officially end by 10 p.m. On the third and final day , the programme is conducted in two sessions , the first beginning in the early morning continuing until the early afternoon , the second session begins in the early evening and ends at 10 p.m. .
It has been tradition that the last , finale performance is presented by Pt .
Bhimsen Joshi .
Since Pt .
Joshis retirement in 2004 , other members of the Kirana Gharana have concluded the festival , including Pt .
Sangmeshwar Gurav in 2005 , leading disciples of Pt .
Bhimsen Joshi in 2006 .
Doyen of Kirana Gharana , eminent vocalist Dr. Prabha Atre has concluded every festival since 2007 .
The festival officially concludes with the entire audience and remaining performers listening to the Thumri in Raag Bhairavi recording Jamuna Ke Teer by Sawai Gandharva , a tune made famous by and signature of his guru , Utd .
Abdul Karim Khan .
The Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal takes the task of recording details of the festival each year .

A master percussionist , Bose plays several other drums besides the tabla which include the sri-khole , the pakhwaj , the dholak , the nal , and the banga-kanga .
However , it is the unusual way that he plays the bnaya that has brought him attention .

From the Benaras Gharana , he has played with Girija Devi , Rajan and Sajan Mishra , Kanthe Maharaj , and Kishan Maharaj .
While he has collaborated with leaders in jazz , pop and rock , it was his duet with Iranian thumba player Professor Semurani that drew praise .
Boses collaborations have given an international reputation as a great musician .
Of the six established tabla gharanas or schools of tabla playing , the Benares Gharana , of which Bose belongs , has been the most staunch in its refusal to compromise the traditions when moving into more lucrative contemporary fusions .
While criticized decades ago for his rigidity and refusal to adapt modern fusion and film music , Bose is now credited with preserving classical musical style and philosophy .
He has kept the tradition of the Benares Gharana by subtly balancing the warm bass tones of the bayan with the higher-pitched crisp tones and syncopations of the dayan .
Many of Boses compositions have been written to accompany the rhythmical movements of kathak dancers and are a specialty of the Benares tradition .
Bose currently conducts private lessons in the style of his mentors .
He conducts classes daily with students from age 3 to 35 at his home in North Calcutta .
He is known for maintaining high standards for his students , emphasizing the importance devoted practice and other aspects of the tradition .
His high profile students also includes the likes of the Mumbai-based tabla player Shyama Prasad Das .
Bose has produced or performed on over 200 recordings in several genres , while staying true to his classical Indian lineage .
The first live international recording of his solo Virtuosity was released through the Darbar Festival 2006 in London .
The album includes some rare gems from the archives of the Benares repertoire , including the compositions of Ram Sahai , who founded the gharana at the beginning of the nineteenth century .
Toward the end of the album , Bose demonstrates one of his specialities : playing a variety of cross rhythms on the dayan with his right hand while simultaneously holding down a fast repetitive beat on the bnaya with his left hand .
The Times reviewed the performance , declaring him the best tabla player in the world today .
Kumar Bose is married to Kaberi Bose , a classical singer and they have a daughter Trisha Bose , a vocalist

During 1960s , another turn came in natya sangeet with the emergence of Jitendra Abhisheki , who was credited with applying simplicity to the complex composition of Natya Sangeet
Mogubai Kurdikar was a renowned Hindustani classical music vocalist of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana .
Mogu Kurdikar was born in a Gomantak Maratha Samaj community in the village of Kurdi in the then Portuguese Goa .
When she was ten years old , her mother , Jayashreebai , took her to the temple at Zambavli , and arranged for a wandering holyman to teach music to Mogu for a while .
Later she took Mogu to a traveling theater company , the Chandreshwar Bhootnath Sangeet Mandali , and the company took Mogu in as an actress .
While Mogu was with Chandreshwar Bhootnath Mandali , her mother died .
A legend says that on her deathbed the mother told Mogu that her soul would not rest in peace until Mogu became a famous singer .
The theater company soon went bankrupt , and the rival Satarkar Stree Sangeet Mandali hired Mogu .
She played commendably the parts such as of Kinkini in the play , Punyaprabhav , and of the heroine Subhadra in the play with the same name , Subhadra .
A conflict arose , however , between Mogu and one of the senior women in the theater company , who then expelled Mogu from the company .
Mogu moved to Sangli , and took some music lessons from Inayat Khan of the Rampur-Sahaswan gharana .
For some reason , however , he too soon decided to terminate giving her further lessons .
At this time , vocalist legend Gaansamrat Alladiya Khan Saheb was in Sangli for medical treatment , and on his way to and from his doctors , he walked by Mogus residence , where he would hear her practice what she had learnt from Inayat Khan .
One day he stopped , introduced himself and offered to teach her .
Young Mogu of course agreed , but despite Alladiyas fame , she had not heard of him - it was not until some time later , when she observed dignitaries bow down to him , that she fully realised his standing .
After some eighteen months , Alladiya Khan moved to Bombay , and Mogu followed .
Thus begun a time of intrigue in Bombays high-society and classical music circles .
For Alladiya was supported in Bombay by wealthy patrons in exchange for music teaching , and they would not let him take other students .
In desperation , Mogu turned to Bashir Khan of the Agra gharana , who agreed to teach her if she would perform the formal gandha-bandan ceremony of guru-shishya discipleship with fellow Agra ustad Vilayat Hussein Khan .
This came to happen , and Alladiya heard of it .
He demanded that she stop the discipleship and instead go to his brother , Hyder Khan .
But as the Agra ustads had a lot of clout , Mogu hesitated , and solicited a promise that Alladiya would teach her himself in the future if Hyder ever failed to do so .
A deal was worked out , Hyder taught her for a while , but Alladiyas rich and powerful students were putting a lot of pressure on him to put a stop to it , increasingly jealous of her progress .
About 1930 , Alladiya felt forced to persuade his brother to stop teaching and leave town , but came clean to the heartbroken Mogu about what had happened , essentially breaking his promise .
At this stage in her career , Mogu could likely have supported herself as a performer .
But she chose not to .
Not content with the prospect of being just another name on the scene , she wanted to become the best , the foremost representative of a tradition .
She gave birth to a daughter , Kishori , and kept practicing on her own , until one day Alladiya came back to her .
They performed the gandha-bandan , and he now kept teaching her to the end of his life .
She became one of the topmost singers in North India , even hailed as the queen by Alladiya in public .
She received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1968 and the Sangeet Research Academy Award in 1980 , and was decorated with the Padma Bhushan , Indias third highest civilian honour for service to the nation , in 1974 .
Mogubai trained students such as Kaushalya Manjeshwar , Padma Talwalkar , Kamal Tambe , Wamanrao Deshpande , Suhasini Mulgaonkar , Babanrao Haldankar , Arun Dravid , and her own daughter , Kishori Amonkar Some of Mogubais recordings have been reissued as a volume of RPG Musics Vintage 78 RPM Recordings on CD series .
This was at a time when it was difficult for classical musicians , in however high esteem , to support themselves .
The subcontinents many royal courts had supported the music for centuries , but there was no large middle class and no widespread public appreciation ; now the courts were on the remove , and the budding recording industry did not have anything like todays large commercial base

Anupam Shobhakar , born Anupam Shovakar , is an Indian musician , composer , instrumentalist , record producer , and classically trained sarodist currently living in Brooklyn , New York .
He has released three World Fusion albums , and one classical Indian music album .
He has performed live around the world at various venues and for charitable causes .
Shobhakars track Water made it to the first round of the Grammy Awards .
Shobhakar was born in the east Indian state of Kolkata , but was raised in Indias financial capital city of Bombay .
Although Shobhakars parents are not musicians , they often played classical Indian records at home , which had an influence on Shobhakar .
His grandfather , Shri Bhavani Shankar Shovakar , played sitar , tabla , and sang , hosting concerts at his residence .
Shobhakars first brush with Western Music was listening to Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple , followed by Megadeth and Metallica .
He was given a guitar , which he strung lefty , and began practicing , eventually forming a band named Dead Sea Scrolls , which played Megadeth , Joe Satriani , and Steve Vai covers .
During this same time , Shobhakar began experimenting with Jazz and Western Classical Music .
In his early teens , Shobhakar began to listen to Indian Classical Music again -- as he says , What I was doing on the guitar was not enough to musically satisfy me .
I heard a Shakti record ... that re-ignited my interest in the deep melodic gravitas .
Shobhakar experimented by crafting a fretless guitar , but found that nothing could match the microtonal subtleties of Indian Music like the traditional Sarode .
Shobhakar met Ustad Aashish Khan briefly when he came to do a concert in Bombay and stayed at Shobhakars apartment .
Shobhakar states that he was blown away by Khans command over the Sarode , and has been studying with him ever since .
Shobhakar lists Khan , and his father , Ustad Allaudin Khan , as his main playing style influences : Slightly aggressive in approach , but never at the cost of the melodic charm .
Shobhakar was recognized for his talents as an Indian Classical Music performer by the Priyadarshni Academy , who awarded him the Best Young Artist Award .
Shobhakars current focus is World Fusion and Jazz Fusion .
Shobhakar recorded his first album Mysterious Awakening , in 2004 .
He handled every aspect of production on the record , including tracking the guitars with a goose neck internet chat mic .
Shobhakar describes the sound of the music on the album as the best of both worlds .
He explains , Most Indian musicians do not understand harmony as its not a part of the musical system -- its a melodic and rhythmic tradition -- whereas a lot of western music is based on harmony .
The album was released by Saregama HMV .
Shobhakars album was his first major contribution to the World Fusion genre , something Shobhakar feels very passionately about .
He says , Apart from being a traditional concert sarodist , I want to really explore world music , and Ive been wanting to do that for a while .
Ive been pretty much producing on my own : making all the music , adding all the MIDI instrumentation in my studio at home .
But here its better , because I can meet a lot of different musicians , a lot of different , diverse people .
Shobhakar has released a subsequent World Fusion album , Wine of the Mystic in 2005 , and is finishing production on another , titled Way of the Warrior .
In 2009 , he released an Indian Classical album , Dream Theory .
Shobhakar is currently working on a new project , The Joel Harrison - Anupam Shobhakar Quintet .
Shobhakar has toured internationally , playing at major music festivals such as Canadas Vancouver Folk Festival , MTVs Independence Rock Festival in India , Omans Muscat Festival , and Italys Roma Rock .
Shobhakar has also dedicated his talents to charitable events such as YWCA Indias Concert for Peace , raising money for the survivors of the Gujarat earthquake .

In Hindustani music , a pakad is a generally-accepted musical phrase thought to encapsulate the essence of a particular raga .
The pakad contains the melodic theme of the raga , on listening to the pakad a person who knows the raga is usually able to identify it .
In many cases , the ragas contain the same swaras , then the pakad also contains information about gayaki or chalan .
Usually , the pakad is formed from short convolutions of the arohana and avarohana , while in some cases it is quite different from them .
The pakad for a particular raga need not be unique , its sole purpose is to clarify what raga it is .
For example , here is a pakad for raga Yaman , a prominent raga from Hindustani Music :
While the sitar had earlier been used in jazz and Indian film music , it was from the 1960s onwards that various pop artists in the Western world began to experiment with incorporating the sitar , a classical Indian stringed instrument , within their compositions .
The first known use of the sitar in a rock music recording session was made by the Yardbirds when they hired a sitar player to play the main riff for their single Heart Full of Soul .
However , the version with the sitar riff was not released at the time and George Harrison is now recognised as having introduced the instrument to pop music .
During a break in the filming of The Beatles second movie , Help !
, Harrison picked up a sitar left on the set as a prop and attempted to play it .
His initial interest eventually led to his taking lessons from Pandit Ravi Shankar and Shambhu Das .
He subsequently played the instrument on the Beatles song Norwegian Wood on the LP Rubber Soul in 1965 , which became the first released Western pop song to feature the sitar .
George Harrison went on to play the tamboura , a long-necked plucked lute , on both Revolver and Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band , as well as laying down sitar tracks for both albums on the songs Love You To , Tomorrow Never Knows , and Within You Without You .
A later Beatles song , Across the Universe , also featured the sitar .
Additionally , Harrison made great use of the sitar on his first solo album , 1968s Wonderwall Music .
In early 1966 , Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones played the sitar on Paint It , Black , having taught himself to play after visiting his friend George Harrison .
Jones also played sitar on some tracks of Between the Buttons and Their Satanic Majesties Request .
In early October 1967 , he again played sitar on My Little One in a recording session with Jimi Hendrix as well as the tambura on Street Fighting Man .
A fad for sitars in pop songs soon developed , facilitated by the Danelectro Companys 1967 introduction of the first electric sitar , known as the Coral Electric Sitar .
This instrument was an electric guitar with a distinctive sitar-like sound , rather than an acoustic sitar of the type traditionally made in India .
Despite producing similar sounds , the two instruments are completely different .
As the electric sitar was much easier to play than the traditional version it quickly became the preferred choice of most rock musicians .
The Coral instrument was an inexpensive item for its time and production only continued for a few years , making them relatively rare and expensive instruments today .
The late 1960s saw the release of songs featuring the sitar that included The Monkees This Just Doesnt Seem To Be My Day , Ricky Nelson s Marshmallow Skies , Scott McKenzie s San Francisco , The Cyrkle s Turn-Down Day , The Cowsills The Rain , the Park , and Other Things , John Fred and His Playboy Bands Judy in Disguise , The Turtles Sound Asleep , The Chocolate Watch Band s In the Past , The Box Tops Cry Like a Baby , The Lemon Pipers Green Tambourine , Traffic s Paper Sun and Hole In My Shoe Tomorrow Real Life Permanent Dream , July The Way and The Kinks Fancy .
Elvis Presley had several recordings that prominently featured the electric sitar .
These included a 1967 cover of Tommy Tucker s R&B ; classic Hi-Heel Sneakers , Mort Shuman s Youll Think Of Me , , Percy Mayfield s Stranger In My Own Home Town and a cover of the Anne Murray country classic , Snowbird .
In the instances of Hi-Heel Sneakers and Snowbird , Nashville , Tennessee session musician Harold Bradley played the electric sitar .
For Youll Think Of Me and Stranger In My Own Home Town , highly regarded Memphis , Tennessee and Nashville , Tennessee session musician Reggie Young played the electric sitar .
The Mamas & The Papas used the sitar on various tracks such as People Like Us , Snowqueen Of Texas , Lady Genevieve , I Wan na Be a Star and Grasshopper , and Sergio Mendes & Brazil 66 used it on `` Chove Chuva '' .
Eric Burdon and the Animals played the instrument in the songs Winds of Change , No Self Pity , Orange and Red Beams , All Is One , We Love You Lil , and Monterey .
The Strawberry Alarm Clock use the sitar in songs such as An Angry Young Man , Black Butter-Present and Sit with the Guru .
Although often overlooked , some of the most extensive users of the instrument in contemporary music were Mike Heron and Robin Williamson of The Incredible String Band , combining folk , psychedelia with eastern influences in the songs The Song Has no ending parts 1-9 , The Mad Hatters Song and The Iron Stone .
Steve Miller Band used sitar in their popular song Wild Mountain Honey .
Art-Rock bands such as The Moody Blues used the sitar on a few albums and particularly on In Search of the Lost Chord while the The Pretty Things album S.F. Sorrow also featured the instrument on a few tracks , as did Procol Harum s epic song In Held Twas In I on the segment Glimpses of Nirvana .
Jethro Tull used the sitar on Fat Man and Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day .
The Strawbs used it on many recordings while Genesis used the electric sitar on their song I Know What I Like from their fifth album Selling England by the Pound .
Steve Howe of Yes used an electric sitar on the bands album Close to the Edge , and the band Family used the instrument in the song Face In The Cloud , recorded on their 1969 album Family Entertainment .
Donovan s hit song Hurdy Gurdy Man used a tamboura , which can also be heard on songs such as Sunny South Kensington , Breezes of Patchouli , Celeste , Guinevere , Three King Fishers , Ferris Wheel , and Fat Angel .
Richie Havens made extensive use of the sitar in the title song of his second album , Something Else Again .
Blue Cheer used both sitar and tabla in their song , Babji .
Although the sitar craze had died down by 1970 , its distinctive sound had become an indelible part of pop music .
Tom Petty and Mike Campbell used a guitar fitted with a harpsichord-device to simulate a sitar for their hit Dont Come Around Here No More while John Renbourn used the instrument prominently during his time with the folk band Pentangle , on songs such as Once I Had a Sweetheart , House Carpenter , Cruel Sister , Rain And Snow and The Snows .
Roy Wood from The Move played sitar on Night of Fear using the same riffs as Tchaikovsky s 1812 Overture , as well as the electric sitar on Open up said the world at the door .
Moreover , the Dutch band Shocking Blue used the sitar in many of their songs , most prominently in Love Buzz , Acka Raga , Water Boy , Hot Sand , and Im A Woman .
In 1987 George Harrison returned to the sitar in his nostalgic Beatles tribute , When We Was Fab for the album Cloud Nine
Ashwin Kumar Batish Hindi : ashvin kumaar baatish is a sitar and tabla player best known for rekindling interest in the sitar among young Indians .
A child prodigy , Ashwin would often sing with his sister Meena Batish at performances organized by his father , the composer , author , Bollywood playback singer and music director , Pandit Shiv Dayal Batish .
His mother , Shrimati Shanta Devi Batish , was an All India Radio artist and is credited for starting young Ashwin on the dholak drum around the age of seven and on the sitar around the age of 12 .
When Ashwins father took him to see his friend Ashok , the son of the great music director and harmonium wizard Pandit Bhagatram , Ashwin fell in love with the sitar .
Ashok was only 2 years older than Ashwin and seeing his friend perform made Ashwin think that he could too .
In 1964 , Ashwins father left India to visit one of his daughters in England .
Ashwin turned to his mother and shared with her his secret wish to play the sitar .
She bought him a student model sitar and started teaching him herself , as she had played the sitar when young .
His mother had also presented him with some sitar albums by Ravi Shankar .
Ashwin would listen and copy all the songs to the best of his abilities .
At the same time , he was also a great fan of the Beatles , Cliff Richards , Pat Boone and other pop singers of the 50s era .
Ashwin wasted no time in whipping out the songs he heard from these Western artists .
It was when Ashwin joined his father in England at around age 14 that he started receiving training from him on the intricacies of North Indian classical music .
Ashwin also started learning compositions in various ragas .
His father would often sing and have Ashwin copy the musical phrases .
He also taught Ashwin many songs based in various ragas he had studied with his Guruji Shri Chandan Ram Charan .
By age 16 , Ashwin had started to accompany his father on various programs .
He also started getting calls to play for college nights for which a local tabla player would accompany him .
One such memorable event was when he performed for an OXFAM benefit in England .
Soloing in front of a live audience , without his father by his side , made Ashwin realize how much more he needed to learn , and he became an earnest disciple of his father .
Ashwin was put on a rigorous practice schedule .
The cold English weather meant that there was only one warm room in the house where all his family would gather .
To Ashwins advantage and delight , his father would always give his playing the preference to the dismay of Ashwins brothers and sisters .
While his siblings strained to enjoy the British movies and serials on the TV , Ashwin started to show improvement in his playing .
On one such day , Ashwin was practicing .
When he stopped playing , there was silence in the room .
All his family members were looking at him and he saw his siblings nodding and showing appreciation at what he had just played .
Ashwin learnt from this experience and started to tune into this new sense of expressive musical attraction .
He fine-tuned this ability in his live performances .
At 20 , Ashwin found himself working full-time for a group of Chartered Accountants as an apprentice popularly known as an articled clerk .
When he turned up at the job in long hair and jeans , he was promptly pulled aside by his employers and given a lecture on attire .
While Ashwin ignored these admonishments from his bosses and fellow clerks , despite threats of being given menial tasks if he did not comply , Ashwin was finding that being part of the workforce was in complete contrast to his lifestyle as a performer .
Ashwin is presently teaching Indian music at his music school in Santa Cruz , California .
Ashwin was one of the pioneers on the World Wide Web credited with some of the very first Indian music-related websites which he ran on the Gopher platform via the early University of California , Santa Cruz system .
He also publishes an online magazine that is mostly educational in nature called RagaNet .
It provides regular lessons on sitar , tabla , Dilruba , History of India music , etc. .
Articles on musical instruments of India are also a regular feature .
Although his training has been in North Indian classical music , Ashwin Batish has been equally at home with Western music often performing with jazz and rock musicians .
His 80s fling with fusion music he self-titled Sitar Power was instrumental in garnering him serious airplay including a recording contract with Shanachie Records of New Jersey .
He did not last long at Shanachie due to disappointing sales reports and lack of support .
Ashwin soon formed his own record label , Batish Records to publish all his familys works .
Ashwin continues to be active in the field of Indian music and is currently teaching at the Batish Institute of Indian Music and Fine Arts in Santa Cruz , California , USA .
His fathers death in the year 2006 dealt a severe blow to Ashwins energies and after a long period of inactivity Ashwin has found a new direction .
In remembrance and as a dedication to his fathers memory and contribution to the music world , Ashwin has embarked upon a very special venture into broadcasting .
This has given a voice to over 50 years of archived audio and video content .
Radio Ragmala Radio and Television streams Batish related audio and video content 24/7 providing a glimpse into the rich musical heritage of the Batish family .
It is also intended to be highly educational in nature thus fulfilling the intent of Ashwins father to help spread this wealth of musical knowledge to the rest of the world .
Ashwin has been actively spreading his brand of classical and fusion music by creating portals on social networks such as Myspace and Facebook .

Vincent McDermott is a classically trained American composer and ethnomusicologist .
His works show particular influence from the musics of South and Southeast Asia , particularly the gamelan music of Java .
He is among the second generation of American composers to create and promote new compositions for gamelan .
He received a B.F.A. in music composition from the University of Pennsylvania , an M.A. in music history from the University of California , Berkeley , and a Ph.D. in music history , theory , and composition from the University of Pennsylvania .
His composition instructors included Constant Vauclain , George Rochberg , Darius Milhaud , and Karlheinz Stockhausen .
In 1980 , McDermott became friends with Lou Harrison , the godfather of American gamelan .
It was Harrison who encouraged McDermott to start composing for gamelan .
McDermott first encountered gamelan c. 1965 in Amsterdam .
He later studied Javanese gamelan in Indonesia at the Akademi Seni Karawitan Indonesia in Central Java .
He has studied or worked in Surakarta with Sumarsam and Rahayu Supanggah , and later , in the United States , with Pak Cokro and Midiyanto .

His musical styles have swayed in different directions .
His generation witnessed the onset of a wealth of new styles , and in his early days he tried his hand at many of them .
By and by he eschewed the poles of abstract atonality and indeterminacy that were much in favor in the 1960s and 1970s .
Instead he turned increasingly to modality , melody , and counterpoint , which styles have continued since .
His compositional goals are expressivity , depth , and spirituality , yet often with a light heart .
In Asia , he advises young composers to borrow what they can from western traditions , saying it will help them speak to international audiences .
But he insists the soul of their music as well as many of its techniques must come from their own soil .

Radhika Mohan Maitra was an Indian sarod player .
Maitra was considered an influential figure in 20th century sarod playing and received the title Sangeetacharya .
Radhika Mohan Maitra was born 1917 in Calcutta to a prominent family of the erstwhile feudal aristocracy of East Bengal , and grew up in Rajshahi , where his family had vast estates .
His grandfather Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra was a pakhawaj player and had in his employ , the renowned sarod player Mohammad Amir Khan , with whom Radhika Mohan studied for five to six years .
According to Maitras private accounts given to his student Kalyan Mukherjea , this training initially adhered to a basic corpus of about 20 ragas for the first four years , but as the Ustad began to realize that his time was running out , he taught Radhika Mohan as many as three to four ragas in a day , in sessions lasting all day .
Radhubabu later studied dhrupad with the famous beenkar Dabir Khan and sitar with Enayat Khan .
Maitras debut concert was in Calcutta , in the home of another aristocratic family , the Gangulys , who were also patrons of music .
Two of the Ganguly brothers , Shyam and Hirendra Kumar became renowned sarod and tabla players , respectively .
This was followed by an appearance at the Allahabad Music Conference in 1937 , where he won the first prize in the instrumental music contest and was invited to perform alongside stalwarts such as Hafiz Ali Khan and Allauddin Khan .
It was at this same conference that he gave a duet concert with Allauddin Khan at the latters invitation .
He rose to great heights as a performer and from about 1940 until the mid-60s , no major musical event in India was complete without his participation .
Maitra was a prolific composer and perhaps the only keen student of sarod technique in his era .
He not only archived hundreds of traditional compositions in voluminous ledgers that he maintained , but also devised a very efficient method of imparting sarod technique , repertoire and what he considered good musical taste , to his students .
Radhubabu was considered a formidable authority on the theoretical aspects of raga music , which he took great pains to translate accurately into his own music and that of his students .
After 1970 , Maitras technical form , which he was so renowned for , began to decline steeply , as he was struck by one personal tragedy after another .
In 1976 , he announced his retirement from the concert stage and returned to perform only twice after , once in 1980 and then in 1981 .
In October 1981 , Maitra died of brain hemorrhage as a result of an accident in his south Calcutta home .
As a teacher , Radhika Mohan Maitra had very few equals .
Some of his students include sitarist Nikhil Banerjee , sarod players Buddhadev Dasgupta , Nemai Chand Dhar , Anil Roychowdhury , Samarendranath Sikdar , Kalyan Mukherjea , Narendranath Dhar , Joydeep Ghosh , sitarists Himadri Bhushan Bagchi , Sanjoy Bandopadhyay and Sugato Nag .
Of his students , Kalyan Mukherjea and Samarendra Sikdar are the closest to his personal sound and style .
Radhubabu was temperamentally and culturally unlike the professional musicians of his time .
He belonged to the erstwhile patron class and had organized and financed many large-scale music conferences , and even when , after the partition of India in 1947 , he had to leave his ancestral lands in Rajshahi and come to Calcutta , was not able abandon his aristocratic temperament in favour of the professional mindset .
As a result , he was never a commercially successful musician .
Radhika Mohan Maitra was also exceptionally well-educated for an Indian musician of his era .
He had a masters degree in Philosophy , and trained as a lawyer .
In fact , Maitra took to law as his profession , and was a failure in this endeavour , before allowing music to become his livelihood

The rudra veena is a large plucked string instrument used in Hindustani classical music , one of the major types of veena played in Indian classical music .
It has a long tubular body made of wood or bamboo with a length between 54 and 62 inches .
Two large-sized , round resonators , made of dried and hollowed gourds , are attached under the tube .
Twenty-four brass-fitted raised wooden frets are fixed on the tube with the help of wax .
There are 4 main strings and 3 chikari strings .
As Rudra is a name for the Hindu god Shiva , rudra vina literally means the veena dear to Shiva .
It is an ancient instrument rarely played today .
The rudra veena declined in popularity in part due to the introduction in the early 19th century of the surbahar , which allowed sitarists to more easily present the alap sections of slow dhrupad - style ragas .
In 20th century , Zia Mohiuddin Dagar modified and redesigned the rudra veena to use bigger gourds , a thicker tube , thicker steel playing strings and closed javari that .
This produced a soft and deep sound when plucked without the use of any plectrum .
The instrument was further modified as the shruti veena by Lalmani Misra to establish Bharats Shadja Gram and obtain the 22 shrutis

Two apocryphal incidents in his childhood are believed to have influenced Ghosh in taking up the flute .

The family 's ancestral house was on the banks of the Kirtankhola river .
At the age of nine , while swimming in the river one day , Ghosh found a long bamboo stick that was half-flute and half walking stick .
The flute part of the stick was longer than a traditional flute and Ghosh started practising on it .
Then at the age of eleven , Ghosh is said to have met a holy man who held a conch and a flute and asked if he could play the flute .
When Ghosh obliged , the man blessed him and said that music would be his salvation .
He was married to Parul Ghosh in 1924 when she was only nine and he was thirteen years old .
She was the younger sister of Ghosh 's friend Anil Biswas who went on to become a celebrated music composer .
Parul was a talented singer herself and later became a well-known playback singer .
In 1928 , Ghosh became a part of the Indian Independence Movement .
He joined a gymnasium and learnt martial arts , boxing and stick fighting .
As he became more involved in the independence movement , the government started keeping a close watch .
Consequently he shifted to Calcutta at the age of seventeen in search of a livelihood .
At the age of eighteen , he started focusing his attention on the flute .
Ghosh realised that a bigger flutes pitch and sonority would be more appropriate for both classical and light music .
Ghosh experimented with various materials including metal and different types of wood , and decided on using bamboo .
He finally settled on a flute which was thirty two inches long .

Tana Mana is an album by Indian musician Ravi Shankar , originally credited to the Ravi Shankar Project and released in 1987 .
The album is an experimental work by Shankar , mixing traditional instrumentation with 1980s electronic music and sampling technology .
Shankar recorded much of Tana Mana in 1983 with sound effects innovator Frank Serafine , but it remained unreleased until Peter Baumann , head of new age record label Private Music , became attached to the project .
The album title translates to mean body and mind .
In addition to his familiar instrument , the sitar , Shankar plays synthesizer extensively on the recording .
The album also includes contributions from Lakshmi Shankar , Aashish Khan and Kumar Bose , and Western musicians such as George Harrison , Al Kooper and Ray Cooper .
In his 1997 autobiography , Raga Mala , Ravi Shankar writes that he started work on Tana Mana in 1983 at the home studio of Frank Serafine , a sound effects designer for Hollywood films such as Tron .
The album began as an experiment by Shankar with the innovative sampling technology that Serafine had assembled at his studio - Serafine FX in Venice , western Los Angeles .
Shankar recalls recording two or three pieces on synthesizer before having to depart for India .
On his return to Los Angeles , Shankar overdubbed contributions from regular accompanists such as his son Shubho and sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar , and from sarodya Aashish Khan and tabla player Swapan Chaudhuri .
Up to five new pieces were also recorded at this time , according to Shankars recollection .
The experimental nature of the project impressed Shankars circle of friends in California , he writes in Raga Mala , but confused record companies , who were unable to attribute the music to a recognised genre .
The recordings were left sitting there waiting for someone to show more interest , Shankar recalls , until the involvement of German composer Peter Baumann , who had formed a label specialising in experimental music , Private Music , in 1984 .
According to the credits listed in Shankars 1995 box set In Celebration , further recording for what became Tana Mana took place during 1986 .
One of the additional tracks was Friar Park , featuring Shankars friend and sometime collaborator George Harrison .
Named after Harrisons estate in Oxfordshire , west of London , the song was based on Raga Charukeshi and features Shankar playing both standard and bass sitars .
Shankar and Harrison taped the track at FPSHOT , Harrisons home studio , accompanied by Ray Cooper on marimba and Markandeya Mishra , a local tabla player .
Another 1986 recording was West Eats Meat , its title suggested by Serafine as a pun on Shankars earlier cross-cultural projects , such as West Meets East , his trilogy of albums with classical violinist Yehudi Menuhin .
Shankar describes the session for West Eats Meat as the first time he ever played sitar with a jazz bassist - in this instance , Patrick OHearn .
Produced by Baumann at The Enterprise in Burbank , California , the session included contributions from Lakshmi , Khan and former Shankar student Harihar Rao , and tabla player Kumar Bose .
Like Chaudhuri , Bose had become one of Shankars preferred accompanists on tabla , following the end of of the sitarists 33-year partnership with Alla Rakha in 1985 .
Other Western musicians who contributed to the album include Al Kooper , on electric guitar , and Ric Parnell , playing electronic drums .
In both his autobiography and the comments included with In Celebration , Shankar refers to Tana Mana as having been an enjoyable album to make .
The title track was one of my favourite numbers , he writes - a musical tribute to his mother , who died in 1936 while Shankar was in Paris with his brother Uday s dance company .
In his 1995 comments on Tana Mana , Shankar writes : I lost my sweet mother at an early age , but I clearly remember her singing to me .
I dedicate this song to her beautiful spirit .
The title translates to mean body and mind .
Another track , Memory of Uday , is dedicated to Uday Shankar , who died in Calcutta in 1977 .
Private Music released Tana Mana in 1987 , with the album credited to the Ravi Shankar Project .
Shankar attributed its eventual release , four years after conception , to the advent of new-age music , a genre that Baumanns record label did much to promote .
Inside the Kremlin and Passages , the latter a collaboration with American composer Philip Glass .
Tana Mana , Friar Park and West Eats Meat later appeared on In Celebration , which Harrison compiled to celebrate Shankars 75th birthday .
Allmusic critic Adam Greenberg writes of Tana Mana : The reverberant quality of the sitar combines rather well with the chosen electronic accompaniments to form a set of coherent songs , unlike many other such attempted combinations of traditional instruments and technology .
The sitar playing is , as usual , superb ... With an extra sarod thrown in , a small front line of synthesizers , and Shankars friend George Harrison assisting on the autoharp , the pile of musicality that forms allows an unexpectedly coherent , clear , and relatively focused piece of music to emerge .
In a 2010 article on Shankar , music website Shakenstir described Tana Mana as having brought Mr. Shankar 's music into the New age with its unique method of combining traditional instruments with electronics .
The article quoted a 2007 interview in which Shankar defended his association with Western artists such as Menuhin , Harrison , Glass and John Coltrane against criticism from Indian classical music purists : Yes , I performed with Yehudi Menuhin , composed 2 concertos experimented with jazz , far eastern music , Phillip Glass , ballet , orchestration film music , music theatre and so much more - from 1945 ... If you listen to my CD Tana Mana , I have worked with electronic music 25 years ago .
But I did all this without compromising on the solid foundation of our classical music .
If few musicians didnt understand me then it was their problem .
I have no regrets

Rajeshwari had arranged musical training for her own daughter , Kamleshwari , while Siddheswari would do small chores around the house .
Once , while the noted sarangi player Siyaji Mishra , was teaching Kamleshwari , she was unable to repeat the tappa that she was being taught .
Rajeshwari ran out of patience , and started to cane Kamleshwari , who cried out for help .
The only person to help her was her close friend Siddheswari , who ran from the kitchen to hug her cousin , and took the thrashing on her own body .
At this point , Siddheswari told her weeping cousin , Its not so difficult to sing what Siyaji Maharaj was telling you .
Siddheswari then showed her how to sing it , performing the whole tune perfectly , much to the amazement of everyone .
The next day , Siyaji Maharaj came to Rajeshwari , and asked to adopt Siddheswari into his own family .

His disciples include Jitendra Abhisheki , Pandit Ram Marathe , Pandit Vasantrao Kulkarni , C. R. Vyas , Pt Yashwant buwa Joshi and Manik Verma .
Pt Bhai Gaitonde , living legend of Farukhabad gharana of Tabla , received his initial training from Pt Jagannath Buwa .
Buwa was devoted to his teachers in a day when the teachers were known for being whimsical .
One of them praised him for his devotion and said you are a real Gun-das , and this gave birth to his pen-name Gunidas .
He was born in a Karhade Brahmin family in the erstwhile Nizam state of Hyderabad .
He had basic primary education in Marathi , his mother tongue .
As was the tradition then and even now , musical talent of a person was carefully nourished through an age old custom .
Living with ones teacher , Guru .
This created a definite bond between the teacher and his disciple .
In Hyderabad , as well as many other princely states , certain musicians , be it vocal or instrumental , were patronized by the ruler .
Therefore , young Jagannath picked up many a veteran musicians to learn his trade .
He changed his teachers as many times as he could afford to .
Not that he paid any tuition of any kind .
Serving ones teachers fancies and temper is the fee .
Learned Indian percussion instrument , Tabla , very well to the point that he became a master .
Took lessons from famous teacher , Ustad Thirkawa .
His musical training continued with a gusto till he landed in the house of Agra dynastys major singer , Ustad Vilayat Husain Khan .
That was the most fortunate thing happening to this talented lad .
They , teacher and student , clicked together and Jagannaths travail was duly rewarded .
He not only received excellent training from Vilayat Khan but his admiration as well .
Jagannath was not only a fine vocalist but was an avid creator of Hindustani original themes , cheej .
After independence , the royal patronage , the source of basic income vanished and Jagannath moved in various cities to find income to support himself .
He was a celibate and had to fend for himself .
It was tough to say the least .
He managed somehow .
It requires a creativity to develop newer and fancier rendering of the traditional Ragas .
Not many can do such original renderings .
Most just copy whatever their teachers teach them and keep the style as dictated by the dynastic principles , gayaki .
One of his disciple from Pune has said following about Jagannaths musical philosophy : .
Jagannath Buwa often told me that the basic requirement of music is that magical quality called `` Rang '' .
As a quality in music , `` Rang '' transcends considerations of voice quality , grammar and communication of rasa .
While in Mumbai , he was not only admired by many a musical lovers but by generous supporters .
Two among them were V V Gokhale and his younger brother , Va Va Gokhale of Dadar .
He was a regular performer at Dadar-Matunga Music Club .
He died at Dombivli on a Diwali day in 1968 .
He was cremated at Dadar .
He was also known for his high social conscience .
When he was donated a purse by his well-wishers in 1962 to help him monetarily during his final years , India was engaged in a war with China .
After the war was over , he contributed generously to the Relief Fund for soldiers .
He dismissed his disciples protests by saying that one should not shirk ones duty and should not try to avoid paying ones dues .
A music festival named after him started by his disciple , C R Vyas in 1977 is held every year in Mumbai as well as many a major Indian cities .

Kumar Gandharva or Shivaputra Siddharamayya Komkalimath was a Hindustani classical singer , well known for his unique vocal style and his refusal to be bound by the tradition of any gharana .
The name Kumar Gandharva is a title given to him when he was a child prodigy ; a Gandharva is a musical spirit in Hindu mythology .
Gandharva was born in Sulebhavi near Belgaum , Karnataka , India .
He studied music under the well-known Prof B. R. Deodhar .
He married Bhanumati Kans in April 1947 and moved to Dewas , Madhya Pradesh .
Soon after moving there , he was stricken with tuberculosis .
Luckily , the wonder drugs which cure TB had only recently been discovered .
Gradually , helped by excellent medical support and care from wife Bhanumati , Kumar Gandharva recovered and began singing again .
However , his voice and singing style would always bear the scars of his surgery , which are evident to any person who listens to his songs such as Runanubandhachya from the drama Dev Dina Ghari Dhavla .
Bhanumati Kans , who was learning music first under Deodhar and later under Kumar Gandharva himself , nursed him through his illness .
His first mehfil after recovery from illness took place in 1953 .
The illness greatly affected Kumars singing in later years - he was to be known for powerful short phrases and his very high voice .
Kumarji also experimented with other forms of singing such as Nirguni bhajans , folk songs , and with both ragas and presentation , often going from fast to slow compositions in the same raga .
He is remembered for his great legacy of innovation , questioning tradition without rejecting it wholesale , resulting in music in touch with the roots of Indian culture , especially the folk music of Madhya Pradesh .
His innovative approach towards music led to the creation of new ragas from combinations of older ragas .
His style of singing attracted considerable controversy .
Veteran singer Mogubai Kurdikar did not consider his vilambit singing interesting and his own teacher Deodhar criticised some aspects of Kumars singing but their relationship was strained from 1940s when Kumar Gandharva married Bhanumati .
According to Pandharinath Kolhapures book on Kumar Gandharva , Deodhar was against the match .
But the criticism mostly centred around his vilambit gayaki .
His singing in faster tempos , particularly his mastery over madhya-laya , was widely revered .
Kumar Gandharvas first son , Mukul Shivputra , was born around 1955 .
After Bhanumatis death in 1961 during childbirth , Kumar married Vasundhara Shrikhande , another of his fellow-students at Deodhar School .
Vasundhara Komkalimath formed a memorable duo with him in bhajan singing .
She also provided vocal support to his classical renditions quite often .
Their daughter Kalapini Komkalimath would later accompany both her parents on tanpura .
Some of Kumar Gandharvas ideology is carried forward by his son and daughter , as well as students such as Madhup Mudgal , Shubha Mudgal , Vijay Sardeshmukh and Satyasheel Deshpande .
Kumarjis grandson Bhuvanesh has also made a name for himself as classical singer .
For a long spell , Kumar Gandharvas activities as a musician were managed by his friend and tabla accompanist Vasant Acharekar .
Acharekar was Vasant Desai s assistant in the 1950s but later devoted himself fully to his role as an accompanist to classical singing until his death in late 1970s .
His son Suresh Acharekar is also a tabla player , and has accompanied Kumar Gandharva and other artists .
Kumarji had friendly relations with noted Marathi literary couple Pu La Deshpande and Sunita Deshpande .
Kumar Gandharva was awarded the Padma Vibhushan award in 1990 .
The 4th movie in the series of 4 movies in the Kabir Project by Shabnam Virmani features the life of Kumar Gandharva and his disciples , his career and his journey into Nirgun singing .
His song Sunta Hai actually forms the title of the movie Koi Sunta Hai .

Vasantrao Deshpande was a renowned Hindustani classical vocalist who was also a great performer of Natya Sangeet .
In 1982 , he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award , given by the Sangeet Natak Akademi , Indias National Academy of Music , Dance & Drama .
Vasantrao Deshpande was born in Murtijapur , District Akola , which belongs to Vidarbha region of State of Maharashtra , in India .
He learned from several gurus , refusing to tie himself down to a single school of singing .
He started his musical training in his home town Nagpur under Shankarrao Sapre from Gwalior , who in turn was a disciple of Vishnu Digambar Paluskar .
This was followed by Sureshbabu Mane of Kirana gharana , Asad Ali Khan of Patiala gharana , Aman Ali Khan and Anjani Bai Malpekar of Bhendibazaar gharana , and Ramkrishnabuwa Vaze .
But the most important influence on him was Dinanath Mangeshkar , and Vasantrao was the sole true inheritor of Dinanaths mercurial style of singing .
At the age of 8 , Bhalji Pendharkar perceived his musical talent and launched him in the role of Krishna in Hindi movie Kaliyamardan .
He had received the training under different gharanas : Patiala , Bhendi Bazar , Kairana ; yet he did not receive the stamp of any particular gharana .
One of Indias most illustrious classical vocalists , he performed classical and semi-classical music .
In the raga form which constitutes classical music , the artist displays his creativity on a basic canvas .
Dr. Vasantrao Deshpandes rendition of famous ragas like Marwa , Salag Waraali , Nat Bhairav , Kauns , Chhayanat , Basant Mukhari , Patamanjari , Jaijaiwanti , Janasammohini , Bhoop , Shree , Kalavati , Maru Bihag , and Yaman had a quality to them that kept people interested .
His performance of offbeat ragas was not too different .
The sargam was his forte .
He was also an accomplished tabala and harmonium player .
He was equally at ease with the thumri , dadra and ghazal forms .
These find their origins in countries like Iran and Afghanistan .
He had picked up the original style and nuances of the thumri and ghazal while studying at Lahore .
He also learnt quite a bit of Urdu to elevate his ghazal performances .
Another area of music where he made his mark was Marathi Natyasangeet .
Some of the plays in which he acted and performed were Katyaar Kaaljaat Ghusli , He Bandha Reshmache , Vij Mhanali Dhartila , Meghmalhar , Tukaram and Varyawarchi Varaat .
Out of these , Katyaar Kaaljaat Ghusli became highly popular .
Vasantrao became the cynosure of everyones eye for his challenging role of Khan Aftaab Hussain Khansaheb .
As the plays popularity began to soar , he acquired the alias , Pandit Vasantkhan Deshpande .
He acted in movies like Kaaliya Mardan , Dudh Bhaat , Ashtavinayak and many more .
He gave playback to more than 80 Marathi films .
Besides pure music , he also put together the history of Marathi music plays , from origin showing their evolution up to the present stage .
This is how he presented his brainchild , his tour de force , Marathi Natyasageetachi Vaatchaal .
In this he would first explain the socio-cultural influences that shaped the musicals as they stood in a particular era and then demonstrate the evolution through its music .
The concert was first held in Delhi .
It stretched for 3 days , 6 hours each day .
The experiment was bound to be a winner with the audience .
He was a thinker and he blended these styles to develop a style of his own .
He did not believe in imitation .
Considering the timbre of his voice , pitch , range and expressive capacity , he forged his own characteristic style .
He usually began his exposition of a raag in the Jod-Aalap or ` Nom-Tom ' style and created a kind of foundation for his musical statements .
This created an aesthetic tension in the listener 's minds and then he landed beautifully on the first beat of the khayal - the ` sum ' .
His development of the khayal was always full of such tensions and releases , which pleased the audience .
He had an equal command of both common and uncommon Ragas and a large repertoire of compositions .
He presented them judiciously , considering the type of audience before him .
Dr. Vasantrao Deshpande was an academic , earning himself a PhD in The Transformation of Hindustani Classical Music .
He was also invited to several educational institutions to deliver lectures on music , quite often with live demonstrations .
Vasantrao has had several commercial releases under his name .
Among them , the more famous are his LP of Marwa and a two-cassette interview , conducted by Va Pu Kale , about the history of Marathi Natya Sangeet which showcases the breadth and depth of Vasantraos knowledge about the art form .
Vasantrao also conceived Raga Raj Kalyan , a Yaman variant with Pancham dropped altogether .
Katyaar Kaaljaat Ghusli was a successful play in his carrier .
His grand son Rahul Deshpande is a classical singer and he is carrying his style further .
He has trained under Gangadharbua Pimpalkhare , Usha Chipalkatti and Mukul Shivputra , son of Kumar Gandharva .
In 2009 , he played the lead of Khan Saheb in musical , Katyar Kaljat Ghusli , which was played by his grandfather in the 1960s .

Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee was an eminent Indian classical sitarist of the Maihar Gharana .
A student of the legendary Baba Allauddin Khan , Pandit Nikhil Banerjee was known for his technical virtuosity and clinical execution .
Along with Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Vilayat Khan , he emerged as one of the leading exponents of the Sitar and is regarded as a legend of Indian Classical music .
Nikhil Banerjee was born on October 14 , 1931 in Calcutta into a Brahmin family .
His father , Jitendranath Banerjee , was an amateur sitarist and Banerjee was fascinated by his fathers playing .
Although he wanted to try his hand at an instrument as early as the age of four , he was discouraged by his father and grandfather .
At the age of five , however , they relented and he acquired a small sitar , initially learning under his father .
Banerjee grew into a child prodigy .
He won an All-India sitar competition and became the youngest musician employed by All India Radio at the age of nine .
Jitendranath approached Mushtaq Ali Khan to take Nikhil as a disciple , but only learned from this master for a few short weeks .
Instead Birendra Kishore Roy Chowdhury , the zamindar of Gouripur in present-day Bangladesh , became responsible for much of his early training .
Around 1946 Nikhil Banerjee met the great khyal singer Amir Khan through the masters teaching of Nikhil Banerjees sister , and his enthusiasm for his music was reinforced by hearing him in concert a couple of years later .
Amir Khan continued to have a significant influence on Banerjees musical development .
In 1947 Banerjee met Ustad Allauddin Khan , who was to become his main guru along with his son , Ali Akbar Khan .
Both were sarod players .
Banerjee went to Allauddin Khans concerts and was desperate to have him as his teacher .
Allauddin Khan did not want to take on more students , but changed his mind after listening to one of Banerjees radio broadcasts .
Allauddin Khan was Banerjees main teacher , after he left Maihar he also learned from Ali Akbar Khan , the son of Allaudin Khan , for many years .
The discipline under Ustad Allauddin Khan was legendary .
For years , Nikhils practice would start at four in the morning and , with few breaks , continue to eleven oclock at night .
Among others , Ustad Allauddin Khan also taught his son Ali Akbar Khan , grandson Aashish Khan , and nephew Bahadur Khan on the sarod ; Ravi Shankar on the sitar ; his daughter , Annapurna Devi , on the surbahar ; Pannalal Ghosh on the flute ; and Vasant Rai the sarod .
Ustad Allauddin Khan was passing on not only playing technique but the musical knowledge and approach of the Maihar gharana ; yet there was a definite trend in his teaching to infuse the sitar and sarod with the been-baj aesthetic of the Rudra veena , surbahar and sursringar -- long , elaborate alap built on intricate meend work .
He was also well known for adjusting his teaching to his particular students strengths and weaknesses .
Consequently , under his teaching , Shankar and Banerjee developed different sitar styles .
After Maihar , Banerjee embarked on a concert career that was to take him to all corners of the world and last right up to his untimely death .
All through his life he kept taking lessons from Ustad Allauddin Khan and his children , Ustad Ali Akbar Khan and Smt .
Annapurna Devi .
Perhaps reflecting his early upbringing , he always remained a humble musician , and was content with much less limelight than a player of his stature could have vied for .
Even so , in 1968 , he was decorated with the Padma Shri , and in 1974 received the prestigious Sangeet Natak Akademi Award .
Nikhil Banerjee frequently toured Europe and the USA , with prominent tabla players including Swapan Chaudhuri and Anindo Chatterjee .
Although he was often resident at the Ali Akbar College of Music in California he taught few pupils on a one-to-one basis , for his stated reason that he did not feel he had adequate time to devote to his students , as he was still learning and performing .
He hoped that developing a proper disciple relationship with students would become possible later in his life , but , sadly , his early demise meant it did not happen .
Nevertheless , a number of prominent sitarists have been influenced by his teaching and distinctive style .
Banerjee recorded only a handful of recordings during his lifetime but a series of live performance recordings continue to be released posthumously making sure that his musical legacy is preserved for posterity .
He did not always enjoy recording within the confines of the studio , though his early studio recordings with EMI India such as Lalit , Purya Kalyan and Malkauns are now considered to be classic renditions of these ragas .
The posthumous live albums , many of which were brought out around the turn of the 21st Century by Raga Records in New York , and Chhandadhara of Germany , are widely considered to be the finest documents of his playing .
Many of his unpublished concert recordings are available which are testimony to his musical thought .
Nikhil Banerjee was in failing health through the 80s , having survived three heart attacks .
On January 27 , 1986 , on the birthday of his younger daughter , at the relatively young age of 54 , Nikhil Banerjee died of a fourth heart attack .
At the time of his death , he was a faculty member at the Ali Akbar College of Music in Calcutta .
He was posthumously awarded the Padma Bhushan title by the Government of India in the same year as his death .
He is survived by his wife Roma and two daughters .
His elder daughter is married into the Tagore family .
His younger daughter Debdutta/Arya is a model and actress in Kolkata .
In an interview Nikhil said he had been influenced by Allauddin Khan , Ali Akbar Khan , Amir Khan , and to a lesser extent by Omkarnath Thakur , Faiyaz Khan , Kesarbai Kerkar , and Roshanara Begum .
For Banerjee , music-making was a spiritual rather than a worldly path : .
Nikhil Banerjee is revered for his mastery in both melodic and rhythmic aspects of Indian music .
His unique style of sitar playing is considered to have completeness , emotion and depth .
His interpretation of ragas was usually traditional , although he is credited with creating at least two new ragas .
According to The San Francisco Chronicle , Banerjees .
technique is a phenomenon , faster than cheetahs , more secure than the dollar .
Music And Musicians observed that his improvisations always sound completely natural and spontaneous .
In an obituary published after his death , The New York Times wrote the extraordinary fluidity and assurance of his rhythmic ideas and phrasing set a standard that would have left the more international stars of Indian music behind .
Today , he is commonly regarded as one of the greatest sitarists of the 20th century and is often spoken of as being on a level with the other two masters Ravi Shankar and Vilayat Khan .
The following is a summary of some recent CD issues .
A more comprehensive discography can be found in the external links .
Banerjees technique is a phenomenon , faster than cheetahs , more secure than the dollar .
But he does not lean on that as most players do .
It is there , at the ready , a strength to be called on when needed .
It is his gentle playing that is so singular .
The ease of it , highlighted by atypical bits of literal reiteration create a kind of euphoric effect .
The result is remarkably individual .
One could spot a Banerjee performance on a radio broadcast or tape , a thing of great difficulty among Oriental musicians

Haafiz Ali Khan was an Indian Sarod player .
He was a tall figure in twentieth-century sarod music .
A fifth-generation descendant of the famous Bangash Gharana of sarod players , Haafiz Ali was known for the lyrical beauty of his music and the crystal-clear tone of his strokes .
The occasional critic has , however , observed that Khans imagination was often closer to the semi-classical thumri idiom than the austere dhrupad style prevalent in his times .
Son and disciple of the Sarod superstar Nanneh Khan , He grew up in a community of Sarod players , it is likely that he studied with his father and a number of his proximate disciples .
He later took lessons from his cousin Abdulla Khan , nephew Mohammad Amir Khan , and finally the beenkar Wazir Khan of Rampur .
Ustad Wazir Khan was a direct descendant of the legendary Tansen , through the lineage of the latters daughter .
Notably , Allauddin Khan of Maihar was also a pupil of Wazir Khan in Rampur in the same period .
It said that Khansahib later studied dhrupad and thumri with Ganeshilal Mishra and Bhaiya Ganpatrao , respectively .
Khansahibs regal appearance and electrifying charisma made him one of the most sought-after musicians of his time , which was no mean achievement for an instrumentalist in an era largely dominated by vocal music .
Old-timers who have seen him in concert recall his stage presence and musicianship with reverence and awe .
While still a court musician in Gwalior , Haafiz Ali would undertake numerous trips to Bengal , where he performed at all major music festivals , and taught a large number of disciples .
Khans music found generous patrons in two Bengali aristocrats , Raychand Boral and Manmatha Ghosh , both of whom studied with him at various points .
Apart from his formidable command over traditional sarod compositions , dhrupad and thumri , Haafiz Ali Khan was particularly appreciated in the Viceregal firmament of colonial India for his unique , stylized renditions of God Save The King on his sarod .
This tradition of performing sacred , religious and official state hymns on the sarod is kept alive by his illustrious son , Ustad Amjad Ali Khan as well as grandsons Amaan and Ayaan .
Haafiz Ali Khan died in 1972 , at the age of 84 in New Delhi .
A road in the name of the monumental icon of Indian classical music , Ustad Haafiz Ali Khan Saheb was inaugurated by the Honourable Chief Minister , Smt .

The alap is the opening section of a typical North Indian classical performance .
It is a form of melodic improvisation that introduces and develops a raga .
In dhrupad singing the alap is unmetered , improvised and unaccompanied , and started at a slow tempo .
Instead of wholly free improvisation , many musicians perform alap schematically , for example by way of vistar , where the notes of the raga are introduced one at a time , so that phrases never travel further than one note above or below what has been covered before .
In such cases , the first reach into a new octave can be a powerful event .
In instrumental music , when a steady pulse is introduced into the alap , it is called jor ; when the tempo has been greatly increased , or when the rhythmic element overtakes the melodic , it is called jhala .
The jor and jhala can be seen as separate sections of the performance , or as parts of the alap ; in the same way , jhala can be seen as a part of jor .
Several musicologists have proposed much more complicated classifications and descriptions of alap .
In the same way as traditional four-part compositions have a sthai , antara , sanchar and abhog , some treat alap with a four-part scheme using the same names .
Bengali researcher Bimalakanto Raychoudhuri in his Bharatiya Sangeetkosh suggests classification both by length and by performance style , and proceeds to list thirteen stages : .
Even though Raychoudhuri admits the 13th stage is wholly extinct today , as we see we are in jhala already at the fourth stage ; the sthai-to-abhog movement is all part of the first stage ; stages six and up are said to be for instrumentalists only .
Other authorities have forwarded other classifications .
For example , when alap is sung with lyrics or at least syllables , as in dhrupad , it is called sakshar as opposed to anakshar

The Patiala gharana is one of the most prominent gharanas of vocal Hindustani classical music .
It was initially sponsored by the Maharaja of Patiala , Punjab , which was famous for ghazal , thumri , and khyal .
The Patiala Gharana was founded by Ustad Fateh Ali Khan and Ustad Ali Baksh Khan .
This school of music has had a number of famous musicians , many of whom came to be patronised by the royal family of Patiala after the disintegration of the Mughal Empire at Delhi in the 18th century .

Ektaal and Teentaal are the most common taals chosen by members of this gharana .
Besides khyal , thumri singing is emphasized .
This gharana has been criticized by purists , who say it overuses ornaments and graces without considering the basic nature and mood of the raga and neglects principles of khyal architecture , as exemplified by Bade Ghulam Ali Khans quick ascent through the octave in his rendering of Darbari
Shankar Family & Friends is an album by Indian musician Ravi Shankar , recorded primarily in Los Angeles during the spring of 1973 , but not released until late 1974 .
It was produced by Shankars friend George Harrison and one of the first releases on the ex - Beatle s Dark Horse label .
Out of print for many years , and much sought after as a result , the album was remastered in 2010 and reissued as part of the Ravi Shankar-George Harrison box set Collaborations .
The title Shankar Family & Friends refers to the group-participation approach to the music , from Shankars sister-in-law Lakshmi and son Shubho to a host of friends from the Indian subcontinent , Europe and the United States .
In a deliberate blend of East-meets-West musical styles , other performers include Indian-music pioneers Alla Rakha , Ashish Khan , Shivkumar Sharma and Hariprasad Chaurasia , and Western musicians such as Tom Scott , Emil Richards , Billy Preston , Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner .
The album features the Harrison-arranged pop bhajan I Am Missing You and a jazz-funk instrumental , Dispute & Violence , the latter a part of an intended ballet , titled Dream , Nightmare & Dawn .
Although Harrison had served as Ravi Shankars producer before - on the latters 1971 Bangladesh relief EP Joi Bangla ; the soundtrack for the Apple documentary film Raga ; and a more recent live album with Ali Akbar Khan , recorded in New York - this was the first occasion that the two had collaborated on a studio album .
Harrison would later refer to these and other projects with Shankar as one of his little careers going on on the side , a series of rewarding collaborations that co-existed beside his solo career .
This time , although Shankar Family & Friends did begin life as an Apple Records project , the results would not be issued on the Beatles label , but on Harrisons own Dark Horse Records .
The bulk of the recording took place in Los Angeles during April 1973 , shortly after Harrison had completed work on his album Living in the Material World and that of Nicky Hopkins , recorded concurrently in London .
Arriving in Los Angeles in March , Harrison first attended Sunset Sound Studios , where former bandmate Ringo Starr s sessions for Ringo were getting under way .
Starr , Preston , Voormann and Hopkins would all contribute to Shankar Family & Friends over the next couple of months .
Sessions began at A&M ; Studios , Los Angeles , on 1 April and continued into May , with a break towards the end of the first month .
In addition to Starr , Preston et al. , as producer , Harrison invited Tom Scott , Emil Richards , Jim Keltner and David Bromberg along to participate .
A jazz arranger and composer , Scott had previously worked with Harihar Rao , a former student of Shankars and now an ethnomusicologist at UCLA .
These sessions marked the first time that Harrison and Scott worked together , so beginning a loose partnership that would endure through much of the 1970s .
For the Indian contingent , Shankar chose a cast of similarly illustrious names : Alla Rakha and Kamala Chakravarty , both of whom had supported him at the Concert for Bangladesh ; Ashish Khan , Shivkumar Sharma and Hariprasad Chaurasia , on sarod , santoor and bamboo flute , respectively , who had all taken part in Harrisons 1968 sessions for the Wonderwall soundtrack album ; and Lakshmi Shankar , L. Subramaniam and Harihar Rao , all of whom likewise went on to feature in the Music Festival from India venture the following year .
While the majority of the recording was completed during that spring at A&M ; , further sessions appear to have been required through to early 1974 , at Harrisons Friar Park studio .
Due to the delay in establishing a worldwide distributor for Dark Horse Records , Shankar Family & Friends was not issued for well over a year , until the autumn of 1974 .
It was numbered Dark Horse 22002 , being the new labels second release , after Splinter s The Place I Love .
Promotion for both albums included full-page advertisements in music publications such as Billboard , with Shankars release carrying the tagline : Only one artist in the world performed at the three most significant musical events of all time : Monterey Pop , Woodstock , and The Concert for Bangla Desh .
Dark Horse Records is proud to present his new music .
Despite the originality and quality of musicianship on Shankar Family & Friends , it only reached number 176 in America and failed to register at all on Britains album chart , then just a top 50 .
According to pop-culture author Robert Rodriguez , Shankar was in two minds about the albums fusion of Indian music and Western styles , remaining sensitive to charges that he was abandoning his classical roots for the rewards of superstardom .
Harrison was proud of the result , and would later name Shankar Family & Friends and its more traditional follow-up , Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India , as two of the best releases on his short-lived record label .
The album cover consists of a group photograph taken at A&M ; Studios that highlights the albums East-meets-West theme .
Shankar sports a baritone saxophone , Harrison sits behind a small drum , while most of the other musicians have swapped their regular instrument for the opposite cultures near equivalent : Keltner plays another hand drum , whereas Rakha holds a pair of drumsticks ; bass player Voormann has a tamboura , Sharma a Western-style violin , and Chaurasia a bass flute .
Side one of the original LP begins with the Harrison-arranged , Spector - esque I Am Missing You , a toe-tapping pop song about which Shankar would later recall : I dont know how I did it , but one day I wrote an English song without thinking ... George heard it and liked it so much he wanted to do a version of his own .
Released as a single , I Am Missing You features Lakshmi Shankar on vocals backed by a full Western rock band - Harrison , Hopkins , Scott , Voormann , Keltner , Preston and others - and a soaring , almost Ronette - like arrangement similar to those Harrison bestowed on his own Dont Let Me Wait Too Long and Starrs Photograph around this time .
The opening track is followed by four further Krishna bhajans , including a reprise of I Am Missing You , and concluding with a gospel - inspired reading of the traditional folk song Jaya Jagadish Hare .
Side two was written as a proposed ballet entitled Dream , Nightmare & Dawn , made up of what Harrison biographer Simon Leng describes as adventurous ensemble compositions , improvised on the spot in two days .
Shankar concedes that such an approach was a strange way of doing things , not to mention expensive .
Surprisingly , the ballet does not appear to have ever been performed in its entirety .

Hiren Roy was for many years considered to be the best sitar maker in India .
Many great musicians , including Nikhil Banerjee , Vilayat Khan , Annapurna Devi , and Ravi Shankar , have sworn by his creations .
Born in Bangladesh in 1920 , Roy went to Kolkata at the age of 12 to learn the art of sitar playing .

He started making his own sitars and soon found that local musicians praised his work .
Roy started his own shop in 1942 and spent his whole life researching the various aspects of sound , design , and composition as they impacted the sitar .
His brief studies in different styles of playing gave him not only a craftsmans eye for the making of a sitar , but also a players ear for its sound , and he quickly developed original avenues in terms of look and tonal quality .
For instance , he made the tabli and the Dandi strong enough to withstand heavier strokes and tapings on thicker strings , thus making it more appropriate for meend , an essential element of Hindustani classical music .
For his lifetime achievements , Roy was honoured in 1971 by the cultural forum called Nikkon in Kolkata .
In the 1980s , he was selected by Vishwabharati University as a member of their interview board .
Roy died in December 1992 , but his tradition has been carried on by his sons .
Oldest son Himangshu ran the business until his own early demise in 1997 .
Fourth son Amit pursued a career as a sitarist , leaving the shop to now be run by third son Barun .
Like his father a musician and an innovator , Barun has won praise from great musicians for maintaining the family quality and also adapting to changing times .

Syahi is the tuning paste applied to the head of many South Asian percussion instruments like the dholki , tabla , madal , mridangam , khol and pakhavaj .
Syahi is usually black in colour , circular in shape and is made of a mixture of flour , water and iron filings .
Originally , syahi was a temporary application of flour and water .
Over time it has evolved into a permanent addition .
Syahi functions by loading only a portion of the stretched skin with weight .
In the higher-pitched drum this has the effect of altering the resonance frequency of some lower order vibrations more than others .
The action on the left hand drum is a little different .
On other side , its position is offset and serves simply to lower the resonance frequency .
The application of the syahi is very involved .
It starts with a base layer of mucilage , followed by the application of numerous thin layers of syahi masala , which are then rubbed with a stone .
Not all of the layers are the same size .
But the final product is expected to exhibit a specific shape .
The stone abrasion is crucial to creating the syahi .
The material from which the syahi is made is inherently inflexible ; if it were simply applied in a single layer and allowed to harden , it would not allow the drum to vibrate freely .
The process of rubbing or polishing with the stone creates a tight latticework of cracks which extend down to the very base of the syahi , allowing vibrations to travel across the whole object , despite the toughness of the syahis raw material .
The process from the application of the first layer of glue and the finesse in adding the subsequent layers of syahi is the main determinant in the resulting tonal purity of the instrument and also of the longevity of the layers .
Once the preliminary leatherskin Puri is fastened onto the face of the tabla , the craftsman applies the glue in a circle on the surface leaving a half-inch margin from the Chati .
When the glue is about to set , the syahi is applied in a 2-3 mm thick layer over the glue with small spikes in the syahi layer .
Once the syahi is semi-hardened and not yet dry , the rubbing with the stone begins .
The rubbing continues till it removes the spikes and a coarse surface results .
On this , layers are then added in reducing concentric circles , each half to one mm thick .
The essence lies in beginning the rubbing before the syahi completely hardens and continuing it till the surface is nearly dry when the new layer is added .
The rubbing and its proper technique ensures that the layers are each uniformly thick , tapering slightly at the edges to smoothly merge in the layer below .
The process of rubbing generates heat in the paste applied and achieves the function of drying the paste and also the frictional vibration of the surface with the stone results in a fine latticework of cracks leaving grains of syahi attached only to the base of the layer below .
This structure gives the instrument its exceptional sonority and tonal quality among all percussion instruments and also the rich harmonics which range from its tuned pitch of a few hundred Hertz to a few KiloHertz .
If the syahi is allowed to harden without rubbing it continuously , pockets of solidity would be left in the layers and distort the tone and also result in breakage of the grains from the layers within a short span , resulting in a jarring rattling sound during playing .
The layers , as the leatherskin on which they are applied , are vulnerable to humidity in the weather and also the moisture in the players hand .
Interaction with moisture results in melting of the black crystals .
This is the reason why players frequently use powder to keep the hands dry while playing

Justin Hayward is an English musician , best known as singer , songwriter and guitarist in the rock band The Moody Blues .
Hayward was born in Dean Street , Swindon , Wiltshire , England and educated at Shrivenham School , Berkshire and The Commonweal School , in Swindon .
When Hayward was 15 he was able to afford a Gibson guitar and a Vox amplifier through performing with local Swindon groups in clubs and dance halls playing mostly Buddy Holly songs .
One of Haywards early groups was All Things Bright , which opened for The Hollies and Brian Poole and the Tremeloes .
At age 17 , he signed a publishing contract as a songwriter with the skiffle artist and record producer Lonnie Donegan , a move Hayward later regretted as it meant the rights to all his songs written before 1974 would always be owned by Donegans Tyler Music .
In 1965 he answered an advertisement in Melody Maker and auditioned as guitarist for Marty Wilde and he went on to work with Wilde and his wife in The Wilde Three .
In 1966 , after answering another ad in Melody Maker , this time placed by Eric Burdon of The Animals , Hayward was contacted by Mike Pinder of The Moody Blues after Burdon had passed on Haywards letter and demo discs to Pinder .
Within a few days Hayward had replaced departing Moody Blues vocalist and guitarist Denny Laine .
Bassist John Lodge replaced temporary deputy Rod Clarke who had stood in for departed Bassist Clint Warwick at the same time .
After beginning by singing the old blues-inspired repertoire of The Moodies 1964-1965 era , Haywards initial artistic contribution to The Moody Blues was his song Fly Me High , which was a Decca single early in 1967 .
It failed to chart but gave the revised band a new direction forward from the R & B sound they had been largely producing up to that point .
Haywards driving rocker Leave This Man Alone was then used as B side to the next Moodies single on Decca , backing Mike Pinders Love And Beauty the first Moodies record to feature the mellotron .
Haywards and Lodges integration into the Moody Blues along with Pinders use of the Mellotron sparked greater commercial success and recognition for the band , transforming them into one of pop musics biggest-selling acts .
Hayward says of Pinder : Mike and the Mellotron made my songs work .
The 1967 album Days of Future Passed , one of the first and most influential symphonic rock albums , spawned the Hayward-penned singles Tuesday Afternoon and Nights in White Satin .
The latter record went on to sell over two million copies , charting three times in the UK and has been recorded by many other recording artists .
Haywards B side song Cities being an early ecology themed item .
Hayward became the groups main onstage figurehead over the 1967-1974 period , and the most prolific songwriter and composer of several big hit singles for the band .
During this time he wrote memorable album tracks such as : Tuesday Afternoon Time to Get Away , of Forever Afternoon -RRB- , The Actor , Lovely to See You , Never Comes the Day , Gypsy , Its Up To You , Dawning is The Day , You Can Never Go Home , The Story in Your Eyes , New Horizons , The Land of Make-Believe , and Island .
Hayward wrote the bands UK # 2 hit , Question as well as Voices in the Sky , Driftwood , The Voice , Blue World , Your Wildest Dreams , I Know Youre Out There Somewhere , English Sunset and December Snow ; in all , writing 20 of the groups 27 post-1967 singles .
In addition to handling the lead vocals on his own compositions , Hayward also took a featured lead or co-lead vocal on other band members songs such as ; Dawn is A Feeling , Gimmie A Little Something , Isnt Life Strange , Candle of Life , After You Came , Ill Be Level With You , The Spirit .
Nothing Changes etc. .
The Moodies attempts to come up with another specific hit single during the 1967-68 period saw them record three other Hayward compositions ; Long Summer Days , King and Queen and What Am I Doing Here ?
all of which were then left unissued , but together with unissued songs by Mike Pinder and John Lodge later formed the studio side four of Deccas 1977 release ; Caught Live Plus Five which largely comprised a December 1969 Live Recording of a concert at The Royal Albert Hall .
Hayward also co-wrote album tracks with Ray Thomas - Visions of Paradise , Are You Sitting Comfortably , Watching and Waiting , and much later Never Blame the Rainbows for the Rain , plus later co-wrote many songs with John Lodge for The Moodies , notably Gemini Dream , Meet Me Halfway , Talkin Talkin , Want To Be With You , Once is Enough , Strange Times , Sooner or Later among others .
Haywards songs have opened each of The Moodies albums in their post Mike Pinder era since Long Distance Voyager in 1981 , and his songs , both solo compositions and co-written with John Lodge , plus his lead vocals , harmony voice , and guitar playing have been a major overriding factor in the bands work and continued success since 1981 .
Their album sales from 1978 to the present are more than 60 million .
This is the regularly quoted total of their album sales , since the total sales of their albums before 1978 is disputed due to lack of official record company data , However the period 1967 to 1974 was when their albums were charting highest in the UK and US plus worldwide - Days of Future Passed topped the US album charts on re-issue in 1972 , then was followed into the album charts by the new studio album Seventh Sojourn .
In 1974 , the Moody Blues decided to take what ended up being a four-year break from performing and recording .
Hayward continued working with Lodge and producer Tony Clarke , using musicians from the Moody Blues label , Threshold , and sounding very much like the mother group .
Together , they had a hit in 1975 with Blue Guitar , and released an album titled Blue Jays .
In 1977 Hayward recorded his first solo album Songwriter .
He enjoyed international solo success in 1978 when he appeared on Jeff Waynes Musical Version of The War of the Worlds concept album , which yielded his hits Forever Autumn and The Eve of the War .

Hayward issued a rare non-album single Marie c/w Heart of Steel in April 1979 , both sides composed by him , the A side dedicated to his wife .
These tracks were later included among the Bonus tracks on a CD re-issue of his Songwriter solo album in 2004 .
During the 1980s , Hayward composed and performed for film and television , including the theme song It Wont Be Easy for the 1987 BBC2 science fiction series Star Cops , Something Evil , Something Dangerous for the film , Eternal Woman for the film She and music for the animated television series The Shoe People .
In 1989 , with producer-arranger Mike Batt , Hayward released Classic Blue , an album of pop standards written by other composers , set to orchestration arranged by Batt .
Classic Blue included a cover version of Led Zeppelin s hit Stairway to Heaven .
Haywards solo album , The View from the Hill , was released in 1996 , and a live recording , Live in San Juan Capistrano , followed in 1998 .
Hayward contributed vocals to a song on Rick Wakeman s 1999 album Return to the Centre of the Earth .
In 2003 he sang along with other rock singers on another orchestral album , consisting of Moody Blues songs with the Frankfurt Rock Orchestra , titled Justin Hayward and Friends Perform the Hits of the Moody Blues .
Hayward was later involved in a legal dispute , now resolved , arguing he was not paid for his participation on the album .
In April 2006 , Hayward took part in the stage tour of Jeff Waynes Musical Version of The War of the Worlds , reprising his role in Autumn 2007 in Australia and in the UK in December 2007 .
He did so again in the UK in June 2009 , and appeared on the tour in November and December 2010 .
In March 2007 Hayward collaborated with a Manchester DJ Damian Corcoran , their work thrived in the underground dance scene with 1 track Its stopped entering the Billboard charts at number 3 , this track is cited as The reason I wanted to make music by Will i am .
The Moody Blues , with Hayward , Lodge and original drummer Graeme Edge , continue to tour extensively and in a recent BBC World Service interview , Hayward and Lodge made it clear they have no plans to stop working , regarding it as a privilege to still be working in the music industry .
In an interview , in 2005 , Edge said if he remained in good health , he could go on for 10 more years .
On December 10 , 2011 Hayward along with Ian Anderson from Jethro Tull and Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden played a concert together at Canterbury Cathedral .
Haywards album Spirits of the Western Sky was released on 26 February 2013 on the Eagle / Lagare International labels .

The final show of the solo tour in Atlanta , GA was recorded for a DVD project to be released soon .

However , in an interview included on the Lovely to See You concert DVD , Hayward says the 1963 Gibson 335 has been with him since 1967 .

This is an India musical raga that appears in the Sikh tradition from northern India and is part of the Sikh holy scripture called Sri Guru Granth Sahib or Guru Granth Sahib for short .
Every raga has a strict set of rules which govern the number of notes that can be used ; which notes can be used ; and their interplay that has to be adhered to for the composition of a tune .
In the Guru Granth Sahib , the Sikh holy Granth there are a total of 31 raga compositions and this raga is the ninth raga to appear in the series .
The composition in this raga appear on a total of only 2 pages from page numbers 719 to 721 .
This raga appears in the Ragmala as the first ragini of Sri raga .
In the Mesakarna Ragmala , which is almost the same as that of the Guru Granth Sahib , the first ragini of Siri Raga is given as Vairati .
However , modern sources do not give Bairari nor Vairati but Barari and Varari as well as Varati are listed .
Kaufmann believes that all of these names refer to the same raga , Barari .
Whether this is the same as the old Bairari is open to question .
The possibility always exists that Bairari was a regional tune .
It was used by Guru Ram Das for six short hymns and by Guru Arjan for one .
This raga is performed during the evening and it is currently assigned to the Marva thata .
It resembles Purva Kalyan , the main difference being the use of Pa which is strong in Bairari and weak in Purva-Kalyan .
Popley places Bairari in the same group as Sri Raga and this would agree with the Ragmala .
The following represents the order of notes that can be used on the ascending and descending phase of the composition and the primary and secondary notes : .
In the Guru Granth Sahib there are 2 pages dedicated to this raga from page 719 to 721

Bandish , Cheez or Gat is a fixed , melodic composition in Hindustani vocal or instrumental music .
It is set in a specific raga , performed with rhythmic accompaniment by a tabla or pakhavaj , a steady drone , and melodic accompaniment by a sarangi , violin or harmonium .
There are different ways of systematizing the parts of a composition .
A bandish provides the literature element in the music , for standard structured singing .
In the past many gharanas protected their bandishes from moving out of the family with gross incoherent vocal renditions .
In the realm of vocal music , it is often known as Cheez .
The word Bandish is derived from Hindi language , and literally means binding together .
Sthayi or Asthayi : The initial , Rondo phrase or line of a fixed , melodic composition .
Antara : The first body phrase or line of a fixed , melodic composition .
Sanchari : The third body phrase or line of a fixed , melodic composition , seen more typically in Dhrupad bandishes .
Aabhog : The fourth and concluding body phrase or line of a fixed , melodic composition , seen more typically in Dhrupad bandishes .
There are three variations of Bandish , regarding tempo : .
Vilambit Bandish : A slow and steady melodic composition , usually in Largo to Adagio speeds .
Madhyalaya Bandish : A medium tempo melodic competition , usually set in Andante to Allegretto speeds .
Drut Bandish : A fast tempo melodic composition , usually set to Allegretto speed , and onwards
In the context of Indian classical music , Swara is a Sanskrit word that means a note in the octave .
The seven basic swaras of the scale are named shadja , rishabh , gandhar , madhyam , pancham , dhaivat and nishad , and are shortened to Sa , Ri or Re , Ga , Ma , Pa , Dha , and Ni and written S , R , G , M , P , D , N. Collectively these notes are known as the sargam .
Sargam is the Indian equivalent to solfege , a technique for the teaching of sight-singing .
The tone Sa is not associated with any particular pitch .
As in Western moveable-Do solfege , Sa refers to the tonic of a piece or scale rather than to any particular pitch .
In the general sense svara means tone , and applies to chanting and singing .
The basic swaras of Vedic chanting are udatta , anudatta and svarita .
The musical octave is said to have evolved from the elaborate and elongated chants of Sama Veda , based on these basic swaras .
Siksha is the subject that deals with phonetics and pronunciation .
Naradiya Siksha elaborately discusses the nature of swaras , both Vedic chants and the octave .
A dot above a letter indicates that the note is sung one octave higher , and a dot below indicates one octave lower .
Or , if a note with the same name - Sa , for example - is an octave higher than the note represented by S , an apostrophe is placed to the right : S .
If it is an octave lower , the apostrophe is placed to the left : S. Apostrophes can be added as necessary to indicate the octave : for example , `` g would be the note komal Ga in the octave two octaves below that which begins on the note S .
The basic mode of reference is that which is equivalent to the Western Ionian mode or major scale .
All relationships between pitches follow from this .
In any seven-tone mode , R , G , D , and N can be natural or flat but never sharp , and the M can be natural or sharp but never flat , making twelve notes as in the Western chromatic scale .
If a swara is not natural , a line below a letter indicates that it is flat and an acute accent above indicates that it is sharp .
Sa and Pa are immovable , forming a just perfect fifth .
In some notation systems , the distinction is made with capital and lowercase letters .
When abbreviating these tones , the form of the note which is relatively lower in pitch always uses a lowercase letter , while the form which is higher in pitch uses an uppercase letter .
So komal Re/Ri uses the letter r and shuddha Re/Ri , the letter R , but shuddha Ma uses m because it has a raised form - tivra Ma - which uses the letter M. Sa and Pa are always abbreviated as S and P , respectively , since they can not be altered .
The swaras in Carnatic music are slightly different in the twelve-note system .
There are three types each of Rishabha , Gandhara , Dhaivata and Nishada .
There are two types of Madhyama , while Panchama and Shadja are invariant .
As you can see above , Chatushruti Rishabha and Shuddha Gandhara share the same pitch .
Hence if C is chosen as Shadja , D would be both Chatushruti Rishabha and Shuddha Gandhara .
Hence they will not occur in same raga together .
Similarly for two swaras each at notes 4 , 10 and 11 .
Each shuddha swara is traditionally held to have originated in the sound of a different animal , and some have additional meanings of their own .
Also , each swara is associated with one of the seven chakras of the body .
Just as the swaras ascend through the saptak , so they are mapped onto the chakras in the body in ascending order .
Komal notes are associated with the left side of each chakra ; the left channel , Ida Nadi , is the side of emotion and intuition .
Shuddha and tivra notes are associated with the right side ; the right channel , Pingala Nadi , is the side of logic .
Ragas , therefore , have more or less of an effect on a given chakra depending on the notes they contain .
In certain forms of Indian classical music and qawwali , when a rapid 16th note sequence of the same note is sung , different syllables may be used in a certain sequence to make the whole easier to pronounce .
For example , instead of sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa said very quickly , it might be sa-da-da-li-sa-da-da-li which lends itself more to a quick and light tongue movement .
In the context of Indian classical music some specific forms of swara-s fulfill the technique of playing a note .
Such ornamentations in Indian classical music is important for the proper rendition and essential to create the beauty of a raga .
Some notes are linked with their preceding or succeeding notes ; these linked notes are called grace notes or kan-swars .
Kan-swars deal with so called touch notes .
Kan-swars can be executed vocally and on instruments in three ways : .
Andolit swars are raga-specific notes that are oscillated within the Andolan alankar .
The specification of the Andolan alankar is the oscillation from a fixed note touching the periphery of an adjacent note .
By this oscillation the shrutis are touched which exist in between

In 2003 , Daron Malakian , Greg Kelso , Casey Chaos , and Zach Hill recorded a demo tape entitled Ghetto Blaster Rehearsals credited to the name Scars on Broadway .
However , in 2007 , an official letter appeared on the bands website that stated that these tracks are not in any way affiliated with Malakians later project Scars on Broadway .
Incidentally , these demo sessions produced B.Y.O.B. , which would be a major hit for System of a Down in 2005 .
Following Systems hiatus , Malakian announced his latest project -- Scars on Broadway -- a band which would include System of a Down bassist , Shavo Odadjian , and himself .
Ultimately , Odadjian was not involved with the band , and instead System of a Down drummer , John Dolmayan became a member .
After Malakian and Dolmayan experimented with different musicians the band took form and forged its sound in intense rehearsals and recording sessions with musicians Danny Shamoun on keyboards , Dominic Cifarelli on bass , and Franky Perez on guitar and backing vocals for live performances .
The group released an eponymous album in 2008 , which featured the hit single They Say .
However , shortly before the tour supporting the album , Malakian cancelled all scheduled concert and TV appearances , blaming a lack of enthusiasm and that his heart wasnt into touring .
This sudden cancellation prompted speculation and rumors that the band had broken up .
It was the last that would be heard of Malakian for more than a year .
In August 2009 , Scars on Broadway , minus Malakian , traveled to Iraq for a USO tour across the U.S. army bases .
Their setlist consisted of covers as well as a few Scars songs .
Guitarist/vocalist Franky Perez stated on his Twitter that the Scars tunes sound amazing but theyre not the same without D. .

He also stated before they left that Malakian had given them his blessing .
In 2009 Franky Perez mentioned on his Twitter that he and the D-Man were going into studio to jam , this was the first news people have heard about Malakians whereabouts for about a year .
On May 2 , 2010 Malakian reunited with Scars on Broadway at the Troubadour in West Hollywood .
It was the first time he had performed with the band since October 2008 .
The group played songs from their album as well as new songs .
Odadjian performed with the band for two songs , playing guitar .
On February 24 , 2012 System of a Down announced that the Scars on Broadway website is back online featuring a preview of a new song called Guns Are Loaded .
Malakian stayed out of the public eye following his cancellation of the tour in support of Scars on Broadways debut album in October 2008 .
In 2009 Malakian made a surprise appearance at Shavo Odadjians Halloween Party and played Suite-Pee , They Say , and an unknown song with Odadjian , Dolmayan and Scars on Broadways Franky Perez on guitar .
It was the first time that the band members performed together in more than three years .
On November 20 , 2009 , Malakian played at the Chi Cheng Benefit concert along with Deftones and also performed with Odadjian and Dolmayan .
Malakian , Odadjian , and Dolmayan played Aerials and Toxicity .
He appeared on Cypress Hill s 2010 album Rise Up , on one song , Trouble Seeker , which he also produced .
On July 29 , 2010 , Scars on Broadway released their first new studio recording in exactly two years , a Malakian-penned song called Fucking .
On August 20 , 2010 , Malakian played in Hollywood with Scars on Broadway .
On November 29 , 2010 , it was announced that System of a Down would reunite for a European tour to take place in June 2011 .
They played at the Download Festival on June 11 , 2011 .
Despite playing a number of reunion shows , the band had no plans to record new material .
In October 2011 , John Dolmayan expressed his interest in writing new material but cited that band members are all busy with their other projects
Pandit Jitendra Abhisheki was an Indian vocalist , composer and scholar of Indian classical , semi-classical , and devotional music .
While he distinguished himself in Hindustani music , he is also credited for revival of the Marathi musical theatre in the 1960s .
Abhisheki was born in a priestly Padhye Brahmin family in Mangeshi , Goa .
His family was traditionally attached to the Mangueshi Temple of Lord Shiva .
His father , Balawantrao aka Bikambhat , was a nephew and a disciple of Master Deenanath Mangeshkar , and the temple priest and a Kirtankar .
Balawantrao taught Jitendra the basic principles of Hindustani classical music .
Abhishek received further training in vocal music from Pandit Jagannathbua Purohit and Ustad Azmat Hussain Khan of Agra Gharana , and Gulubhai Jasdanwala of Jaipur Gharana .
He developed a distinct style of rendering khayal , and was also well known for his renditions of Marathi Natyasangeet and devotional songs .
After receiving a degree in Sanskrit literature , Abhisheki joined All India Radio at Mumbai for a brief period , when he came in contact with several musicians and also got an opportunity to display his musical talents by composing several pieces for radio programs .
Around this time , he received a scholarship from the Indian Government for advanced training in Hindustani classical music under Ustad Azmat Hussain Khan .
He composed vocal as well as background scores for 25 Marathi plays .
After receiving a Homi Bhabha fellowship in the late sixties , he taught at a music school run in the USA by sitar maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar .
He maintained his ties to his homeland of Goa through his association with the Kala Academy , counseling and guiding students from that state .
Besides son Shounak Abhisheki , the following are Pandit Abhishekis well-known musical disciples :
The Veena is an Indian and Pakistani plucked stringed instrument used mainly in Indian classical music .
It derives its distinctive timbre and resonance from sympathetic strings , bridge design , a long hollow neck and a gourd resonating chamber .
The earliest veenaa was an instrument of the harp type whose type survives in the Burmese harp , whereas in the last centuries and nowadays , the word has tended to be applied to instruments of the lute type or even , recently , to certain kinds of guitars developed in India .
The more popular sitar is believed to have been derived from the veena , an ancient Indian instrument , which was modified by a Mughal court musician to conform with the tastes of his Persian patrons and named after a Persian instrument called the setar .
It subsequently underwent many changes , and the modern sitar evolved in 18th century India .
A person who plays a veena is called a vainika .
The Sanskrit word veenaa which is attested already in the Rigveda has designated in the course of Indian history a variety of instruments of various types , as it is a generic term for all kinds of string instruments , just as the Tamil word yaal .
In the last centuries and today the instruments designated under the designation veenaa of which there are several kinds , have tended to be mostly instruments of the lute or cithar type , and recently the word was even applied to modified Western guitars .
But the early veenaas could be plucked string instruments of any type .
Found in the list of Musical instruments used by Tamil people out in Tirumurai dated 6th to 11th century .
The early Gupta veenaa : depiction and playing technique .
One of early veenaas used in India from early times , until the Gupta period and later dealing with instrumental music -RRB- was an instrument of the type of the harp and more precisely of the .
It was played with the strings being kept parallel to the body of the player , with both hands plucking the strings , as shown on Samudragupta s gold coins .
It is not possible to tell exactly the number of strings of the instrument on the coin , but descriptions in early literary sources of an ancient instrument called thesaptatantree veenaa seem to coincide generally with the type of instrument represented on the coin .
The instrument has bridges fixed to the main resonating chamber , or kaddu , at the base of the instrument .
Materials used in construction include teak wood or tun wood , which is a variation of mahogany , for the neck and faceplate , and gourds for the resonating chambers .
The instruments bridges are made of deer horn , ebony , or very occasionally from camel bone .
Synthetic material is now common as well .
Veena is a generic name for a host of string instruments

He was awarded the 1994 Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in Hindustani music-Vocal by Sangeet Natak Akademi , Indias National Academy of Music , Dance and Drama .
Padma Shri - Indias fourth highest civilian honor been conferred upon him in year 2012 - but he turned it down , saying the government did not care about his seniority as he was chosen for it after much younger Dhrupad singers were conferred the honour .
He was born in Udaipur , Rajasthan , where his father , the great Ustad Ziauddin Khansahib , was the court musician of Maharana Bhupal Singh of Udaipur .
He was taught dhrupad vocal & veena by his father .
After his father 's demise , he continued learning under his elder brother , Late Ustad Z M Dagar , the foremost Rudra veena player of 20th century .
Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar represented the 19th generation of the musical tradition of the Dagar family that is believed to have preserved and nurtured Dhrupad for 20 generations .
Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar has done a lot for popularizing dhrupad music by his numerous concerts and workshops .
He has performed widely in India and abroad , and received the Tansen Samman from the Madhya Pradesh government and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award .
In 2005 , he was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the North American Dhrupad Association .

Jhala is a term in Hindustani classical music which denotes the fast-paced conclusions of classical compositions or raga .
It is often characterized by the overwhelming of the melodic component by the rhythmic component .
This is sometimes effected by the rapid striking together of the chikari between notes
Alankara means ornament in Sanskrit and is used in the context of Hindustani classical music to collectively refer to the various embellishment techniques used in both vocal and instrumental music .
Some common types of alankar used in classical music are meend , kan-swar , andolan , gamaka , khatka/gitkari and murki
A raga is one of the melodic modes used in Indian classical music .
A raga uses a series of five or more musical notes upon which a melody is constructed .
However , the way the notes are approached and rendered in musical phrases and the mood they convey are more important in defining a raga than the notes themselves .
In the Indian musical tradition , ragas are associated with different times of the day , or with seasons .
Indian classical music is always set in a raga .
Non-classical music such as popular Indian film songs and ghazals sometimes use ragas in their compositions .
Joep Bor of the Rotterdam Conservatory of Music defined Raga as tonal framework for composition and improvisation .
Nazir Jairazbhoy , chairman of UCLA s department of ethnomusicology , characterized ragas as separated by scale , line of ascent and descent , transilience , emphasized notes and register , and intonation and ornaments .
The Sanskrit word raga is defined as the act of colouring or dyeing and therefore metaphorically means any feeling or passion especially love , affection , sympathy , desire , interest , motivation , joy , or delight .
Therefore , the word is used in the literal sense of the act of dyeing , and also color , hue , tint , especially the color red in the Sanskrit epics , and in the figurative sense of something that colors ones emotions .
A figurative sense of the word as passion , love , desire , delight is also found in the Mahabharata .
The specialized sense of loveliness , beauty , especially of voice or song , emerges in Classical Sanskrit , used by Kalidasa and in the Panchatantra .
The term first occurs in a technical context in the Brihaddeshi , where it is described as a combination of tones which , with beautiful illuminating graces , pleases the people in general .
Ragini is a term for the feminine counterpart or wife to a raga .
The raga-ragini scheme from about the 14th century aligned 6 male ragas with 6 wives .
Many Hindustani ragas are prescribed for the particular time of a day or a season .
When performed at the suggested time , the raga has its maximum effect .
For example , many of the Malhar group of ragas , which are ascribed the magical power to bring rain , are performed during the monsoon .
However , these prescriptions are not strictly followed , especially since modern concerts are generally held in the evening .
There has also been a growing tendency over the last century for North Indian musicians to adopt South Indian ragas , which do not come with any particular time associated with them .
The result of these various influences is that there is increasing flexibility as to when ragas may be performed .
Although notes are an important part of raga practice , they alone do not make the raga .
A raga is more than a scale , and many ragas share the same scale .
The underlying scale may have five , six or seven tones , called swaras .
Ragas that have five swaras are called audava ragas ; those with six , shaadava ; and with seven , sampurna .
Those ragas that do not follow the strict ascending or descending order of swaras are called vakra ragas .
The mood of the raga and the way the notes are approached and used are more important than the notes it uses .
For example , Darbari Kanada and Jaunpuri share the same notes but are entirely different in their renderings .
Similarly , although Bilaskhani Todi is classified under the Bhairavi thaat because of the notes it uses , it is actually closer to Todi than to Bhairavi .
The two streams of Indian classical music , Carnatic music and Hindustani music , have independent sets of ragas .
There is some overlap , but more false friendship .
In north India , the ragas have been primarily categorised into ten thaats or parent scales ; South India uses an older and even more systematic classification scheme called the melakarta classification , with 72 parent ragas .
Overall there is a greater identification of raga with scale in the south than in the north , where such an identification is impossible .
Ragas in north Indian music system follow the law of consonances established by Bharata in his Natyashastra , which does not tolerate deviation even at the shruti level .
As ragas were transmitted orally from teacher to student , some ragas can vary greatly across regions , traditions and styles .
Many ragas have also been evolving over the centuries .
There have been efforts to codify and standardise raga performance in theory from their first mention in Matangas Brihaddeshi .
In Carnatic music , ragas are classified as Janaka ragas and Janya ragas .
Janaka ragas are the ragas from which the Janya ragas are created .
Janaka ragas are grouped together using a scheme called Katapayadi sutra and are organised as Melakarta ragas .
A Melakarta raga is one which has all seven notes in both the arohanam and avarohanam .
Some Melakarta ragas are Harikambhoji , Kalyani , Kharaharapriya , Mayamalavagowla , Sankarabharanam and Todi .
Janya ragas are derived from the Janaka ragas using a combination of the swarams from the parent raga .
Some janya ragas are Abheri , Abhogi , Bhairavi , Hindolam , Mohanam and Kambhoji .
See the full List of Janya Ragas for more .
Each raga has a definite collection and orders of swaras .
In Carnatic music , there are 7 basic notes of which there are a total of 16 varieties .
The seven basic swarams of Carnatic music are : Sa , Ri , Ga , Ma , Pa , Da , Ni .
Even though Janya ragas are subsets of Janaka ragas in notation and representation , the differences between the child ragas are clear due to the differences like : .
The effect of the ragas are different from each other , even if they notationally use same swarams due to above subjective differences related to bhava and rasa .
The artists have to ensure the same when elaborating on a raga , as has been followed and expected on each raga , without digressing into the phrases of another related raga .
The raga-ragini scheme is a classification scheme used from the 14th century to the 19th century .
It usually consists of 6 male ragas each with 6 wives and a number of sons and even daughters-in-law .
As it did not agree with various other schemes , and the related ragas had very little or no similarity , the raga-ragini scheme is no longer very popular .
Ragas and raginis were often pictured as Hindu gods , Rajput princes and aristocratic women in an eternal cycle of love , longing and fulfilment.raagwap and listen punjai songs online

During the 1970s & 1980s , the institute organized annual festivals in which the most eminent of the country 's musicians performed .
In fact , some of the memorable concerts , that included performances by stars like Pd .
Ravishanker , Amjad Ali Khan , Zakir Hussain , N Rajam , VJ Jog , Sitara Devi , etc. were part of the Lucknow Festival in the 1970s .
During the same period various new courses , like `` Thumri '' , were introduced .
In 2005 , it organised a three-day classical music festival part of the Lucknow Mahotsav .
Primarily teaching vocal , dance , musciology and applied music in Hindustani classical music , the institute also started teaching western classical music in 2009 , a move that didnt go well with some chauvinists , who feared that addition of Western classical music could later lead to replacement of Bharatnatyam courses by belly dancing .
The institute offers courses in Vocal Music , Instrumental , Rhythms , Dance , Musicology & Research and Applied Music leading up to : Diploma in Music - 2 years , Bachelor of Performing Arts - 3 years , Master of Performing Arts - 2 years and Ph.D. .
Apart from this there are special for the training in Dhrupad - Dhamar , Thumri singing and Light classical music which includes music composition and direction
Pandit Satyasheel Deshpande is an Indian musician who specializes in singing khyal .
He is a disciple of Pt .
Kumar Gandharva and the son of musicologist Vamanrao Deshpande .
Like his greatest mentor - Pt .
Kumar Gandharva , Satyasheelji was born with a capacity to reproduce the music of the great masters .
This talent together with the musical exposure he received in his father , the musicologist Pt .
Vamanrao Deshpande 's house established him as a child prodigy .
Satyasheelji decided to devote himself to the study of music under the guidance of Kumarji , with whom he lived in Devas for three years in the true spirit of a disciple .
With the help of a Ford Foundation grant , Satyasheelji has established the Samvaad Foundation , at his residence in Mumbai were he has created a collection of Hindustani archives .
Satyasheelji has been performing in music festivals all over the country and abroad , and has also occasionally sung for films , his most remembered performances being those in Joothe Naina Bole in ` Lekin ' and Man Anand Anand Chhayo in Vijeta both with Smt .
Asha Bhosle .
Other films have seen him singing with Bharat Ratna Lata Mangeshkar .
` Kahen ' is Satyasheeljis two-CD anthology of 16 bandishes - both traditional as well as his own .
To quote him , While the Bada Khayal is an integral part of any performance of Hindustani music , we also have a huge repertoire of small , very meaningful compositions that audiences are deprived of .
Kahen is an attempt to present such haikus that hold their own in spite of the epic Bada Khayal .
The recordings were supervised by Pt .
Hridaynath Mangeshkar .
The album was released by Bharat Ratna Lata Mangeshkar .
Lataji has also graced the album with a few words of her own , bringing out the significance of ` Kahen ' as a musical statement .
The Thumri a form of north Indian music .
The Thumri is an expression of Shringar Rasa - a passionate , playful utterances of the young woman in love .
The music on the album makes its way through a host of attitudes - from the mountains to the plains , from Banares to the realm of the Shayars , from the Bandish and the Tappa of the courts of kings to the Thumri of the Kotha .
The album has Satyasheelji singing seven Thumris .
Each Thumri comes from a part of the country and has a different aesthetic , its own character and - consequentially - a different style of presentation .

Shankar Jaikishan , were a duo who composed Indian music for the Hindi film industry , who worked together from 1949-1971 .
Shankar-Jaikishan , along with other artists , wrote everlasting and immortal melodies in the fifties and sixties .
Their best work was noted for being raga-based and having both lilt and sonority .
Shankar Singh Raghuvanshi born in Gadarwara in Narsighpur district of Madhya Pradesh and moved to Hyderabad while Jaikishan Dayabhai Panchal belonged to Bansda , Gujarat .
During his formative years , Shankar played the tabla and learned the art formally from Baba Nasir Khansahib .
For many years , Shankar studied as a disciple of the legendary composer Khawaja Khurshid Anwar , in whose orchestra he performed .
Jaikishan was adept at playing the harmonium .
Subsequently , he obtained his musical lessons from Sangeet Visharad Wadilalji and later from Prem Shankar Nayak .
After moving to Mumbai , he became a disciple of Vinayak Tambe .
Shankar started his career with a theater group run by Satyanarayan and Hemawati , before shifting to Prithvi Theatre where he played tabla and performed some minor roles in plays .
Shankar worked as assistant to the leading composer duo of Husnlal Bhagatram .
Apart from working at Prithvi theaters , Shankar used to frequently visit the office of a Gujrati director Chandravadan Bhatt who had promised Shankar that he would give him a break as a Music Director as and when he produced a film .
It was outside the office of Mr Bhatt that Shankar saw ` ek dubla patla sunder ladka also sitting a number of times .
Although they never spoke to each other , one fine day , Shankar took the initiative of starting the conversation and then discovered that his name was Jaikishan and he too used to visit the same producer in search of some work related to music and that he was a Harmonium player .
Shankar later recollected that their vibes were right from the very beginning i.e. right from their first meeting itself they developed liking for each other and it was he who then and there assured Jaikishan of the job of a Harmonium player at Prithvi theaters .
Of course , later , Papaji honoured Shankars selection and gladly accepted Jaikishan as a Harmonium player at Prithvi .
Soon , the two of them developed very close friendship to the extent that the people started refererring to them as ` Ram-Lakshman ki jodi and by several similar-meaning nick names .
It was during this phase that Shankar and Jaikishan developed a very deep bond of friendship , mutual understanding and regard for each other and made up their mind to work together as a musical team .
Apart from following their musical pursuits , they also used to play significant roles in various plays including the famous play Pathan .
While working in Prithvi Theaters , Shankar and Jaikishan , apart from working in the music department there , used to compose tunes and were in touch with Raj Kapoor , who was working as an assistant to the famous director Kidar Sharma and was aspiring to be an actor/director .
Thus , the three had met at Prithvi Theater , run by Raj Kapoors father , Prithviraj Kapoor .
Raj Kapoor made his debut as a director with the film Aag in 1948 .
Its musical score .
However , during the recording of some song for his new venture Barsaat , Raj Kapoor had some serious differences with Ram Ganguly , the music composer of the film and decided to assign its music to Shankar who insisted on taking Jaikishan as his partner and thus came into existence the new pair of music directors named Shankar-Jaikishan who gave music for the RK production Barsaat in 1949 .
Himself being a trained singer , Raj Kapoor thus , took on board , a completely new team of composers Shankar and Jaikishan and lyricists Shailendra and Hasrat Jaipuri .
On the insistence of Shankar , he and SJ co-opted the upcoming singing talent Lata Mangeshkar , and repeated Mukesh as Raj Kapoors ghost voice for the various songs of Barsaat .
It also had the distinction of giving two firsts to Hindi cinema - a title song and a cabaret .
Their early works include Barsaat , Awaara , Badal , Poonam , Nagina , Aurat , Parbat , Kaali Ghataa , Aah , Patita , Shikast , Badshah , Mayur Pankh , Naya Ghar , Seema , Shree 420 , Basant Bahar , Halaku , Patita , Rajhath , New Delhi , Kathputli , Anari , Chori Chori , Daag , Begunah , Yahudi , Main Nashe main hoon , Kanaiah , Boot Polish , Chhoti Behan , Sharaarat , Love Marriage , and Ujala .
S-J formed a core team with lyricists Shailendra and Hasrat Jaipuri and with singers Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar .
SJ had two other lifelong companions who worked as their assistants : Dattaram Wadkar and Sebastian DSouza , the former supervising their rhythm section and the later writing musical notations for all SJ compositions and then rehearsing all the musicians of the grand SJ orchestra according to SJs compositions and directions .
SJ also patronized the immensely talented singer Manna Dey , who sang his best songs with them and used Mukeshs silken voice as playback for Raj Kapoor .
Among the directors , they worked most closely with Raj Kapoor and were considered the kingpins of his legendary banner RK Films .
They were commercial geniuses in addition to be wonderfully god-blessed on music .
They lead the Bollywood music in spite of tough competition from maestros like Roshan , SD Burman , OP Nayyar and Madanmohan and remained on the top much to the chagrin of very highly talented music directors !

S-J worked with almost all singers of their time .
They had a good working relationship with all of them and were masters in extracting the very best from every one of them .
They were steady as a team with Hasrat Jaipuri & Shailendra as their lyricists ; but after the demise of Shailendra , they worked with a host of other lyricists such as Indeevar , Gulshan Bawra , Neeraj , Verma Malik , Majrooh Sultanpuri , Vithhal Bhai Patel and Rajinder Krishan , to name a few .
S-J were the house composers for RK Films and were on their pay-roll till the end .
Raj Kapoor used to maintain a music bank where he stored compositions of S-J .
Even after the termination of the professional association between Shankar and Raj Kapoor , the latter had used a number of S-Js earlier compositions for all his films though the credits were given officially to other composers , e.g. , Laxmikant Pyarelal and Ravindra Jain .
S-J also worked with other stars like Shammi Kapoor , Rajendra Kumar , Dev Anand , Sunil Dutt , Kishore Kumar , Manoj Kumar , Biswajeet , Joy Mukherjee , Dharmendra & Manoj Kumar .
Most of S-Js films show Dattaram and Sebastian as their assistants .
Dattaram handled the percussion section of the orchestra and composed original beats , and Sebastian handled the rest .
Shankar met Dattaram when the latter was a page boy at Prithvi Theatres and stayed with him throughout .
As recalled by Dattaram , Sebastian composed the musical background of most of S-Js songs and also conducted the orchestra .
Thus S-J were fortunate to have top quality assistants and used their talents well .
Shankar-Jaikishans compositions broke new ground in Hindi film music .
Apart from relying upon their knowledge of Indian classical music , they also employed western beats and orchestration .
Shankar-Jaikishan were the pioneers in establishing the role of the orchestra in song compositions as a medium to express and enhance the meanings and feelings of songs rather than using it just as a ` filler as per the prevalent practice before their advent on the scene .
They made use of the orchestra and musical instruments in their songs which consisted of the following format : The song starts with a ` prelude , then the mukhda starts and is followed by interlude containg music pieces on the orchestra .
With very few exceptions , they always used different interludes before each stanza .
Multi-layered music studded with counter melodies played by the orchestra accompanied while the mukhda or the antara of a song was being sung and finally came the ` epilogue - the music with which the song ended after the singer had finished their singing .
Shankar-Jaikishan made a significant contribution in promoting Indian classical music throughout their career .
It was their established practice to have at least one song in a movie based on semi-classical style .
These included songs like ` Jhanak-jhanak tori baje payaliya , ` Chham chham baje re payaliya , ` Radhike tune bansari churayi , ` Manmohana bade jhoothe , ` Koi matwala aya mere dware , ` Ajahu na ayae baalma , sawan beeta jaye , ` Lapak jhpak tu aa re badarwa , ` Ye barkha bahar sautaniya ke dwar , ` Re man sur mein ga , ` Sooni sooni sans ke sitar par , ` Kate na kate raina and numerous others .
Their music in ` Basant Bahar and Amrapali both of which had every song based upon Indian classical music .
While raga Bhairavi remained their perennial favorite , SJ used a variety of Raagas in their compositions .
Shankar Jaikishan also used the western classical - based waltz rhythm in a number of songs .
Shankar-Jaikishan gave a new style and meaning to the genre of sad songs by composing them on a fast tempo .
Songs like Zindagi Mein Hardam Rota Hi Raha , Tera Jana Dil Ke Armanon , Haye Tu Hi Gaya Mohe Bhool Re , Aye Mere Dil Kahin Aur Chal and Andhe Jahan Ke Andhe Raate demonstrated this .
The last two songs , along with many others , also demonstrate the composers ' use of musical instruments - a harmonium is used to produce the effect of a piano accordion .
While working as a team , Shankar and Jaikishan used to compose their songs separately .
Generally , Shankar liked to work with Shailendra and Jaikishan with Hasrat Jaipuri though there are notable instances where Shankar worked with Hasrat and Jaikishan with Shailendra .
Between the two , Shankar was the senior partner and hence , he would usually arrange the orchestra , even for Jaikishans songs .
There was a gentlemans agreement between them for not identifying the actual composer of the song .
As a result , it has been a popular pastime for S-J aficionados to try to tell a Shankar song from a Jaikishan song .
Dance numbers , title/theme songs and soulful songs were Shankars forte while Jaikishan was a master of composing background score , apart from romantic songs and simple , catchy compositions which became instant hits .
However , Shankar was no less in this aspect of devising simple straight line tunes : Mera Joota Hai Japani being the best example of this genre .
It is said that Jaikishan would count some numbers on his fingers before coming up with the background score for a particular scene on the spot !
Two of S-Js films , viz. , Sangam and Mera Naam Joker are regarded even today as having some of the best background musical scores of Hindi films till date .
Although Jaikishan alone used to work on background scores of SJ movies , it may be an over-simplification to presume that whatever went in background scores was solely Jaikishans creation .
Since SJ had a common pool of tunes in their stock , made by either of them or by both of them jointly during their numerous music sessions/sittings , it would have been perfectly legitimate and natural for Jaikishan to have used tunes created by either or both partners wherever needed .
It is understood that in RK films , Shankar and Jaikishan both used to work on the background scores .
On the other hand , both Shankar and Jaikishan were equally proficient in scoring western music based songs .
Despite their distinct working styles and preferences , it is very difficult , if not altogether impossible , to ascribe most of their songs to only one of them .
In most of the songs , they invariably contributed to one anothers creation , either in the form of improvisation of tune or of orchestration , thus , making their compositions truly a joint effort .
Furthermore , each of the two could compose in others style now and then thereby making the identification still more difficult .
Contrary to the popular mis-conception that ` it was Jaikishan who used to handle the public relations and business/financial aspects of the duos career , the fact is that it was Shankar who had the final say on all financial/business aspects of the SJ-team .
Shankar Jaikishan made a major contribution towards the development of Jazz music in India and the new genre Indo Jazz .
Their 1968 album Raaga-Jazz style is the earliest Indo-Jazz recording in India .
In this album , considered to be one of the most innovative , SJ created 11 songs based on Indian Ragas with saxophone , trumpet , sitar , tabla , bass etc. .
During their career , S-J won Filmfare Best Music Director Awards nine times .
The last three awards were won in three successive years , thereby making S-J the first composers to score a hat trick of these awards .
S-J also came out tops in Binaca Geetmala , the legendary countdown radio program on Hindi film music , where their compositions were declared the most popular on six occasions .
These songs were Mera Joota Hai Japani in 1955 , Teri Pyari Pyari Surat Ko in 1961 , Ehsaan Tera Hoga Mujh Par in 1962 , Bol Radha Bol in 1964 , Baharon Phool Barsaao in 1966 , and Zindagi Ek Safar Hai Suhana in 1971 .
In 1959 , seven of the top ten songs for the year were composed by S-J , a sort of record that stands perhaps to this date , though the top honors for that year went to SD Burman .
The so-called disputes/differences between Shankar and Jaikishan .
In a signed article in Filmfare , Jaikishan identified unwittingly the song Yeh Mera Prem Patra Padh Kar as his composition .
This led to a lot of bitterness between the two , as Shankar considered it a violation of the unwritten agreement between them .
At about the same time , Shankar gave a break to singer Sharda and started promoting her as the new singing sensation in preference over Lata Mangeshkar .
Jaikishan , however , stuck to Lata Mangeshkar for his compositions .
In this period , Shankar and Jaikishan started taking individual contracts for films though every such film continued to show them together as the composers .
Mohd .
Rafi intervened and helped them settle their differences ; however , it is conjectured that their relationship was not same as earlier and this impacted the quality of their compositions which had started exhibiting a decline .
On the other hand , Jaikishan , Hasrat and Shankar all had denied , whenever quizzed on this topic , that there ever was any rift between them .
In fact , according to Hasrat , the division of work was by mutual agreement to cope up with the heavy work load so that Shankar and Shailendra looked after one part of the work while Jaikishan and Hasrat on the other part but this division was not rigid ; there was a lot of give and take between them even during this phase .
Towards the end , in several of their last movies such as Jane Anjane , Andaaz , Ankhon Ankhon Mein , Shankar and Jaikishan were known to be working together .
In retrospect , it appears that the so-called rift between Shankar and Jaikishan was blown out of proportion by the media and vested interests and was used later to downgrade Shankar in his post-Jaikishan years .
Since Shankar continued to support Sharda and even ghost-composed music for her film and non-film albums , it is said that Lata Mangeshkar became angry with him and discontinued singing for him .
Whereas there may be some truth in this assertion , the other fact is that Lata Mangeshkar had stopped working with him after Sangam due to her anger against both Raj Kapoor and Shankar in making her sing Budhha Mil Gaya from Sangam which she was not keen as she did not feel comfortable with the lyrics of the song .
Nevertheless , she continued singing for Jaikishan even after Sangam and till the end .
S-J enjoyed an unrivaled position in the Hindi film industry .
During their heyday and even toward the later part of their career , they were the highest paid music directors in the industry .
Barring stray exceptions , they were paid more than the leading actors and the promotional material of their films would give them more prominence than anyone else .
S-J staged a show in Shanmukhanad Hall , Mumbai in 1970 under the aegis of the Indian Navy .
In terms of attendance and grandeur , it remains unsurpassed to this day , thus providing a public seal of approval to their leading status in the industry .
Jaikishan died in 1971 due to cirrhosis of liver , a disease caused by excessive consumption of alcohol .
At the time of his death , the duo enjoyed an unparalleled popularity which was underlined by a massive turnout at his funeral procession .
Gaylord , a restaurant at Churchgate where Jaikishan used to be a regular visitor , mourned the death of its illustrious patron by lighting a candle on his favorite table for one month and keeping it out of bounds for other guests with the sign Reserved for Mr. Jaikishan .
After Jaikishans death , Shankar carried on with the banner of Shankar-Jaikishan alone .
He was clearly hampered by numerous reasons such as the departures of his soul-mate Jaikishan and his favorite lyricist Shailendra , betrayal of Raj Kapoor , continued Shankar-bashing and false propaganda by his rivals and lack of motivation on his own part due to which his music appeared to suffer in comparison to S-Js own high standards .
Also , in spite of his continued experimentation on music , the projects themselves for which he worked did not turn out to be commercial successes due to which even his good scores went largely un-noticed .
According to Lata Mangeshkar herself , it was the late Mohd .
Rafi who brought about a rapprochement between the two and she did start singing again for Shankar starting from Sohan Lal Kanwars ` Sanyasi and several other films later .
Although Shankars creations during this period for Lata as well as other singers like Rafi , Kishore , Manna Dey were quite good , most of these went un-noticed due to non-descript status of such films which bombed at the box office .
His most-successful musical hit was Sanyasi in 1975 for which he scored all songs and the entire background score based upon SJs favorite Raag Bhairavi to prove the point that SJ Bhairavi was as much Shankars as that of Jaikishan !

After Sanyasi , although some of Shankars later songs did exhibit flashes of the old maestros brilliance , overall , these films did not succeed in endearing him to leading production houses , though there were some exceptions .
For example , actor Dharmendra had signed Shankar to compose the score for his film Bichchhoo , however , since Shankar did not accept Sais intereference in his work , he opted out of the project .
Eventually , the project itself was abandoned by producer-to-be Dharmendra .
Shankar was in the running for Raj Kapoors film Satyam Shivam Sundaram , but was overlooked in favor of Laxmikant Pyarelal whose candidature was supported vigorously by Mukesh .
Ironically , Mukesh owed his standing in the film industry primarily to S-Js compositions .
Shankar was also considered for Raj Kapoors proposed film Param Vir Chakra , but the project did not see the light of day and Shankar never returned to the RK camp .
Shankar died in 1987 .
His death received nominal media coverage and his funeral was attended only by his family and some friends .
The film industry was hardly represented at his funeral , thus reinforcing the stereotype of its fickle-natured loyalties .
Raj Kapoor later paid glowing tributes to the colleague of his salad days in a televised interview .
However , it was only after Raj Kapoors own death in 1988 that the significance of his association with S-J was brought out in great detail .
Chandrakant Bhosle first noticed Shankarji , as Shankar was popularly known among his friends , in Mumbai in 1945 when Shankarji arrived in Mumbai with balle troup of guru Krishnankutty and dancer Hemawati .
Bhosle was a tabla player and had become closely associated with Shankarji .
He used to play rhythm in Shankarjis orchestra from 1945 until Shankarjis death .
A night before Shankarjis death , i.e. on 25 April 1987 Shankarji dropped Bhosle near Charni Road railway station where Bhosle stayed and drove off to his own residence at Churchgate .
On 26 April Bhosle was , as usual , waiting for Shankarji at around 10.00 a.m. to take him to the studio , but Shankarji did not turn up so Bhosle went to the studio by taxi .
All the musicians waited the whole day for Shankarji in the studio but he didnt turn up .
The next day , Bhosle read the news of Shankarjis death on 26 April .
Unfortunately , family members with whom Shankarji was staying did not inform Bhosle , Raj Kapoor or anybody from the film fraternity about Shankarjis death .
It was Mr. Gokhale , who was once a cook in Shankarjis house , who later became Pujari in Gora Ram Mandir at Thakurdwar , Mumbai , who informed people that Shankarji was cremated hastily on the day of his death , without the knowledge of others .
Chandrakant Bhosle is now settleled in GOPURAM ShriRang Nagar , Near Rathi Amrai , Gangapur Road , Nashik , Maharashtra
Hindustani classical music is the Hindustani or North Indian style of Indian classical music found throughout the northern Indian subcontinent .
The style is sometimes called North Indian classical music or Shastriya Sangit .
It is a tradition that originated in Vedic ritual chants and has been evolving since the 12th century CE , primarily in what is now North India , Pakistan and Bangladesh and to some extent in Nepal and Afghanistan .
Today , it is one of the two subgenres of Indian classical music , the other being Carnatic music , the classical tradition of South India .
The tradition was born out of a cultural synthesis of several musical traditions : the Vedic chant tradition , dating back to more than three thousand years ago , the ancient Persian tradition of Musiqi-e assil , and various folk traditions prevalent in the region .
It is traditional for performers who have reached a distinguished level of achievement to be awarded titles of respect ; Hindus are usually referred to as pandit and Muslims as ustad .
An aspect of Hindustani music going back to Sufi times is the tradition of religious neutrality : Muslim ustads may sing compositions in praise of Hindu deities , and vice versa .
Around the 12th century , Hindustani classical music diverged from what eventually came to be identified as Carnatic classical music .
The central notion in both these systems is that of a melodic mode or raga , sung to a rhythmic cycle or tala .
The tradition dates back to the ancient Samaveda , , which deals with the norms for chanting of srutis or hymns such as the Rig Veda .
These principles were refined in the musical treatises Natya Shastra , by Bharata , and Dattilam .
In medieval times , the melodic systems were fused with ideas from Persian music , particularly through the influence of Sufi composers like Amir Khusro , and later in the Moghul courts .
Noted composers such as Tansen flourished , along with religious groups like the Vaishnavites .
After the 16th century , the singing styles diversified into different gharanas patronized in different princely courts .
Around 1900 , Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande consolidated the musical structures of Hindustani classical music , called ragas , into a number of thaats .
Indian classical music has seven basic notes with five interspersed half-notes , resulting in a 12-note scale .
Unlike the 12-note scale in Western music , the base frequency of the scale is not fixed , and intertonal gaps may also vary ; however , with the gradual replacement of the sarangi by the harmonium , an equal tempered scale is increasingly used .
The performance is set to a melodic pattern called a raga characterized in part by specific ascent and descent sequences , which may not be identical .
Other characteristics include king and queen notes and characteristic phrases .
In addition each raga has its natural register and portamento rules .
Performances are usually marked by considerable improvisation within these norms .
Music was first formalized in India in connection with preserving the sruti texts , primarily the four vedas , which are seen as apaurasheya .
Not only was the text important , but also the manner in which they had been enunciated by the immortals .
Prosody and chanting were thus of great importance , and were enshrined in the two vedangas called shiksha and chhandas ; these remained a key part of the brahmanic educational system till modern times .
The formal aspects of the chant are delineated in the Samaveda , with certain aspects , e.g. the relation of chanting to meditation , elaborated in the Chandogya Upanishad .
Priests involved in these ritual chants were called samans and a number of ancient musical instruments such as the conch , lute , flute , trumpets and horns were associated with this and later practices of ritual singing .
The Samaveda outlined the ritual chants for singing the verses of the Rigveda , particularly for offerings of Soma .
It proposed a tonal structure consisting of seven notes , which were named , in descending order , krusht , pratham , dwitiya , tritiya , chaturth , mandra and atiswar .
These refer to the notes of a flute , which was the only fixed-frequency instrument .
This is why the second note is called pratham .
Music is dealt with extensively in the Valmiki Ramayana .
Narada is an accomplished musician , as is Ravana ; Saraswati with her veena is the goddess of music .
Gandharvas are presented as spirits who are musical masters , and the gandharva style looks to music primarily for pleasure , accompanied by the soma rasa .
In the Vishnudharmottara Purana , the Naga king Ashvatara asks to know the svaras from Saraswati .
The most important text on music in the ancient canon is Bharata s Natya Shastra , composed around the 3rd century CE .
The Natya Shastra deals with the different modes of music , dance , and drama , and also the emotional responses they are expected to evoke .
The scale is described in terms of 22 micro-tones , which can be combined in clusters of four , three , or two to form an octave .
While the term raga is articulated in the Natya Shastra , it finds a clearer expression in what is called jati in the Dattilam , a text composed shortly after or around the same time as Natya Shastra .
The Dattilam is focused on gandharva music and discusses scales , defining a tonal framework called grama in terms of 22 micro-tonal intervals comprising one octave .
It also discusses various arrangements of the notes , the permutations and combinations of note-sequences , and alankara or elaboration .
Dattilam categorizes melodic structure into 18 groups called jati , which are the fundamental melodic structures similar to the raga .
The names of the jatis reflect regional origins , for example andhri and oudichya .
Music also finds mention in a number of texts from the Gupta period ; Kalidasa mentions several kinds of veena , as well as percussion instruments , the flute and conch .
Music also finds mention in Buddhist and Jain texts from the earliest periods of the Christian era .
Narada s Sangita Makarandha treatise , from about 1100 CE , is the earliest text where rules similar to those of current Hindustani classical music can be found .
Narada actually names and classifies the system in its earlier form before the Persian influences introduced changes in the system .
Jayadeva s Gita Govinda from the 12th century was perhaps the earliest musical composition sung in the classical tradition called Ashtapadi music .
In the 13th century , Sharngadeva composed the Sangita Ratnakara , which has names such as the turushka todi , revealing an influx of ideas from Islamic culture .
This text is the last to be mentioned by both the Carnatic and the Hindustani traditions and is often thought to date the divergence between the two .
The advent of Islamic rule under the Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire over northern India caused considerable cultural interchange .
Increasingly , musicians received patronage in the courts of the new rulers , who in their turn , started taking increasing interest in local music forms .
While the initial generations may have been rooted in cultural traditions outside India , they gradually adopted many aspects from their kingdoms which retained the traditional Hindu culture .
This helped spur the fusion of Hindu and Muslim ideas to bring forth new forms of musical synthesis like qawwali and khyal .
The most influential musician of the Delhi Sultanate period was Amir Khusrau , sometimes called the father of modern Hindustani classical music .
A composer in Persian , Turkish , Arabic , as well as Braj Bhasha , he is credited with systematizing many aspects of Hindustani music , and also introducing several ragas such as Yaman Kalyan , Zeelaf and Sarpada .
He created the qawwali genre , which fuses Persian melody and beat on a dhrupad like structure .
A number of instruments were also introduced in his time .
Amir Khusrau is sometimes credited with the origins of the khyal form , but the record of his compositions do not appear to support this .
The compositions by the court musician Sadarang in the court of Muhammad Shah bear a closer affinity to the modern khyal .
They suggest that while khyal already existed in some form , Sadarang may have been the father of modern khyal .
Much of the musical forms innovated by these pioneers merged with the Hindu tradition , composed in the popular language of the people in the work of composers like Kabir or Nanak .
This can be seen as part of a larger Bhakti tradition , which remained influential across several centuries ; notable figures include Jayadeva , Vidyapati , Chandidas , and Meerabai .
As the Mughal Empire came into closer contact with Hindus , especially under Jalal ud-Din Akbar , music and dance also flourished .
In particular , the musician Tansen introduced a number of innovations , including ragas and particular compositions .
Legend has it that upon his rendition of a night-time raga in the morning , the entire city fell under a hush and clouds gathered in the sky , and that he could light fires by singing the raga Deepak , which is supposed to be composed of notes in high octaves .
At the royal house of Gwalior , Raja Mansingh Tomar also participated in the shift from Sanskrit to the local idiom as the language for classical songs .
He himself penned several volumes of compositions on religious and secular themes , and was also responsible for the major compilation , the Mankutuhal , which outlined the major forms of music prevalent at the time .
In particular , the musical form known as dhrupad saw considerable development in his court and remained a strong point of the Gwalior gharana for many centuries .
After the dissolution of the Mughal empire , the patronage of music continued in smaller princely kingdoms like Lucknow , Patiala , and Banaras , giving rise to the diversity of styles that is today known as gharanas .
Many musician families obtained large grants of land which made them self-sufficient , at least for a few generations .
Meanwhile the Bhakti and Sufi traditions continued to develop and interact with the different gharanas and groups .
Until the late 19th century , Hindustani classical music was imparted on a one-on-one basis through the guru-shishya tradition .
This system had many benefits , but also several drawbacks ; in many cases , the shishya had to spend most of his time serving his guru with a hope that the guru might teach him a cheez or two .
In addition , the system forced the music to be limited to a small subsection of the Indian community .
To a large extent it was limited to the palaces and dance halls .
It was shunned by the intellectuals , avoided by the educated middle class , and in general looked down upon as a frivolous practice .
Then a fortunate turn of events started the renaissance of Hindustani classical music .
First , as the power of the maharajahs and nawabs declined in early 20th century , so did their patronage .
With the expulsion of Wajid Ali Shah to Calcutta after 1857 , the Lucknavi musical tradition came to influence the music of renaissance in Bengal , giving rise to the tradition of Ragpradhan gan around the turn of the century .
Also , at the turn of the century , two great stars emerged on the horizon : Vishnu Digambar Paluskar and Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande .
Independent of each other , they spread Hindustani classical music to the masses in general , and the Marathi middle class in particular .
These two gentlemen brought classical music to the masses by organizing music conferences , starting schools , teaching music in class-rooms , and devising a standardized grading and testing system , and by standardizing the notation system .
Vishnu Digambar Paluskar emerged as a talented musician and organizer despite having been blinded at age 12 .
His books on music , as well as the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya music school that he opened in Lahore in 1901 , helped foster a movement away from the closed gharana system .
Paluskars contemporary Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande recognized the many rifts that had appeared in the structure of Indian classical music .
He undertook extensive research visits to a large number of gharanas , Hindustani as well as Carnatic , collecting and comparing compositions .
Between 1909 and 1932 , he produced the monumental four-volume work Hindustani Sangeetha Padhathi , which suggested a transcription for Indian music , and described the many traditions in this notation .
Finally , it consolidated the many musical forms of Hindustani classical music into a number of thaats , subsequent to the Melakarta system that reorganized Carnatic tradition in the 17th century .
The ragas as they exist today were consolidated in this landmark work , although there are some inconsistencies and ambiguities in Bhatkandes system .
The now tiny state of Goa has contributed a lot to Indian Classical music.Some of the renowned singers from 19th,-21st century hail from the state of Goa where the music was kept alive in the temples .
In modern times , the government-run All India Radio , Bangladesh Betar and Radio Pakistan helped to bring the artists to public attention , countering the loss of the patronage system .
The first star was Gauhar Jan , whose career was born out of Fred Gaisberg s first recordings of Indian music in 1902 .
With the advance of films and other public media , musicians started to make their living through public performances .
As India was exposed to Western music , some Western melodies started merging with classical forms , especially in popular music .
A number of Gurukuls , such as that of Alauddin Khan at Maihar , flourished .
In more modern times , corporate support has also been forthcoming , as at the ITC Sangeet Research Academy .
Meanwhile , Hindustani classical music has become popular across the world through the influence of artists such as Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan .
The rhythmic organization is based on rhythmic patterns called tala .
The melodic foundations are called ragas .
One possible classification of ragas is into melodic modes or parent scales , known as thaats , under which most ragas can be classified based on the notes they use .
Thaats may consist of up to seven scale degrees , or swara .
Hindustani musicians name these pitches using a system called Sargam , the equivalent of the Western movable do solfege : .
Both systems repeat at the octave .
The difference between sargam and solfege is that re , ga , ma , dha , and ni can refer to either Natural or altered Flat or Sharp versions of their respective scale degrees .
As with movable do solfege , the notes are heard relative to an arbitrary tonic that varies from performance to performance , rather than to fixed frequencies , as on a xylophone .
The fine intonational differences between different instances of the same swara are called srutis .
The three primary registers of Indian classical music are mandra , madhya and taar .
Since the octave location is not fixed , it is also possible to use provenances in mid-register for certain ragas .
A typical rendition of Hindustani raga involves two stages : .
Hindustani classical music is primarily vocal-centric , insofar as the musical forms were designed primarily for vocal performance , and many instruments were designed and evaluated as to how well they emulate the human voice .
The major vocal forms or styles associated with Hindustani classical music are dhrupad , khyal , and tarana .
Other forms include dhamar , trivat , chaiti , kajari , tappa , tap-khyal , ashtapadis , thumri , dadra , ghazal and bhajan ; these are folk or semi-classical or light classical styles , as they often do not adhere to the rigorous rules of classical music .
Dhrupad is an old style of singing , traditionally performed by male singers .
It is performed with a tambura and a pakhawaj as instrumental accompaniments .
The lyrics , some of which were written in Sanskrit centuries ago , are presently often sung in brajbhasha , a medieval form of North and East Indian languages that was spoken in Eastern India .
The rudra veena , an ancient string instrument , is used in instrumental music in dhrupad .
Dhrupad music is primarily devotional in theme and content .
It contains recitals in praise of particular deities .
Dhrupad compositions begin with a relatively long and acyclic alap , where the syllables of the following mantra is recited : .
The alap gradually unfolds into more rhythmic jod and jhala sections .
These sections are followed by a rendition of bandish , with the pakhawaj as an accompaniment .
The great Indian musician Tansen sang in the dhrupad style .
A lighter form of dhrupad , called dhamar , is sung primarily during the festival of Holi .
Dhrupad was the main form of northern Indian classical music until two centuries ago , when it gave way to the somewhat less austere khyal , a more free-form style of singing .
Since losing its main patrons among the royalty in Indian princely states , dhrupad risked becoming extinct in the first half of the twentieth century .
However , the efforts by a few proponents from the Dagar family have led to its revival and eventual popularization in India and in the West .
Some of the best known vocalists who sing in the Dhrupad style are the members of the Dagar lineage , including the senior Dagar brothers , Nasir Moinuddin and Nasir Aminuddin Dagar ; the junior Dagar brothers , Nasir Zahiruddin and Nasir Faiyazuddin Dagar ; and Wasifuddin , Fariduddin , and Sayeeduddin Dagar .
Other leading exponents include the Gundecha Brothers , who have received training from some of the Dagars .
Leading vocalists outside the Dagar lineage include the Mallik family of Darbhanga tradition of musicians ; some of the leading exponents of this tradition were Ram Chatur Mallick , Siyaram Tiwari , and Vidur Mallick .
A section of dhrupad singers of Delhi Gharana from Mughal emperor Shah Jahan 's court migrated to Bettiah under the patronage of the Bettiah Raj , giving rise to the Bettiah Gharana .
Bishnupur Gharana , based in West Bengal , is a key school that has been propagating this style of singing since Mughal times .
Khyal is a Hindustani form of vocal music , adopted from medieval Persian music and based on Dhrupad .
Khyal , literally meaning thought or imagination in Hindustani , is unusual as it is based on improvising and expressing emotion .
A Khyal is a two - to eight-line lyric set to a melody .
The lyric is of an emotional account possibly from poetic observation .
Khyals are also popular for depicting the emotions between two lovers , situations of ethological significance in Hinduism and Islam , or other situations evoking intense feelings .
Khyal contains a greater variety embellishments and ornamentations compared to dhrupad .
Khyal s romanticism has led to it becoming to most popular genre of Hindustani classical music .
Th importance of the Khyals content is for the singer to depict , through music in the set raga , the emotional significance of the Khyal .
The singer improvises and finds inspiration within the raga to depict the Khyal .
The origination of Khyal is controversial , although it is accepted that this style was based on Dhrupad and influenced by Persian music .
Many argue that Amir Khusrau created the style in the late 16th century .
This form was popularized by Mughal Emperor Mohammad Shah , through his court musicians .
Some well-known composers of this period were Sadarang , Adarang , and Manrang .
Another vocal form , taranas are medium - to fast-paced songs that are used to convey a mood of elation and are usually performed towards the end of a concert .
They consist of a few lines of poetry with soft syllables or bols set to a tune .
The singer uses these few lines as a basis for fast improvisation .
The tillana of Carnatic music is based on the tarana , although the former is primarily associated with dance .
Tappa is a form of Indian semi-classical vocal music whose specialty is its rolling pace based on fast , subtle , knotty construction .
It originated from the folk songs of the camel riders of Punjab and was developed as a form of classical music by Mian Ghulam Nabi Shori or Shori Mian , a court singer for Asaf-Ud-Dowlah , the Nawab of Awadh .
Nidhubabur Tappa , or tappas sung by Nidhu Babu were very popular in 18th and 19th-century Bengal .
Among the living performers of this style are Laxmanrao Pandit , Shamma Khurana , Manvalkar , Girija Devi , Ishwarchandra Karkare , and Jayant Khot .
Thumri is a semi-classical vocal form said to have begun in Uttar Pradesh with the court of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah , .
There are three types of thumri : poorab ang , Lucknavi and Punjabi thumri .
The lyrics are typically in a proto-Hindi language called Brij Bhasha and are usually romantic .
Some recent performers of this genre are Abdul Karim Khan , the brothers Barkat Ali Khan and Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , Begum Akhtar , Girija Devi , Beauty Sharma Barua , Nazakat-Salamat Ali Khan , Pt Ajoy Chakrabarty , Prabha Atre , Siddheshwari Devi , and Shobha Gurtu .
Ghazal is an originally Persian form of poetry .
In the Indian sub-continent , Ghazal became the most common form of poetry in the Urdu language and was popularized by classical poets like Mir Taqi Mir , Ghalib , Daagh , Zauq and Sauda amongst the North Indian literary elite .
Vocal music set to this mode of poetry is popular with multiple variations across Iran , Afghanistan , Central Asia , Turkey , India , Bangladesh and Pakistan .
Ghazal exists in multiple variations , including semi-classical , folk and pop forms .
Although Hindustani music clearly is focused on the vocal performance , instrumental forms have existed since ancient times .
In fact , in recent decades , especially outside South Asia , instrumental Hindustani music is more popular than vocal music , partly due to a somewhat different style and faster tempo , and partly because of a language barrier for the lyrics in vocal music .
A number of musical instruments are associated with Hindustani classical music .
The veena , a string instrument , was traditionally regarded as the most important , but few play it today and it has largely been superseded by its cousins the sitar and the sarod , both of which owe their origin to Persian influences .
Other plucked or struck string instruments include the surbahar , sursringar , santoor , and various versions of the slide guitar .
Among bowed instruments , the sarangi , esraj and violin are popular .
The bansuri , shehnai and harmonium are important wind instruments .
In the percussion ensemble , the tabla and the pakhavaj are the most popular .
Various other instruments have also been used in varying degrees
Kamala Shankar was born in 1966 in the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu -RRB- .
She is a Hindustani classical guitar player .
Shankar is the first woman to have been awarded a doctorate in guitar .
Kamala was trained in music by her mother from the age of six , and went on to study with khyal singer Channulal Mishra and sitar maestro Bimalendu Mukherjee .
She received a doctorate of music from vichitra-beenkar Gopal Shankar Mishra at Banaras Hindu University , and also holds bachelors degrees in both vocal music and zoology .
Dr Kamala Shankar has been awarded the Indias National Award in Music titled Rashtriya Kumar Gandharva Samman .
The guitar has only recently begun to be adopted to Indian classical music , and many players modify the instrument with their own developments to better suit the idiom .
In this , Shankar is no exception .
Her model , the Shankar guitar , is made from a single block of wood , with thicker walls and no sound hole .
It has four melody strings , four chikari and 12 taraf .
The guitar is named after Shankar Bhagwan .
Shankar calls it a modified version of the Hawaiian guitar .

Born in Alwar , Rajasthan in the year1927 into the illustrious Dagar family , Ustad Rahim Fahimuddin Khan Dagar is the son of Padma Bhushan Ustad Allabande Rahimuddin Khan Dagar who passed away in 1975 .
Initiated into the art of dhrupad at the age of five by his uncle Ustad Nasiruddin Khan Dagar , he received musical education for a period of 35 years from his father and family elders .
In his words , `` this included full mastery over the 52 alankaars , Nada Yoga , Rudra Veena , Sanskrit education and of course Dhrupad-Dhamar . ''
He studied Rudra Veena from his uncle Ustad Ziauddin Khan Dagar for twelve years .
He also took occasional lessons from his other uncles Ustad Hussainuddin Khan Dagar and Ustad Imamuddin Khan Dagar .
He learnt sanskrit from his father and Pt .
Giridharilal Shastri .
Ustad Rahim Fahimuddin Khan Dagar is known not only for the power and spontaneity of his alaap , but also for his rich repertoire of compositions , some of which are believed to date back to the 12th and 13th centuries.As he likes to put it about Dhrupad , In the words of my ancestor Shat Shastri Baba Behram Khan Dagar , Dhrupad , as presented within our Dagar bani , is ` ragatmak-swaratmak , shabdatmak-varnatmak , talatmak-layatmak and rasatmak .
The singer has to portray its kalatmak , vidyatmak and adhyatmak aspects to do proper justice to it .
It is the quality of music which has taken him to many countries like the USA , France , Germany and Italy for performances before select audiences .
His recordings have been released in Switzerland , Germany and Italy .

He married Basiran Bibi , daughter of khyal singer Bande Hussain .
He settled with his family in Calcutta , where , though he only lived to 43 , he did much pioneering work on the sitar .
For example , he standardised its physical dimensions and added the upper resonator gourd , which is very popular with todays players .
In a place rapidly developing into an important North Indian centre of the arts , at a time where interest in national culture was strong fuelled by the struggle for independence , he brought sitar music out from its narrow connoisseur circles to new mass audiences .
Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore was a musical collaborator and personal friend .
Some of Enayat Khans recordings have been released on CD , on the Great Gharanas : Imdadkhani compilation in RPG / EMI s Chairmans Choice series .

Ustad Abdul Karim Khan , was an Indian classical singer of the Kirana Gharana .
Abdul Karim Khan was born in Kairana village in Muzaffarnagar , Uttar Pradesh into a musical family which traced its roots to musician brothers Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Maula .
His father , Kale Khan was the grandson of Ghulam Ali .
Karim Khan received training under uncle Abdulla Khan and father Kale Khan .
He also received guidance from another uncle Nanhe Khan .
Apart from vocals and sarangi , he also learnt Veena , Sitar and Tabla .
According to a story , he was initially a sarangi player , but decided to switch to vocals because of low status of sarangi players .
In early years he used to sing with his brother Abdul Haq .
They appeared before Murtuza Khan of the Maula Bakhsh khandan in order to appear before the Mahajara and were influenced by Murtuzas style .
Baroda ruler was impressed by this singing duo and made them the court musicians .
This is where he met Tarabai Mane , who was the daughter of Sardar Maruti Rao Mane , a member of the royal family .
When they decided to get married , they were ousted from Baroda .
The couple settled down in Bombay .
In 1922 Tarabai Mane left Abdul Karim Khan , which apparently had a major impact on his music - making it pensive and meditative .
Karim Khans first wife , Gafooran was the sister of another Kirana master Abdul Wahid Khan , who was also his cousin .
Ustad Abdul Karim Khan was invited to the Mysore court where he met famous Carnatic music Carnatic masters which also influenced his music .
In particular the singing of his Sargam was a direct influence of Carnatic practice .
He became a frequent visitor to Mysore Darbar which conferred on him the title Sangeet Ratna .
On the way to Mysore he used to stay with his brother in Dharwad where he taught his most famous disciple Sawai Gandharva .
In 1900 for eight months he taught Kesarbai Kerkar , who would go on to be one of the 20th centurys most renowned vocalists .
In 1913 he founded the Arya Sangeet Vidyalaya in Poona to teach students .
He would wholeheartedly teach all his students unlike other family ustads of the era .
He finally settled down in Miraj till his death in 1937 when returning from a concert tour of the south .
Every year in August commemorative music concerts are held in Miraj .
The innovations he brought to his vocal style distinguishes Kirana style from others .
The slow melodic development of the raga in Vilambit laya slow tempo was the most characteristic aspect of his music .
He worked hard to maintain his voice to be sweet and melodious which shaped his music .
The thumri style he developed as also quite different from the Poorab ang or Punjabi ang .
His thumri progresses in a leisurely languor with ample abandonment .
He was also the first Hindustani musician to seriously study the Carnatic system and probably the first to be invited to sing all over the south .
He has even recorded a Thyagaraja Krithi .
He was also influenced by Rehmet Khan of the Gwalior gharana and adopted the direct style of presentation .
His some popular disciples were Rambhau Kundagolkar , Balkrishna Kapileshwari , Roshanara Begum , Sureshbabu Mane , Dashrath Mule , Vishwanathbuwa Jadhav , Ustad Waheed Khan , Hafizulla Khan , Mahmood Khan , Mashkoor Ali Khan , Arshad Ali etc
Pandit Biswajit Roy Chowdhury was born in 1956 , in Deogarh , Chowdhury was initiated into music by his father Shri Ranajit Roy Chowdhary , who was teacher of chemistry by profession but , more importantly , a serious Sarod player trained under the Late Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan and others .
In 1978 , Roy Chowdhurys talents were spotted by the Maestro Ustad Amjad Ali Khan accepting him as a disciple .
A turning point came when Pandit Mallikarjun Mansur took an interest in young Roy Chowdhurys quest in 1982 .
The union of an instrument player with Pandit Mansur set the journey on the path of fulfilling this quest .
Biswajit Roy Chowdhary 's tutelage with Pandit Mallikarjun Mansur was formalized in a gandhabandhan ceremony in 1985 and the intensive guidance and training lasted till the demise of the guru in 1992 .
He is perhaps the only Sarod player who plays the coveted compositions from the Jaipur-Atrauli tradition .
Over the years Biswajit Roy Chowdhary has performed in various locations all over India and has participated regularly in some of the prestigious concerts .
These include The Tansen Festival in Gwalior , the Shankar Lal Festival , New Delhi , the Harvallabh Sangeet Samaroha in Jalundhar , the Vishnu Digambar Jayanti in Delhi , the Sankat Mochan Music Festival in Banaras , the BKF Mansur Festival in Bangalore , among others .

The Jaipur-Atrauli gharana is a Khayal - based stylized singing family-hood , founded by Utd .
Alladiya Khan in the late 19th century .
Evolved from Dhrupad singing , the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana acquired its name and status as a Gharana in the early half of the 20th century as a result of the growing popularity of stalwarts of this Gharana , like Smt .
Kesarbai Kerkar , Smt .
Mogubai Kurdikar and Pt .
Mallikarjun Mansur .
The founder of this gharana , Utd .
Alladiya Khan initially developed the unique Gayaki of this Gharana following the loss of his voice which prompted him to develop an adjusted singing style to accommodate his ailment .
Signature and specialty Raags of this Gharana include Sampoorna Malkauns , Basanti Kedar , Basant Bahar , Bihagda , Kaushi Kanada , and Nat Kamod among others .
Four major Gharanas are recognized in Hindustani Classical Khayal music : Gwalior , Agra , Kirana and Jaipur-Atrauli .
Others are less pervasive , but no less enchanting , such as Indore , Rampur , Mewati , Patiala , and Bhendi-Bazar .
The Jaipur-Atrauli gharana acquired its name and status as a Gharana from the time of Alladiya Khan in the early half of the 20th century .
This Gharana mainly evolved from Dagar-bani of Dhrupad , however it also absorbed finer essence of Gauhar-bani and Khandar-bani .
The ancestral origin of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana was said to be from Nath Vishwambhar , noted for setting to Raags the tunes of the shlokas in his puja .
The great musician composer Swami Haridas was also born in this family and the great Tansen and Baiju were his pupils .
Natthu Khan and Mantol Khan were two stalwarts of this Gharana , four to five generations down the line .
They imbibed the practices of both Hindu and Muslim traditions .
Alladiya Khan , for instance , wore the Janva all his life , dressed like a Maharashtrian , complete with the Kolhapuri turban , yet did not skip a day of his Namaaz .
His compositions praise Mahadev and Allah with equal fervor .
Many of the Raags and compositions sung in the Jaipur gharana come from the tradition of Haveli Sangeet , like the compositions Deva Deva Satsang in Raag Savani Kalyan , Aadidata Ant in Raag Malkauns , Anahat Aadi Naad in Raag Savani Nat , Devta Aadi Sab in Raag Kukubh Bilawal , Devi Durge in Raag Sukhiya Bilawal , and a host of others in which Hindu devotional themes were used by Utd .
Alladiya Khan .
Scholars say the hyphenated moniker of this Gharana recognizes that Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana musicians originally came from Atrauli near Aligarh and migrated to the court of the Maharaja of Jaipur , their principal patron .
Others say they came to the Jaipur Maharajas court and then dispersed to various other courts in the area , like Jodhpur , Uniyara , Bundi , Atrauli etc. .
After establishing himself in the north , Utd .
Alladiya Khan migrated to the court of Shahu Maharaj in Kolhapur and became his court musician .
Utd .
Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan was initiated into music by his father , Khwaja Ahmad Khan and his uncle , Jehangir Khan in both the Dhrupad and Khayal styles .
He also had the privilege of being guided by two famous composers of the time , Ramzan Khan Rangeele and Mehboob Khan Darasapiya .
The young Alladiya Khan was closely associated with Wazir Khan binkar at Indore and Bombay .
The Meend of his gayaki can be traced to this influence .
Today , only the Khayal tradition remains .
He was known to have been greatly influenced by Utd .
Mubarak Khans style that blended the Swar and Taal aspects of khayal singing for the first time .
Most gharanas apply notes in simple succession in aalap and taan , whereas in the Jaipur gayaki , notes are applied in an oblique manner with filigree involving immediately neighboring notes .
Instead of the flat taan , gamak makes the taan spiral into seemingly never-ending cycles .
Meend in aalap and gamak in taan are the hallmark of this gayaki .
To his immense credit , the great exponent of Kirana gharana , Bhimsen Joshi is one of the very few singers outside the Jaipur gharana , who has adopted the gamak taan to an extent , complete with long , uninterrupted patterns clearly showing an amazing breath capacity much like the old masters of Jaipur gharana , but he has not quite achieved the intricacy and grace of gamak that is the signature of Jaipur .
Sharp edged harkats and murkis are relatively uncommon .
Not only are the notes sung in rhythm with the taal but progress between the matras is in fractions of quarters and one-eighths .
While being mindful of so many factors , musicians of this gharana still have a graceful way of arriving at the Sam without having matras to spare !
This is particularly evident in the way bol-alaap or bol-taan is sung , where meticulous attention is given to the short and long vowels in the words of the bandish that are being pronounced , and the strict discipline of avoiding unnatural breaks in the words and in the meaning of the lyrics .
No other gharana has paid so much attention to the esthetics and laykaari in singing bol-alaaps and bol-taans .
A highlight of Jaipur gayaki is the mastery over Jod Raags .
Singers from other Gharanas tend to sing one Raag in Aaroh and the other in Avaroh .
Some others sing one Raag in the lower half of the octave and then switch to the other Raag in the upper half .
Alternatively , they may sing alternate phrases of the two component Raags .
In Jaipur Gayaki , there is such perfect fusion of the two raags that it sounds like a homogeneous Raag in its own right , giving the feel of both component raags , not as a heterogeneous mixture cobbled together .
The listener hears an amalgam of both raags without losing their distinctive identity .
Alladiya Khan introduced many lesser-known or obscure raags in his repertoire like Raag Basanti Kedar , Raag Jait Kalyan , Raag Kafi Kanada , Raisa Kanada , Raag Basanti Kanada , Raag Savani Nat , Raag Savani Kalyan , Raag Bhoop Nat , Raag Nat Kamod , Raag Bihari , Raag Khat , Raag Khokar , Raag Sampoorna Malkauns , and many others .
Trying to imbibe all these characteristics without losing the aesthetics is a tall order for any musician .
Hence this Gayaki is called a thinking listeners or connoisseurs Gayaki .
However , it gives equal pleasure to the uninitiated listener who may not understand the technical intricacies , but responds to the layakari and the melodic content of the presentation .
The Gharana purity of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana has been an avid discussion topic among connoisseurs and scholars alike , as a result of Utd .
Alladiya Khan purposefully teaching students to approach the same musical content differently , causing internal quarrels within the Gharana itself , as well .
For instance , the approach to certain Raags conflict between branches of the Gharana , as certain elements of a Raag are neglected , emphasized , de-emphasized or treated differently .
As a result , scholars feel the purity of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana can be traced from Utd .
Alladiya Khan to his brother Utd .
Haider Ali Khan , to his sons Utd .
Manji Khan and Utd .
Bhurji Khan and his grandson Ut Azizuddin Khan , as well as Utd .
Gulubhai Jasdanwalla , the only purist outside of the Utd .

Emily Robison is an American songwriter , singer , multi-instrumentalist , and a founding member of the female country band the Dixie Chicks .
Robison plays banjo , dobro , guitar , bass , mandolin , accordion , and sitar .
Initially in her career with the Dixie Chicks , she limited her singing to harmony with backing vocals , but within her role in the Court Yard Hounds , she has taken on the role of lead vocalist .
Emily Erwin was born in Pittsfield , Massachusetts .
Parents Paul Erwin and Barbara Trask moved the family to the northern suburban town of Addison , Texas on the edge of Dallas , where she was raised with her two older sisters , Julia and Martha .
Her parents were both educators and nurtured the growing interest that both Emily and Martha shared , and together both sisters became proficient on several instruments while in elementary school .
Emily began playing the violin at age seven , and the banjo at age ten , afterward learning all the string instruments she could find .
Years later , Martie joked that Emily was better than she at the fiddle , and because she wanted to keep the fiddle as her instrument , she forced Emily to learn something else .
Emily responded by mastering the five string banjo , by reading books to teach herself the chord progressions .
From 1984-1989 , Jane Frost , , remembers watching the sisters mature , teaming up with schoolmates Troy and Sharon Gilchrist .
The foursome were touring in a teenage bluegrass group they named the Blue Night Express , in part because of the amount of travelling they had to do to reach far away festivals , frequently with a parent or friend of the family towing them back home long after dark at night .
They thought it was worth the sacrifices to meet their musical heroes and experienced the friendly camaraderie and tricks of the trade on instruments from others .
The sisters were said to have an almost obsessive interest in busking at small venues and attending bluegrass festivals .
After Martie graduated from secondary school at Greenhill School with Emily still completing her studies , both remained active in the bluegrass scene .
In 1989 , after years of attending bluegrass festivals and busking where they could , Emily joined her sister Martie , guitarist Robin Lynn Macy , and upright bass player Laura Lynch .
Frost , again , recalls being privy to the discussion that the four women had about the possibility of a successful career as musicians together .
Martie felt they could do well .
Robin said , .

Its going to be a hot band , to which Emily responded , I give it six months , and if we arent making money by then , Im out of here !

Robison was shy , and the youngest member of the group .
She had enjoyed playing throughout school , but was at an age where she was already entertaining thoughts of working hard to be accepted by the United States Air Force Academy .
By 1993 , the band had evolved into a new direction .
Macy left the group for a purer bluegrass sound .
Lynch , thrust into the position of sole lead singer , was replaced by the sisters in 1995 with singer composer Natalie Maines after the group was unable to garner anything more than local interest .
Robison commented , We were prepared to pay our dues for as long as it took ; we were prepared for longevity .
We know that we will always be playing music together , so we wanted to find someone who is just as determined and energetic as we are .
But in later interviews , the sisters revealed what many had thought for a long time : the reason Lynch was replaced was not commitment but a perceived lack of talent .
In an article in the April/May edition of Country Music Magazine , Emily stated , We felt we needed the next calibre of singer .
From there , massive commercial success ensued , with their 1998 and 1999 albums Wide Open Spaces and Fly both achieving diamond record status .
Robison was a key element of the groups look , with her hair dyed blond to match the other two at first , and then allowing it to return to her natural brunette color , and distinguishing herself visually from the other two .
Robison and Maguires instrumental virtuosity set the Chicks apart from many other country acts , male and female .
Robisons songwriting has also been a factor in the Chicks recording career .
Robison stood by Maines when the controversy over Maines remarks about U.S. President George W. Bush hit the newswire on the eve before the Iraq War in 2003 .
She was the only bandmate to realize that , while in the U.K. , there was a big anti-war sentiment in the audience , but that back in the United States , Maines criticism of President Bush would not be well received .
Nevertheless , even when her home was trashed , and plenty of editorials were predicting the end of the Dixie Chicks successful careers in music , she remained loyal to Maines , as did her sister .
Robison spent at least half of her life busking and touring nearly non-stop since high school , first with her older sister , and then with the changing lineups of the Dixie Chicks .
After the bandmates celebrated their five Grammy Awards for Taking the Long Way , the trio all had young children and took time out to spend with them , but Robison was eager to return to writing and touring .
When Robisons marriage came to an end , she began expressing herself by songwriting .
Some of her compositions include her feelings about the breakup with her former husband , and expected that soon , the band would resume its former schedule of writing and performing , but Natalie Maines was reluctant to do so .
After four years , Robison became angry and frustrated , and in sending her new songs to her sister , conveyed her increasing disappointment .
With Natalie Maines taking a break from music , Rolling Stone magazine announced in January 2010 that Emily and sister Martie have formed a side project called the Court Yard Hounds , with Robison as lead vocalist .
The band made their live debut in March at South by Southwest with an album released in May , 2010 .
Robison wrote all but one of the songs on their album .
On May 1 , 1999 , Emily married country singer Charlie Robison .
Martie later revealed on a VH-1 program that during their courtship , she had written the romantic hit song , Cowboy Take Me Away for them .
The Robisons have three children : Charles Augustus , called Gus , born November 11 , 2002 and twins Julianna Tex and Henry Benjamin born on April 14 , 2005 .
Emily and Charlie divorced on August 6 , 2008 after nine years of marriage .
Robison and her then-boyfriend , Martin Strayer , have a daughter , Violet Isabel Strayer , born on September 4 , 2012 .
Robison and Strayer are now married
Chhote Rahimat Khan , is a Hindustani classical sitar player of the Bande Ali Khan Gharana , taught by his father , Abdul Karim Khan , and grandfather , Ratna Rahimat Khan , as well as his older brothers .
Belonging to the seventh generation of musicians from Dharwad , Gwalior , he received the majority of his training from his father , Ustad Abdul Karim Khan , although he has also benefited from the influence of his legendary grandfather , Sitar Ratna Rahimat Khan .
Ratna Rahimat Khan , a disciple of the great master , Ustad Bande Ali Khan , was a rudra vina and sitar player who was responsible not only for modifiying the three-string sitar to the seven-string instrument that we have today , but also for reunifying the instrumental khyal of the Gwalior gharana with the instrumental dhrupad of Gwalior .
It is this inimitable legacy that gives his music a unique and distinctive colour , rarely experienced in modern music circles .
His music is a sonorous blend of both Gayaki Ang , which aims to imitate the tonal nuance of the human voice on the instrument , and Tantakari Ang , the more traditional instrumental style played on the instrument .
He secured second prize in the All India Radio Music Competition held in Dharwad in 1978 , at the age of 19 , and also won the first award in the preliminary and final round of the Yuva Sangeet Nrithya Mahotsav organized by the South Central Zone Cultural Centre at Nagpur on 6 October 1987 .
He is a regular artist on AIR Dharwad and AIR Panaji , Goa .
He is also a music director .

Alhaiya Bilaval is a Hindustani classical raga .
Its the most commonly performed raga of the large Bilawal group , which mainly includes ragas based on the western major scale .
It is often simply referred to as Bilawal , although in the 17th century Alhaiya and Bilawal may have been separate ragas .
Writing about the musical theory of Indian classical music is fraught with complications .
First of all , there have been no set , formal methods of written notation .
Indian music is an aural tradition , and therefore writing is not an essential part of attaining talim .
Related ragas : Bilawal , Shuddha Bilawal , Devgiri Bilawal , Shukla Bilawal , Kakubh Bilawal .
Behavior refers to practical aspects of the music .
It is complicated to talk about this for Hindustani music since many of the concepts are fluid , changing , or archaic .
The following information can not be accurate , but it can attempt to reflect how the music existed .

Sadolikar was born 1951 into a family from Kolhapur which was known for its musical tradition and owning sugar mills .
She received training in Indian classical music from childhood .
Her initial training was given by her father , Wamanrao Sadolikar , who was taught by the founder of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana , Alladiya Khan , and his son Bhurji Khan .
Following her studies with her father , Sadolikar learnt music for twelve years from Gulubhai Jasdanwala , who was known for his large collection of raga compositions , including compositions in rare ragas .

Zia Mohiuddin Dagar , popularly known as Z. M. Dagar , was a North Indian classical musician , one of the 19th generation of Dagar family dhrupad musicians .
He was largely responsible for the revival of the rudra vina as a solo concert instrument .
Z. M. Dagar was born in the town of Udaipur , Rajasthan and began musical study with his father , Ustad Ziauddin Khan Dagar , court musician for the Maharana of Udaipur .
He was trained both in vocals and in the rudra veena , an instrument used by vocalists to practice melodies .
The veena was traditionally not played in public , but the young Zia Mohiuddin adopted it as his primary instrument , giving his first recital at age 16 .
Although he was discouraged by his father from experimenting with the structure of the veena , he nevertheless modified the instrument after his fathers death to better equip it for solo performance , transforming it into a larger bass instrument : With the help of the instrument house Kanailal & Brother , he enlarged the tumbas and dhandhi to create greater resonance and to allow the notes to sustain longer and so better reproduce the techniques used in dhrupad singing .
Because of these modifications , the instrument was too heavy to be held in the standard Northern posture , so he played instead in the Southern posture , with one tumba on the ground and one on the left knee .
After India gained independence the princely states were abolished .
The Dagar family lost the patronage of the court of Udaipur , and had to seek employment elsewhere .
Finally they arrived in Mumbai .
For 25 years they had to make ends meet by working in garages , selling bread , and rarely , playing instruments for movie scores .
They did not have a tanpura , sitar , or veena , let alone a house .
There was much cynicism about dhrupad , as his son Bahauddin Mohiuddin Dagar recounted in an interview .
Dhrupad ?
Wholl listen ?
Rudra veena ?
Play something else .
Long alaaps ?
So boring !

Z. M. Dagar was known particularly for his slow development of ragas , typically performed only with tanpura accompaniment , and for his meticulous attention to microtonal inflections .
He was very active in the West , associating himself with the American Society for Eastern Arts in Berkeley , California and with Wesleyan University , Rotterdam Music Conservatory , and the University of Washington , Seattle , where he was a visiting professor .
In 1990 , Ustad ji was awarded the Kalidas Samman , one of Indias most prestigious awards , by the Madhya Pradesh government .
He also received the Sangeet Natak Academi Award , the Rajasthan Sangeet Natak Academi award , and the Maharana Kumbha award , to name a few .
His younger brother , Ustad Zia Fariddudin Dagar , is a vocalist and teacher , and his son , Bahauddin Mohiuddin Dagar , is a vina player .
The concept of making a Gurukul was entirely Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagars .
He envisioned a place where he would sit with his disciple and .
impart training in the Guru Shishya Parampara a method in which a few selected students study under one roof whilst staying with the guru .
Ustad sahib put at least twenty years of his time and effort to give shape to this idea on his own and thus , the Gurukul came into being in 1982 at Palaspa - a village near Panvel - Mumbai

Raga Bhoopeshwari is a rare Hindustani Classical Raga .
The Raga in not one of the traditional ragas of Hindustani Classical Music being sung for the past few centuries .
It has been developed within the last few decades .
The birth of this raga is something that eluded most people for a while .
It was believed that the raga was created by Ustad Alladiya Khan of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana .
However the time frame of Ustadjis lifetime and the ragas emergence do not match .
It is now however certain , that the raga was created by Pt .
Mani Prasad of the Kirana Gharana .
Apart from who created the raga , a major issue that arises is , how was it created ?
Being an audav raga , Raga Bhoopeshwari leads to a lot of ambiguity .
Since the remaining notes/swars are unknown , it is quite difficult to determine the parent raga or scale of Bhoopeshwari .
The raga does not fit into any of Bhatkhande s thats and so its origin is uncertain .
A similar problem persists in Carnatic Music as well .
People associate it with the Melakarta Chakravam , Melakart Mararanjani , Melakarta Charukesi and even Melakarta Sarasangi , but no one is absolutely certain .
Another matter of concern with the raga is its name .
The name Bhoopeshwari had an obvious inspiration from Raga Bhopali .
However , the raga has various names across India .
Pt .
Hariprasad Chaurasia , the legendary flutist , prefers the name Raga Bhoopkali , while most of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana musicians use Raga Prateeksha .
Other variations such as Bhoopeshri , Bhoopshri etc. are also present .
In Carnatic Music , the raga is called Raga Vaasanthi .
Despite its complex origin and nomenclature , the raga isnt a very difficult one to sing .
It has the same notes as Raga Bhopali / Deshkar , but instead of the shuddha Dha , uses a komal Dha .
The Raga is a morning raga .
Its designated time is the second prahar of the morning , from 6-9 a.m. Possibly due to its recent creation , the raga has not been performed very widely .
However , it has started being used in film music , light classcial music and ghazals .
Some of the most notable performances of Raga Bhoopeshwari are :

Rupak Tala is a popular tala in Hindustani music that is common in Bhajans and Geets .
It has seven matras in three vibhags .
Unlike the popular Tintal , the vibhags of Rupak Tala are not of equal length .
Also , both the khali and taali of Rupak Tala fall on the first matra .
The aavaratan of Rupak Tala has three vibhags .
The first vibhag has three matras and both the second and third vibhags have two matras .
Sam is on the first matra of the first vibhag .
The aavaratan of Rupak Tala may be written as follows : .
It is important to note that the empty cells in the above table at the end of vibhags two and three are not rests .
Each number is a whole matra of equal length .
Using the Clap & Wave system can be problematic for Rupak Tala .
Traditionally one claps on sam , or taali , and waves on khali .
The first matra of Rupak Tala , however , is both taali and khali .
If the clap were to be present on sam then Rupak Tala may be confused for a similar tala of seven matras , Tivra Tala , that has identical vibhags but differs in that the first matra is taali .
There a numerous examples of Rupak Tala that differ based upon the instrument used .
The following examples apply for the tabla .
The most common theka for Rupak tala contains the bols Tin , Na , and Dhin .
This theka is composed in the following manner by gautam dayal .
Prakars are fairly open to the individual performers flair .
That being said , however , the following is an example of three common Rupak Tala prakars .
A tihai for Rupak Tala must begin on either the third or the sixth matra to end on sam .
The following is an example of a simple tihai for Rupak Tala that begins on matra three

She also had roles in several films , including Federico Fellini s La Dolce Vita and Andy Warhol s Chelsea Girls , as herself .
Nico died in July 1988 , as a result of a heart attack while vacationing on Ibiza in the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Spain with her son .
Nico was born Christa Paffgen in Cologne .
When she was two years old , she moved with her mother and grandfather to the Spreewald forest outside of Berlin .
Her father was enlisted as a soldier during World War II , and sustained head injuries that caused severe brain damage ; he was variously said to have died in a concentration camp , or to have faded away as a result of the shellshock he suffered .
In 1946 , Nico and her mother relocated to downtown Berlin , where Nico worked as a seamstress .
She attended school until the age 13 , and began selling lingerie in the exclusive department store KaDeWe , eventually getting modeling jobs in Berlin .
At five feet ten inches and with chiseled features and porcelain skin , Nico rose to prominence as a fashion model as a teenager .
According to conflicting accounts , Nico was raped by a member of the U.S. Air Force when she was 15 .
Nicos song Secret Side from the album The End makes oblique references to the rape .
Discovered at 16 by photographer Herbert Tobias while both were working at a KaDeWe fashion show in Berlin , Tobias christened Nico with her adopted name , which she used for most of her life .
Tobias named her this after his friend , filmmaker Nikos Papatakis .

In 1962 , Nico gave birth to her son , Christian Aaron Ari Paffgen , commonly held to have been fathered by French actor Alain Delon .
Delon always denied his paternity .
The child was raised mostly by Delons mother and her husband and eventually was adopted by them , taking their surname , Boulogne .
Nico 's first performances as a singer took place in December 1963 at New York 's Blue Angel nightclub , where she sang standards such as My Funny Valentine .

The group became the centerpiece of Warhols Exploding Plastic Inevitable , a multimedia performance featuring music , light , film and dance .
Nico sang lead vocals on three songs and backing vocal on Sunday Morning , on the bands debut album , The Velvet Underground & Nico .
Nicos tenure in the Velvet Underground was marked by personal and musical difficulties .
Violist and bassist John Cale has written that Nicos long preparations in the dressing room and pre-performance good luck ritual would often hold up a performance , which especially irritated band member Lou Reed .
Nicos partial deafness also would sometimes cause her to veer off key , for which she was ridiculed by other band members .
The album went on to become timeless in legend .
It scored # 13 on Rolling Stone s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time , though it was poorly received at the time of its release .
Immediately following her musical work with The Velvet Underground , Nico began work as a solo artist , performing regularly at The Dom in New York City .
At these shows , Nico was accompanied by a revolving cast of guitarists , including members of The Velvet Underground , Tim Hardin , Tim Buckley , Ramblin Jack Elliott and Jackson Browne .
For her debut album , 1967s Chelsea Girl , she recorded songs by Bob Dylan , Tim Hardin and Jackson Browne , among others .
Velvet Underground members Lou Reed , John Cale and Sterling Morrison contributed to the album , with Nico , Reed and Cale co-writing one song , It Was a Pleasure Then .
Chelsea Girl is a traditional chamber-folk album , which influenced artists such as Leonard Cohen , with strings and flute arrangements by producer Tom Wilson .
Nico was not satisfied with the album and had little say in production matters .
In retrospect , she said in 1981 : I still can not listen to it , because everything I wanted for that record , they took it away .
I asked for drums , they said no .
I asked for more guitars , they said no .
And I asked for simplicity , and they covered it in flutes !
They added strings , and -- I didnt like them , but I could live with them .
But the flute !
The first time I heard the album , I cried and it was all because of the flute .

Punjab Gharana , is a style and technique of Tabla playing that originated in the Punjab region of what is now split in present day Pakistan and India .
The Punjab Gharana is one of the six Tabla Gharanas .
Initially a pakhawaj-playing gharana , the Punjab school was created in the nineteenth century .
There is debate as to who precisely set up the Gharana .
Some believe it was Lala Bhavanidas .
And others claim that the founder was Lala Bhavanidass follower , Mian Qadir Baksh I .
Yet others are of the view that it was Saddu Hussain Baksh , follower of Qadir Baksh I who founded it .
Around the turn of the 20th century , Fakir Baksh , disciple of Saddu Hussain Baksh was the foremost advocate .
He was essentially a Pakhawaj player but certainly the first to introduce Tabla in this Gharana .
His disciples were his son Qadir Baksh II besides many like Baba Malang , and Feroze Khan of Lahore .
Jnan Prakash Ghosh of Farukhabad gharana also studied with Feroze Khan .
Qadir Baksh II was the teacher of the most renowned tabla player of 20th century , Ustad Alla Rakha , besides Ustad Allah Ditta and Mia Shaukat Hussain and Tafo Khan .
Ustad Alla Rakhas brilliant son , Ustad Zakir Hussain grew into a world renowned iconic figure of Tabla .
A legendary name , Mia Qadir Bakhsh was the authoritative head or Khalifa of the Punjab Gharana .
Teacher of internationally renowned maestro Ustad Allah Rakha and several others like Ustad Allah Ditta and Mia Shaukat Hussain .
An adept Pakhawaj player , Mia Qadir Baksh was noted for his layakari and reputation as a dedicated teacher .
Towards the end of his life he became a highly eccentric faqir .
After his death the khalifa-ship of the Punjab gharana passed to his nephew Khalifa Akhtar Hussain .
Teachers : Mian Qadir Bukhsh , Ustad Mashooqay Khan and Ustad Aslam Khan .
The last recognised khalifa of the Punjab tradition , Akhtar Hussain was respected for his knowledge over the traditional solo repertoire of Punjab .
Allarakha Khan was one of the most famous and widely recorded tabla players of the twentieth century.For tabla , .

Ustad Allarakha was such an artist , having brought his instrument a stature and respect never before enjoyed .
He moved from Lahore to Bombay in the late 1940s and took full advantage of the opportunity to be in the public eye when Ravi Shankar retained him as his regular touring accompanist from around 1962 onwards .
What he lacked in beauty of tone Allarakha more than made up for with the most magically intuitive and natural sense of rhythm - an ability to play outside the beat while always remaining entirely cognizant of it .
Rakha popularized the art of tabla , playing across the globe , elevating the status and respect of his instrument .
Abbaji also bridged the gap between Carnatic music and Hindustani music by playing with both renowned Carnatic musicians and other Hindustani stalwarts .
Leading American percussionists in Rock n Roll , such as the Grateful Deads Mickey Hart , admired him and studied his technique , benefiting greatly even from single meetings .
Hart , a published authority on percussion in world music , said Allarakha is the Einstein , the Picasso ; he is the highest form of rhythmic development on this planet .
Rakha also collaborated with Jazz master Buddy Rich , recording an album together in 1968 .
His consistently brilliant performances made the tabla a familiar percussion instrument the world over .
In 1985 , he founded the Ustad Allarakha Institute of Music to train young tabla players in the tradition of the Punjab gharana .
Ustad Allarakha died on February 3 , 2000 , truly one of the most pivotal and influential artists to have emerged from India in our time .
Ustad Shaukat Hussain Khan ranked amongst the finest musicians of South Asia .
Apart from his prowess over the solo repertoire , the maestro 's forte was his impeccable accompaniment .
Shaukat Hussain Khan was the accompanist of choice for Pakistans great vocalists and instrumentalists , and he always offered impeccable support .
As a soloist one hears the Delhi roots of his sound mixed with a truly Panjabi sense of rhythmic complexity .
One can hear this complexity in the varied internal phrase lengths of pieces and in the taal structures .
Now after the death of Miyan Shaukat Hussain Khan Sahib , his nephew , Ustad Shahid Khan became a Khalifa of the Punjab Gharana in Pakistan .
The renowned Tafo Khan is recognised for his matchless tayyari .
His solo performances are characterised by his dazzling prowess over difficult bols and charismatic stage presence .
Hailing from a traditional Rababi family , Tari Khan learned under Shaukat Hussain Khan in Lahore and became famous as the accompanist of the ghazal singer Ghulam Ali .
Tari always provided an exquisite accompaniment : clean , crisp thekas with astonishingly quick and interesting laggis to punctuate the verses .
Because of that international exposure , musicians in India got to hear of him at a time when little cultural news escaped from Pakistan , and most were impressed with this show of virtuosity .
Since then , Tari has gone on to international fame as a tabla showman .
His International Kherwa was a popular item .
Zakir Hussain is easily the most famous and influential tabla player of the modern age .
Ustad Zakir Hussain , more than a brilliant tabla player - he is a musical phenomenon who has changed the way we think about the tabla and the musicians who play it .
It is difficult to think of anyone else in the world who has made an instrument -LSB- tabla . -RSB-
such a lovable one ... The son of Allarakha Khan , he endeared himself to the world as a most sensitive and responsive accompanist , a dazzling soloist , and an adventurous fusion player .
Hussain was a child prodigy , and was touring by the age of twelve .
He went to the United States in 1970 , embarking on an international career which includes more than 160 concert dates a year .
He has composed and recorded many albums and soundtracks , and has received widespread recognition as a composer for his many ensembles and collaborations .
Ustad Zakir Hussain .
in 2010 , in a ceremony graced by Indian classical music luminaries ranging from Pt Shiv Kumar Sharma to Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia , tabla maestro Ustad Zakir Hussain was acclaimed as the Guru of Punjab Gharana .
Under the guidance of his Guru and father , tabla maestro Ustad Alla Rakha , and with the inspiration drawn from his brother , Ustad Zakir Hussain , Fazal has developed a unique style that is distinguished for its fine sense of rhythm , versatility and eloquence .
Fazal has expanded his horizons by being involved with other styles of music of the world especially Jazz and Western classical music , and has performed with many well known Jazz musicians .
For the last 16 years he has been associated with Mynta , his world music band based in Sweden .
They have performed all over the world and have released six immensely popular albums .
A disciple of the great Allarakha Khan , Yogesh has made a reputation for himself as an intelligent and supportive accompanist .
His understanding of vocal aesthetics and performance structure come , no doubt , from his early exposure to vocal music through his father , the marvellous Dinkar Kaikini of the Agra gharana .
From an early age he found himself recording with stalwarts such as K.G. Ginde : one recalls the films made about the various khayal gharanas , and Yogeshs appearance with Ginde in the Agra film .

A that is a mode in northern Indian or Hindustani music .
Thats always have seven different pitches and are a basis for the organization and classification of ragas in North Indian classical music .
The modern that system was created by Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande in the early decades of the twentieth century .
Bhatkhande modeled his system after the Carnatic melakarta classification , devised around 1640 A.D. by the musicologist Venkatamakhin .
Bhatkhande visited many of the gharanas of North Indian classical music , conducting a detailed analysis of Indian raga .
His research led him to a system of ten thats , each named after a prominent raga associated with it .
Many correspond to one or other of the European church modes .
They are listed here according to their pitches ; lower-frequency pitches are represented with lowercase letters and higher-frequency pitches with uppercase letters .
One can arbitrarily designate any pitch as Sa and build the series from there .
While all thats contain seven notes , many ragas contain fewer than seven and some use more .
A raga need not use every swara in a given that ; the assignment is made according to whatever notes the raga does contain .
The relatively small number of thats reflects Bhatkhandes compromise between accuracy and efficiency : The degree of fit between a raga and its that is balanced with the desire to keep the number of basic thats small .
Ambiguities inevitably arise .
For example , Raga Hindol , assigned to Kalyan that , uses the notes S G M D N , which are also found in Marwa that .
Raga Jaijaivanti contains both shuddha nishad and komal nishad , which by definition corresponds to no that .
Bhatkande resolved such cases by an ad hoc consideration , appealing to musical performance practice .
Each that contains a different combination of altered and natural notes .
The flattening or sharpening of pitches always occurs with reference to the interval pattern in Bilawal that .
In effect only heptatonic diatonic scales are called that .
Bhatkhande applied the term that only to scales that fulfill the following rules : .
Ragas are normally ascribed to certain periods of the day and night .
Narada s Sangita-Makaranda , written sometime between 7th and 11th century , gives warnings to musicians against playing ragas at the incorrect time of day .
Traditionally , disastrous consequences are to be expected .
Bhatkhande stated that the correct time to play a raga had a relation to its that

Ustad Tari Khan was born in Lahore , Pakistan .
He hails from a traditional Rababi family .
His father was a classical vocalist .

Three years later he performed at the death anniversary of tabla master Mian Qadir Baksh .
That solo performance earned him a revered place amongst the tabla greats .
He became famous as the accompanist of the ghazal singer Ghulam Ali .
Tari always provided an exquisite accompaniment : clean , crisp thekas with astonishingly quick and interesting laggis to punctuate the verses .
Because of that international exposure , musicians in India got to hear of him at a time when little cultural news escaped from Pakistan .
Since then , Tari has gone on to musical scene as a tabla showman .
Ustad Tari Khan has accompanied various classical artistes like Pt Jasraj , etc. .

Ustad Rashid Khan is an Indian classical musician in the Hindustani music tradition .
He belongs to the Rampur-Sahaswan gharana , and is the great-grandson of gharana founder Inayat Hussain Khan .
He is married to Soma Khan .
In a story told in several versions , it appears that Pandit Bhimsen Joshi said at one point , that Rashid Khan was the assurance for the future of Indian vocal music .
He was awarded the Padma Shri , as well as the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 2006 and Padma Bhushan in 2013 .
Born in Badayun , Uttar Pradesh .
He received his initial training from his maternal grand-uncle , Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan .
He is also the nephew of Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan .
As a child he had little interest in music .
His uncle Ghulam Mustafa Khan was among the first to note his musical talents , and for some time trained him in Mumbai .
However , he received his main training from Nissar Hussain Khan , initially at his house in Badayun .
A strict disciplinarian , Nissar Hussain Khan would insist on voice training from four in the morning , and make Rashid practice one note of the scale for hours on end .
A whole day would be spent on practising just a single note .
Although Rashid detested these lessons as a child , but the disciplined training shows in his easy mastery of taan and layakaari today .
It was not until he was 18 that Rashid began to truly enjoy his musical training .
Rashid Khan gave his first concert at age eleven , and the following year , 1978 , he performed at an ITC concert in Delhi .
In April 1980 , when Nissar Hussain Khan moved to the ITC Sangeet Research Academy , Calcutta , Rashid Khan also joined the academy at the age of 14 .
By 1994 , he was acknowledged as a musician at the academy .
The Rampur-Sahaswan gayaki is closely related to the Gwalior gharana , which features medium-slow tempos , a full-throated voice and intricate rhythmic play .
Rashid Khan includes the slow elaboration in his vilambit khayals in the manner of his maternal grand-uncle and also developed exceptional expertise in the use of sargams and sargam taankari .
He is influenced with the style of Ustad Amir Khan and Pandit Bhimsen Joshi .
He is also a master of the tarana like his guru but sings them in his own manner , preferring the khayal style rather than the instrumental stroke-based style for which Nissar Hussain was famous .
There is no imitation of instrumental tone .
His mastery of all aspects tonal variations , dynamics and timbre adjustment leave very little to be desired in the realm of voice culture .
His renderings stand out for the emotional overtones in his melodic elaboration .
He says : The emotional content may be in the alaap , sometimes while singing the bandish , or while giving expression to the meaning of the lyrics .
This brings a touch of modernity to his style , as compared to the older maestros , who placed greater emphasis on impressive technique and skillful execution of difficult passages .
Rashid Khan has also experimented with fusing pure Hindustani music with lighter musical genres , e.g. in the Sufi fusion recording Naina Piya Se , or in experimental concerts with western instrumentalist Louis Banks .
He has also performed jugalbandis , along with sitarist Shahid Parvez and others

Bhairav , or Bhairon , is a raga in Hindustani classical music that was for centuries considered to be the most important raga .
Its modern form with an important komal rishabh is , however , very different from that described in the old texts .
Bhairav has its name from Bhairava , an incarnation of Shiva , and was historically associated with glory and awe , but became identified with peace and devotion .
Raga Bhairav is sometimes linked to raga Bhairavi via Bhairavis association with the consort of Bhairav of the same name ; Hijaz Bhairav is an example of this .
There are several allied ragas such as Ahir Bhairav , Bairagi , Gunkali , Hijaz Bhairav , Nat Bhairav , Ramkali , Jogiya and Kalingda .
This raga corresponds to Mayamalavagowla in Carnatic music .
Bhairon appears in the Sikh tradition from northern India and is part of the Guru Granth Sahib .
Every raga has a strict set of rules which govern the number of notes that can be used ; which notes can be used ; and their interplay that has to be adhered to for the composition of a tune .
In the Guru Granth Sahib , the Sikh holy Granth there are a total of 31 raga compositions and this raga is the twenty-fourth raga to appear in the series .
The composition in this raga appear on a total of 43 pages from page numbers 1125 to 1168 .
Bhairav was an important raga at the time of Guru Nanak and has continued to retain its significance and popularity .
Bhairav appears in the Ragmala as husband/wife of Bhairavi and four other raginis .
Today it is the head raga for one of the ten thatas .
The Raga Sagara , a journal of circa 8th century , describes this raga as awe-inspiring and as expressing the fulfilment of the desire to worship .
Mesakarna calls this morning melody of the autumn season one of awesome grandeur .
Performed before sunrise , this raga was used by Guru Nanak , Guru Amar Das , Guru Ram Das , and Guru Arjan for 99 hymns .
The vadis are performed with a slow , wide vibrato which may begin with the vadi itself or the highest limit to which it will extend .
In descent the vibrato must begin with upper limit .
Otherwise Bhairav has few characteristic phrases
Ektara is a one-string instrument most often used in traditional music from Bangladesh , India , Egypt , and Pakistan .
In origin the ektara was a regular string instrument of wandering bards and minstrels from India and is plucked with one finger .
The ektara usually has a stretched single string , an animal skin over a head and pole neck or split bamboo cane neck .
Pressing the two halves of the neck together loosens the string , thus lowering its pitch .
The modulation of the tone with each slight flexing of the neck gives the ektara its distinctive sound .
There are no markings or measurements to indicate what pressure will produce what note , so the pressure is adjusted by ear .
The various sizes of ektara are soprano , tenor , and bass .
The bass ektara , sometimes called a dotara often has two strings .
Yet another version is khamak , one-headed drum with a string attached to it which is plucked .
The only difference from ektara is that no bamboo is used to stretch the string , which is held by one hand , while being plucked by another .
These instruments are commonly used in kirtan chanting , which is a Hindu devotional practice of singing the divine names and mantras in an ecstatic call and response format .
Used by Sadhus , or wandering holy men .
Also , the ektara is used for Sufi chanting as well as by the Bauls of Bengal .
The dotara has been made popular in the United States by devotional kirtan wallahs , such as the Western sadhu Bhagavan Das , kirtan recording artist , and author of Its Here Now , Are You ?

Ektara is the most ancient form of stringed instrument found in the Eastern parts of India , the instrument family being scattered all over the country .
Though it has a humble tribal beginnings , it has been associated with and popularized by the ascetic and minstrel tradition of songs in Bengal .
A typical Bengali Ektara is constructed out of a half of a dried gourd shell serving as the sound-box , with a metal string running right through the middle of the shell ; at the top , the string is tied to a knob , which adjusts the tension the of the string and thereby , the tuning -- the knob and the string-tension is supported by two bamboo-strips , tied to two opposite sides of the gourd shell .
The playing style of this instrument is a simultaneous pluck and gong , matching the rhythm of the music .
The Ektara and the Ghati Baya , together form a complete set accompaniments , especially to Devotional and Deolati musical traditions .
The string , as in a Dotara , is tuned to the main/root note of the composition .
Nowadays the ektara is widely used by folk singers especially by Sufi singers in Punjab and Sindh .
Traditional and modern forms of bhangra sometimes use an ektara or tumbi to accompany the singer and dhol .
On the occasion of Urs held in memory of the renowned saint and mystic poet Hazrat Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai at Bhitshah , near Hyderabad in Sindh , held every year between 13th and 15th of Safar , devotees sing with fervor and frenzy his love-intoxicated Kafis to the strains of ektara which appears to be a very ancient musical instrument .
Mention may also be made here of the Dotar of Khorasan .
Nur-Mohammad Dorpur is a famous traditional Dotar player from the Khorasan region .
The renowned Kamancheh player Kayhan Kalhor who has performed at the famous Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles , also stresses the commonalities between the Indian and Persian musical traditions which are brought to a focus by instruments such as the Ektara and the Dotar
An electric sitar is a kind of electric guitar designed to mimic the sound of the traditional Indian instrument , the sitar .
Depending on the manufacturer and model , these instruments bear varying degrees of resemblance to the traditional sitar .
Most resemble the electric guitar in the style of the body and headstock , though some have a body shaped to resemble that of the sitar .
The instrument was developed in the late 1960s at Danelectro , when many western musical groups began to use the sitar .
The sitar is generally considered a difficult instrument to learn .
By contrast , the electric sitar , with its standard guitar fretboard and tuning , is a more familiar fret arrangement for a guitarist to play .
The twangy sitar like tone comes from a flat bridge adding the necessary buzz to the guitar strings .
In addition to the six playing strings , most electric sitars have sympathetic strings , typically located on the left side of the instrument .
These strings have their own pickups , and are usually tuned with a harp wrench .
A unique type of bridge , a buzz bridge , helps give the instrument its distinctive sound .
Some electric sitars have drone strings in lieu of sympathetic strings .
A few models , such as the Jerry Jones Baby sitar , lack both sympathetic and drone strings , while still retaining the distinctive buzz bridge .
The sympathetic strings on most electric sitars do not resonate strongly enough to match the effect of an acoustic sitar .
There are resonant chambers in the solidbody instruments that have Masonite tops , however it is not enough to excite the 13 strings into true sympathy .
The strings are tensioned over two rosewood bridges with fret material as saddles so the sound is more like an autoharp than a sitar .
Versions of the electric sitar were also developed mainly in India .
These are smaller sized sitars that look like a sitar .
These sitars are tuned the same way as the original classical sitar would be tuned .
Because the tone quality and playing technique differ significantly from that of the sitar , it is typically used in rock , jazz , and fusion styles .
Notable early hit singles featuring electric sitar include Eric Burdon and the Animals Monterey , Mana s Siembra el Amor , Joe South s Games People Play , Stevie Wonder s I Was Made to Love Her and Signed , Sealed , Delivered , B.J. Thomas Hooked on a Feeling , The Spinners Its a Shame , The Box Tops Cry Like a Baby as well as some sides by The Stylistics and The Delfonics .
Other recording artists who have featured the electric sitar include Steppenwolf , Mandrake Memorial , Kronos Quartet , Genesis -RRB- , Yes , The Clash , Todd Rundgren , Redbone , Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods Who Do You Think You Are ?
, The Grass Roots Glory Bound , Guns N Roses , Lenny Kravitz , Robbie Dupree Steal Away , Oasis , R.E.M , Metallica , Steely Dan , Santana , Roy Wood , Eric Johnson , Mystical Sun , Pearl Jam , Screaming Trees in Halo of Ashes , Redd Kross , Alice in Chains , Torsten de Winkel , Flower Travelin Band , Hiroshi Takano , Miyavi , Sugizo , hide , Kaoru of Dir en grey , Pat Metheny , Sigh , Steve Vai , Rory Gallagher , Mint Royale , Steve Miller , Van Halen , Tony Hicks of The Hollies , Schizo Da Maddcap , Rob Mastrianni .
Raagnagrok is a contemporary duo using electric sitar and electronic .
Vinnie Bell used the instrument on several songs , including Green Tambourine by The Lemon Pipers , Band of Gold by Freda Payne , and Shes a Heartbreaker by Gene Pitney .
The 1971 album Somethin Else recorded by Danny Davis and the Nashville Brass prominently featured an electric sitar , a first for the country music industry .
The instrument provided accompaniment on such songs as Snowbird , Rose Garden , Are You from Dixie ?
and others .
In 2010 , MGMT released their album Congratulations , where the electric sitar was played on many tracks by lead singer and guitarist Andrew VanWyngarden .
Blues musician Buddy Guy played , among other guitars , a Coral electric sitar in shows on his 2010 tour
Ajrara gharana or Ajrada gharana is one of the six main traditional schools in tabla drum .
This school was founded in the nineteenth century by Miru and Kallu , disciples of Sitab Khan of the Delhi gharana , at the Ajrara village , in Uttar Pradesh .
The Ajrada Gharana is traced to Kallu and Miru in the beginning of the 19th century .
Genealogy , They were disciples of Sitab Khan .
This Gharana is an offshoot of the Delhi Gharana .
The distinctiveness of this Gharana is the use of complex Bols and Meend .
Pakhawaj bols are rare .
The stress is on Ad and Barabar laya .
It specializes in the three-time pattern .
The position of the left drum is not changed , but its face is touched with the thumb .
Gheginak , gheghe , Dhadagena , Nadagena or Tadagena etc. are used in Qayadas .
Habibuddin Khan , Niazu Khan and Ramzan Khan , Manju Khan , Hasmat Ali Khan , Akram Khan http://akramkhantabla.in .
Clarity of sound is made possible by the propensity for using the index and middle fingers in the traditional manner .
The Ajrara gharana style includes bol patterns that are rather complicated , much more than does the Delhi gharana , and for the purpose the third fingers are brought into play as well .
Bols like Dhina gi na , Ghe Ghe Tit Kit , Dha Ge Na etc are most frequently used .
These bols create a certain resonance .
Pakhawaj bols are rarely encountered in this gharana .
Ajrada is most well known for its theme and various compositions as well as its beautiful and balanced Bayan work .
The Qaidas of Ajrada , often , have an additional third line out of four ; this is one of the few gifts of Ajrada to the tabla world .

According to well known musicologist Dr. Ashok Ranade who was a former Director of Music Centre , University of Bombay , There was no chink in his armour .
He was a frequent performer in the musical conferences and circles of Lucknow , Allahabad , Calcutta , Gwalior , Bombay and Mysore and in concerts organised by provincial princes who vied with one another to have the Ustad perform in their respective courts .
The rulers of Baroda held him in high esteem and he was offered the seat to the right of the Maharaja of Baroda during the official functions of the royal court.He also performed at Jorasanko Thakurbari , the residential abode of Rabindranath Tagore , who was an admirer of the Ustad .

His associate and relative and lifelong companion Ghulam Rasul accounts an incident in the 1930s when a thousand rupee currency note was found tucked in the pocket of his sherwani when it came home after being washed , cleansed , dried and ironed by the washerman .
When asked by Rasul , the Ustad retorted in utter innocence - How do I know that who is giving me what and how am I to know that a single currency note can be worth more than a hundred rupees ?
In another incident which took place at Unaon , near Kanpur , a few years later ; when the Ustad came to know that his patron was expending beyond his means to host the concert of the Ustad to celebrate the sacred thread ceremony of his son , Faiyaz Khan accepted only the fare for his return journey and blessed the child with a gold ring purchased from the local goldsmith during his afternoon stroll the day before .
Failing health due to a bout of typhoid in 1945 followed by tuberculosis restricted him to lower his pitch to B and B Flat though in his prime , he always sang in C Sharp and C .
The available recordings of the Ustad are almost entirely from his later years .
By the time he died , he had earned the reputation of being one of the greatest and most influential vocalists of the century .

The vichitra veena is a plucked string instrument used in Hindustani music .
It is similar to the Carnatic gottuvadhyam .
It has no frets and is played with a slide .
The Vichitra Veena is the modern form of ancient Ektantri Veena .
It is made of a broad , fretless , horizontal arm or crossbar around three feet long and six inches wide , with two large resonating gourds , which are inlaid with ivory and attached underneath at either end .
The narrow ends of the instrument are fashioned into peacock heads , the national bird of India .
There are four main playing strings and five secondary strings , which are played openly with the little finger for a drone effect .
Underneath them are 13 sympathetic strings tuned to the notes of the appropriate raag .
The veena has a five-octave range .
Two plectrums identical to those used for sitar are worn on the middle and index fingers of the right hand to pluck the strings , and a glass ball is moved with the left across the main strings to create melody .
Coconut oil is put on the strings to minimize the friction of the sliding hand holding the batta .
The veena was often used to accompany the Dhrupad style of singing and this did not allow for much intricacy or embellishment around the notes .
It was rescued from oblivion by Lalmani Misra who developed technique of playing and created Misrabani compositions ; his son Gopal Shankar Misra made the repertoire universal
Farukhabad gharana is one of six prominent playing styles or gharanas of North Indian tabla drums , in Hindustani classical music , and derives its name from Farukhabad in Uttar Pradesh state .
The Farukkabad gharana of tabla was created in the 11th Century by a Rajput Court musician Akaasa who later accepted and converted to Islam and became a Muslim .
He also changed his name from Akaasa to Mir Akaasa .
He was the first to introduce bols into tabla playing .
The first bols introduced in tabla were TAT-DHIT-THUN-NAN .
Mir Akaasa died in the year 1189 AD .
He was succeeded by nine sons and one daughter .
He passed on his legacy to his eldest son , Ustad Bilawal Khan , who in turn passed the torch of the gharana to Ustad Ali Bux .
This tradition continued till the 26th descendant , Ustad Haji Vilayat Ali Khan .
It was he who named this ` gharana ' after the province in which he used to live viz .
Farukkabad .
Ustad Haji Vilayat Ali Khan gave this gharana the name of the province where he used to live , which was Farukkabad .
Ustad Haji Vilayat Khan got the title of Haji after his completion of 7 haj .
Vilayat Khan got famous after his famous battle of Tabla gats with Ustad Salaali Khansaheb , who has challenged Ustad Bakshu Khansaheb of Lucknow gharana , In order to save his pride Bakshu Khansaheb requested Vilayat Khan , who was also Salaali Khansahebs uncle , to fight the battle of tabla Gats with Ustad Salaali Khansaheb .
This battle continued for almost 15 days where many gats and jodas were exchanged .
On the 15th day Vilayat Khan played a unique Gat whose joda Ustad Salari Khansaheb could not produce .
Thus Vilayat Khan was declared the winner .
Ustad Bakshu Khansaheb as a reward got Vilayat Khan married to his daughter and reputedly gave him 500 tabla compositions .
Vilayat Khan on the other hand gave Salaali Khansaheb his daughter in marriage and along with that he gave 14 authentic Gats known as jahezi gats to Ustad Salaali Khan as dowry .
The lineage of Farukkabad is still carried on by the descendants of This Gharana .
The Present Khalifa of this gharana is the great tabla exponent Ustad Sabir Khan who is the 33rd generation of this unbroken lineage and his sons Arif Khan , Asif Khan and Ameen Khan are the 34th descendant of this lineage .
There is a huge variety in the repertoire of compositions , owing to the tremendous and creative output of great composers such as Haji Vilayat Ali Khan and Amir Hussain Khan , nephew of Munir Khan , himself a disciple of Nisar Hussain Khan .
In addition , a large number of gats .
The Farukhabad Gharana is the oldest gharana of Tabla .
It was earlier know as the purbi Baj , or eastern style , which is characterized by an extensive use of resonant strokes played on the sur of the daya .

Annapurna Devi , born Roshanara Khan -RRB- on 23 April 1927 , is an Indian surbahar player of Hindustani Classical Music .
She is the daughter and disciple of Allauddin Khan , the founder of Maihar gharana , and was married to sitar maestro Ravi Shankar , also one of her fathers disciples from 1941 to 1962 .
After her divorce , she never performed in public , moved to Mumbai , became a recluse and started teaching .
Over the years she has had notable disciples : Hariprasad Chaurasia , Nikhil Banerjee , Amit Bhattacharya and Suresh Vyas .
Annapurna Devi was born on the occasion of chaiti purnima , 23 April 1927 at Maihar , a small princely state of British India , where her father Alauddin Khan was a royal court musician at the court of Maharaja Brijnath Singh , who named the newborn girl Annapurna .
Devis father and guru Alauddin Khan , founder of the Senia Maihar gharana or Senia Maihar School of Hindustani classical music , was a noted musician and guru of Indian classical music .
Her uncles , Fakir Aftabuddin Khan and Ayet Ali Khan , were noted musicians at their native place Shibpur , in the present-day Bangladesh .
Her brother Ali Akbar Khan was a legendary Sarod maestro and was considered a national living treasure in India and the USA .
Her former husband , virtuoso Sitar maestro Ravi Shankar , was perhaps the most famous Indian classical musician internationally .
Annapurna Devi became a very accomplished Surbahar player of the Maihar gharana within a few years of starting to take music lessons from her father , and started guiding many of her fathers disciples , Nikhil Banerjee and Bahadur Khan -RRB- in classical music as well as in the techniques and intricacies of instrumental performances .
Meanwhile , Alauddin Khan s Sitar student Ravi Shankar married Annapurna .

The marriage between Ravi Shankar and Annapurna Devi took place when Ravi was 21 years and Annapurna was only 14 years old .
She converted to Hinduism upon marriage .
The marriage lasted more than two decades , and she gave birth to a son , Shubhendra Shankar , whom Annapurna Devi trained in Sitar .
Shubhendra Shankar had rigorous training in Sitar under the tutelage of his mother .
His father , however , chose to interrupt his musical talim or training and , instead brought him to the United States .
Shubhendra died at an early age , after a marriage and the birth of three children .
Shubhendra did not have a solo career in classical music , but did very occasionally accompany his illustrious father Ravi Shankar in concerts in the USA and abroad .
In the 1950s , both Ravi Shankar and Annapurna Devi performed duets in Delhi and Calcutta , principally at the college of her brother , Ali Akbar Khan .
But later , Shankar started getting insecure since she used to be applauded in concerts more than he was and she thereafter decided not to perform publicly .
Even the movie Abhimaan is believed to be based on the same scenario .
Annapurna Devi was already a master of the Surbhahar when Ravi Shankar came to study with her father , Alauddin Khan , in the court of Maihar , India .
Notable mentions among her students would be her nephew Sarod maestro Aashish Khan Debsharma ; Biren Banerjee of Howrah also received training from her ; renowned flautists Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia and Nityanand Haldipur ; Sitarists Pandit Nikhil Banerjee received training from her , Chandrakant Sardeshmukh , Sudhir Phadke from Pune , Dr. Hemant Desai , and Professor Rooshikumar Pandya ; and Sarodists Pradeep Barot , Amit Bhattacharya and Basant Kabra .
The list of other occasional students includes Sandhya Apte , Leenata Vaze , Amit Hiren Roy , Stuti Dey , Uma Guha , Milind Sheorey , and Kokila Rai , wife of the late Vasant Rai .
All of them carry on the legacies of Annapurna Devis , and thus Alauddin Khans , music through their recitals .
She is also the key figure of Acharya Alauddin Music Circle , in Mumbai .
Though she refrained from taking music as her profession , she received utmost reverence in all circles of Indian classical music especially for her unending repertoire in Indian classical music , and her traditional dhrupadi approach to music .
She has received some of the most distinguished musical and civilian honours of India .
She is the recipient of , among many , the Padma Bhushan in 1977 ; and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1991 ; and the Deshikottam which is an honorary doctorate degree by Nobel laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore s Visva-Bharati University in 1999 .
In the year 2004 , the Sangeet Natak Akademi , the Government of Indias highest organisation for promoting music and other fine arts , has appointed her a Ratna or jewel fellow .
She has not recorded any music albums .
But some of her performances that have been secretly taped from her earlier concerts , are non-commercially available among a percentage of music lovers in India .
In spite of her avoidance of media-limelight , she continues to be thought of as a classical instrumentalist of the highest calibre in India
Iqbal Hussain Qureshi , best known as I.H. Qureshi , was a Pakistani nuclear chemist and professor of chemistry at the Institute of and Applied Sciences in Islamabad .
Qureshi was the principle contributor of scientific understanding of various elements : rubidium , potassium , bromide , chlorine , and the Debye model .
Early his career , he made notable contribution in advancing of the field of nuclear medicine in Pakistan .
In addition , he also advised the government on nuclear policy issues and pushed his influential role in Nuclear Regulatory Authority and the peaceful applications of nuclear science .
He spent most of his career as an educator and research scientist at the Pakistan Institute of and Applied Sciences .
Iqbal Hussain Qureshi was born in Ajmer , Rajasthan , British Indian Empire on 27 September 1937 .
After the partition of India in 1947 , his family moved to Hyderabad , Sindh , where he matriculated from a public high school .
He was a child prodigy , having accepted at the Sindh University in his teenage years to study chemistry .
He received BSc in Chemistry from Sindh University in 1956 .
He graduated at the top of his class , wining the Silver Medal with his degree .
In 1958 , he gained MSc in chemistry from the same institution , and and won the scholarship to pursue higher education in chemistry abroad .
He went to United States to attend the University of Michigan where he earned MSc in nuclear chemistry in 1962 .
Qureshi continued his research on nuclear chemistry and took the PhD in nuclear chemistry from the University of Tokyo , with with a doctoral thesis on the Radiochemical separations by Amalgam exchange which contained fundamental work on chemical amalgam , in 1963 .
In 1967 , he availed a post doctoral position at U.S. s National Bureau of Standards and during 1969 he obtained a specialized training in the area of uranium and plutonium separation from Denmark .
In 1960 , Qureshi joined the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and posted at the chemistry division working under nuclear physicist , dr. Naeem Ahmad Khan .
However , he was separated from the division when he independently established the radiochemistry division there .
In 1967 , he took up the professorship at the Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences where he pioneered the research in nuclear chemistry .
In 1972 , he was reached by Naeem Ahmad Khan and joined the chemistry division at the Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology .
He began working of equation of state on plutonium device as early as 1972 .
He developed and established the computerized radiation detection chemical analysis laboratories at PINSTECH in 1973 , which became an instrumental in detecting the tested radioactive emissions of Indias first nuclear bomb test at Rajasthan , in 1974 .
Notably , he balanced the crucial chemical equation required for the chemical reactions in the fission devices .
By 1977 , he famously discovered the technique in order for balancing the Q-value and energy balance in a fission device .
At PINSTECH , he was director of the nuclear chemistry division which was was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated , concentrated and isolated plutonium from uranium .
In 1983 , he successfully oversaw the PARR-III reactor went into criticality .
He engage his research in copper - nickle alloys after introducing the lattice dynamical method to evalulate the Cu29 / Ni28 alloys .
Key and fundamental research on understanding the neutron flux were carried out by Qureshi , in which , he managed to secure the patents from the IAEA .
After the conclusion of the clandestine atomic bomb projects , he was appointed chief technical officer at the PAEC in 1991 ; though he was more eager to return to academia .
Throughout his time at the PAEC , he had earned several scientific honours , including the Gold Medal and fellowship of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences in 1994 .
He was the recipient of the prestigious Sitara-i-Imtiaz by the Government of Pakistan in 1992 .
In 1997 , he was awarded the notable Khwarizmi Award on advancing and understanding the Nuclear analytical techniques development and application in Pakistan .
In 1996 , he retired from PAEC as senior scientist and was made scientist emeritus , which allowed him to continue research at PINSTECH before moving to Karachi .
He took up the professorship of chemistry at the Karachi University and headed the nuclear chemistry section at the H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry .
During this time , he authored several articles and published books on nuclear chemistry .
He retained his position till 2001 when he joined the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority .
At PNRA , he served as the chief scientific officer and adviser to the government on nuclear policy issues .
His contribution and policy efforts led to the physical security of the commercial nuclear power infrastructure in the country and helped launched the nuclear awareness campaign following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 .
He served until 2009 when he decided to accept the professorship of chemistry at the Institute of and Applied Sciences .
In 2012 , he died with a sudden problem of breathing , and buried in Karachi , Sindh .
As a scientist , he was remembered and noted as a very duty conscientious scientist throughout .
He was a versatile scholar who played classical Sitar on multiple public occasions
In Indian classical music , Sampurna ragas have all seven swaras in their scale .
In general , the swaras in the Arohana and Avarohana strictly follow the ascending and descending scale as well .
That is , they do not have vakra swara phrases .
In Carnatic music , the Melakarta ragas are all sampurna ragas , but the converse is not true , i.e. , all sampurna ragas are not Melakarta ragas .
An example is Bhairavi raga in Carnatic music .
Some examples of Melakarta ragas are Mayamalavagowla , Todi , Sankarabharanam and Kharaharapriya
The bansuri is a transverse flute of India made from a single hollow shaft of bamboo with six or seven finger holes .
An ancient musical instrument associated with cowherds and the pastoral tradition , it is intimately linked to the love story of Krishna and Radha and is also depicted in Buddhist paintings from around 100 CE .
The Bansuri is revered as Lord Krishnas divine instrument and is often associated with Krishnas Rasa lila ; mythological accounts tell of the tunes of Krishnas flute having a spellbinding and enthralling effect not only on the women of the Braj , but even on the animals of the region .
The North Indian bansuri , typically about 14 inches in length , was traditionally used as a soprano instrument primarily for accompaniment in lighter compositions including film music .
The bass variety , pioneered by Pannalal Ghosh has now been indispensable in Hindustani Classical music for well over half a century .
Bansuris range in size from less than 12 to nearly 40 .
The word bansuri originates in the Sanskrit bans + sur -LSB- melody .
There are two varieties of bansuri : transverse , and fipple .
The fipple flute is usually played in folk music and is held at the lips like a whistle .
Because it enables superior control , variations and embellishments , the transverse variety is preferred in Indian classical music .
Pannalal Ghosh elevated the Bansuri from a folk instrument to the stage of serious classical music .
He experimented with the length , bore and number of holes , and found that longer length and larger bore allowed for better coverage of the lower octaves .
He eventually pioneered longer bansuris with larger bores and a seventh hole placed a quarter turn inwards from the line of the other six finger holes .
Pandit Raghunath Prasanna was an Indian classical shehnai and flute player .
He was known for introducing the techniques of vocal and shehnai in flute playing , a new style of playing the Indian bansuri , different from the style of Pandit Pannalal Ghosh .
His flute playing has richly contributed by way of introducing novel techniques in blowing the flute , the manner of handling and fingering , methodical with emphasis on Gayaki Ang , the way of infusing shehnai techniques in flute playing particularly in playing the Jhala - the fast pace culmination of a Raga .
These novelties have gone a big way in strengthening the status of flute - from a folk instrument to the concert level .
He is mainly responsible for introducing various techniques of presenting light classical modes like thumri , chaiti , kajri and dhun in Bansuri playing , and play them with equal aplomb and telling effects .
Bansuri construction is a complex art .
The bamboo suitable for making a bansuri needs to possess several qualities .
It must be thin walled and straight with a uniform circular cross section and long internodes .
Being a natural material , it is difficult to find bamboo shafts with all these characteristics , which in turn makes good bansuris rare and expensive .
Suitable species of bamboo with these traits are endemic to the forests of Assam and Kerala .
After harvesting a suitable specimen , the bamboo is seasoned to allow naturally present resins to strengthen it .
Once ready , a cork stopper is inserted to block one end , next to which the blowing hole is burnt in .
The holes must be burnt in with red hot skewers since drilling causes the fibrous bamboo to split along the length , rendering it useless .
The approximate positions of the finger holes are calculated by measuring the bamboo shafts inner and outer diameters and applying certain formulae .
Flute makers have only one chance to burn the holes , and a single mistake ruins the flute , so they usually begin by burning in a small hole , after which they play the note and using a chromatic tuner and a drone called tanpura , gradually make adjustments by sanding the holes in small increments .
Once all the holes are perfected , the bansuri is steeped in a solution of antiseptic oils , after which it is cleaned , dried and its ends are bound with silk or nylon threads for both decoration as well as protection against thermal expansion .
Indian music is played in 3 octaves -- mandra , madhya , and taar -- with ornamentations such as meends and gamaks .
Bansuris range in length from less than 12 inches up to about 40 inches .
20-inch bansuris are common .
Another common and similar Indian flute played in South India is the venu , which is shorter in length and has 8 finger holes .
The index , middle , and ring fingers of both hands are usually used to finger the six hole bansuri .
For the seven hole bansuri , the little finger of the lower hand is usually employed .
As with other air-reed wind instruments , the sound of a bansuri is generated from resonance of the air column inside it .
The length of this column is varied by closing or leaving open , a varying number of holes .
Half-holing is employed to play flat or minor notes .
The sa note is obtained by covering the first three holes from the blowing-hole .
Octaves are varied by manipulating ones embouchure and controlling the blowing strength .
Various grip styles are used by flutists to suit different lengths of Bansuris , the two prominent styles being the Pannalal Ghosh grip , which uses the fingertips to close the holes , and the Hariprasad Chaurasia grip , which uses the pads of the fingers to close the holes .
While playing , the sitting posture is also important in that one should be careful not to strain ones back over long hours of practice .
The size of a Bansuri affects its pitch .
Longer bansuris with a larger bore have a lower pitch and the slimmer and shorter ones sound higher .
In order to play the diatonic scale on a bansuri , one needs to find where the notes lie .
For example , in a bansuri where Sa or the tonic is always played by closing the first three holes , is equivalent to C , one can play sheet music by creating a finger notation that corresponds to different notes .
A flutist is able to perform complex facets of Raga music such as microtonal inflections , ornamentation , and glissando by varying the breath , performing fast and dextrous fingering , and closing/opening the holes with slow , sweeping gestures .
These techniques are demonstrated by the famous Indian flautist Pt .
Hariprasad Chaurasia .
Since the bansuri is a natural woodwind instrument , it is prone to cracks and thermal stresses while playing .
Well known bansuri players include Pannalal Ghosh , Raghunath Prasanna , Raghunath Seth , Bhola Nath Prasanna , Hariprasad Chaurasia , Vijay Raghav Rao , Rajendra Prasanna , Ronu Majumdar
Jhoomra is a tala of Hindustani music .
Jhoomra tala has 14 beats .
Tilwada is often used in Kheyal
Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India was an Indian classical music revue led by sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar intended for Western concert audiences and performed in 1974 .
Its presentation was the first project undertaken by the Material World Charitable Foundation , set up the previous year by ex - Beatle George Harrison to sponsor diverse forms of artistic expression and to encourage the exploration of alternative life views and philosophies .
Long a champion of Indian music , Harrison also produced an eponymous studio album by the Music Festival ensemble , which was released in 1976 on his Dark Horse label .
Both the CD format of the Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India album and a DVD containing the orchestras performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London were issued for the first time on the 2010 Ravi Shankar-George Harrison box set Collaborations .
Shankars Music Festival orchestra featured many of the late twentieth centurys finest exponents of Indian classical music , including Hariprasad Chaurasia , Shivkumar Sharma , Alla Rakha , T.V. Gopalkrishnan , L. Subramaniam , Sultan Khan and sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar .
During the late 1960s Shankar had presented a Festival of India featuring the likes of Shivkumar Sharma , Jitendra Abhisheki , Palghat Raghu and several others .
The plan for the more ambitious Music Festival from India began taking shape when Harrison visited Shankar in the latters home town of Benares in January 1974 .
According to Harrison , though , it was something that he himself had been wanting to stage since about 67 , and particularly after hearing Shankars Nava Rasa Ranga while in Bombay for the Wonderwall sessions .
Unlike the cross-cultural Shankar Family & Friends album recorded the year before , the focus behind this new collaboration was to celebrate the traditional aspects of Indian classical music , both in concerts performed by the sixteen-piece Music Festival orchestra and in the studio .
Shankar would act as composer and conductor , rather than musician , and only play sitar on his famed ragas during the live performances .
Shankar soon gathered an impressive array of contributors for the project , whom he would describe decades later as these wonderful musicians who are now superstars .
Many of the players he had a musical history with already .
Almost all of them are among the greats of Indian classical music - flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia , tabla legend Alla Rakha , the multi-talented T.V. Gopalkrishnan on mridangam and vocals , South Indian violin virtuoso L. Subramaniam , sarangi master Sultan Khan , santoor pioneer Shivkumar Sharma , and Gopal Krishan , credited with the emergence of the vichitra veena in that musical genre .
The featured singer was once more the sublime Lakshmi Shankar , whose voice soared through three octaves with ease .
The two met again that summer in England , where Shankar composed new material specifically for the Music Festival and recorded it at Harrisons 16-track home studio at Friar Park in Oxfordshire .
Describing himself as an improviser by nature , every day for three weeks Shankar would leave his London hotel and head west on the M4 , during which he would write the music to be run through with the musicians that day in Friar Parks grand drawing room .
Harrison remarked of the process : It was amazing , because hed sit there and say to one person , This is where you play , and the next one , And you do this , and You do that , and theyre all going , What ?
OK , one , two , three ... And youd think , This is going to be a catastrophe - and it would be the most amazing thing .
The principal sound engineer on the sessions , and Harrisons regular engineer at FPSHOT during this period , was Shankars nephew Kumar , who joined the cast for publicity photos taken by Clive Arrowsmith in the house and grounds .
Midway through the proceedings , on 6 September , Harrison held a press conference in London and announced plans for the Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India tour of Europe , lasting through into October .
A co-headlining North American tour would follow , for which Harrison , as the main attraction , was growing increasingly unprepared , such was his dedication to this project , and after having already lavished months of his time on The Place I Love by Splinter , another Dark Horse act .
The program for the concert performances was divided into two distinct parts .
As Shankar explained at the time : The first part is in the form of a panorama , depicting major stages in the evolution of classical and traditional Indian music , starting with the Vedic hymns and the music of the medieval period , and ending with the present day , touching briefly on all the intermediate forms such as alap , dhrupad , dhamar , khyal , tappa , tarana and chaturanga ... The second part begins with the semi-classical forms such as the devotional bhajan and the romantic and erotic thumri , ghazal , dadra , etc. and ends with the very lively and earthy folk style .
True to the festivals title , the folk traditions of all the various regions of India were represented , in what was the first appearance by an Indian orchestra in Europe .
Similarly all-encompassing and educational were Naseem Khans liner notes for the Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India studio album , serving as an introductory guide to the wide variety of Indian musical instruments on display .
The album would be issued long after the European tour , however , due to the release of the much-delayed Shankar Family & Friends set in September 1974 .
Although little is available in the way of a tour itinerary , the Royal Albert Hall performance on 23 September appears to have been the Music Festivals opening night , after which the tour moved on to Paris , Brussels , Frankfurt , Munich and Copenhagen .
A beleaguered-looking Harrison took to the stage in London and admitted to feeling very nervous ... were behind schedule before introducing Shankar to the audience .
Following the completion of the European dates in October , the orchestra was slightly pared down for Shankar and Harrisons high-profile tour of the United States and Canada , beginning at Vancouver s Pacific Coliseum on 2 November .
All save for shehnai veteran Anant Lal and the ever-serene Kamala Chakravarty would face the at-times hostile audiences in North America .
Although the focus of Shankars set on this tour was to promote Shankar Family & Friends , selections from the Music Festival program such as Naderdani were adapted for American and Canadian audiences .
The album Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India was finally released in February 1976 , a year and a half after the recording sessions .
Like its predecessors , the cover features a group photo of all the participants , this time under a large cedar tree in the grounds of Friar Park .
Unsurprisingly , given that commercial rewards were never the motive for the Material World Charitable Foundations involvement , the record attracted little in the way of chart action .
Peter Lavezzoli , author of The Dawn of Indian Music in the West , recognises the ten-minute Raga Jait as being among the highlights of the set .
The Collaborations box set marked the first release for Stuart Cooper s film of Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India , shot at Londons Royal Albert Hall on Monday , 23 September 1974 .
Text at the start of the DVDs concert film section explains that much restoration was needed on both footage and audio , the latter being overseen by producer Paul Hicks and by Shankars daughter Anoushka Shankar .
With some of Coopers 35-year-old footage having been destroyed or mislaid , the remainder of the concerts sound is included in a separate , concert audio section .
In the film , the Albert Hall stage is set with two large risers ; the first in the shape of a square , the second , slightly more raised than the first one , is curved around behind it like a half-moon .
It is this set-up and the positioning of the musicians on the stage that provides the visual dynamics in the concert footage , despite the compromised film quality and the fact that any camera shots facing the players on stage right were obviously no longer available .
On the square riser , from left to right , sit singers Viji Shankar , Lakshmi Shankar and Kamala Chakravarty , with percussionist Harihar Rao and bansuri player Hariprasad Chaurasia behind them .
Spread out along the crescent-shaped platform behind this are the three bowed string players , L. Subramaniam , Satyadev Pawar and Sultan Khan ; the stern-looking Anant Lal on shehnai ; then the four drummers , T.V. Gopalkrishnan , Alla Rakha , Rijram Desad and Kamalesh Maitra , the last two partly surrounded by their tarangs of hand drums ; next is sitarist Kartick Kumar , Gopal Krishan , behind the raised vichitra veena , and finally Shivkumar Sharma , behind his large harpsichord-like santoor .
All sixteen pairs of eyes are on the Pandit Shankar , whos vigorously conducting the orchestra from just in front of the first riser , his back to the audience .
What is obvious in the film , yet not necessarily to casual listeners of the studio album , is the personality of each of the participants - Gopalkrishnan , at times fierce , then mischievous ; Rakha , the bemused patriarch , a tower of strength ; Desad and Khan , their faces a study in earnest concentration ; Lakshmi and Chaurasia , all passionate highs and lows ; the quiet demureness of Kamala , Rao and young Viji Shankar .
Through these characters , the film demonstrates the lively dialogue that is the musical performance : Shankar and Rakhas shared exchanges from sitar to tabla and back , drum salvoes traded with delight between Rakha and Gopalkrishnan , the apparent frustration on the conductors face turning to elation by the end of a piece .
Despite Harrisons concerns beforehand , the London audience sounds suitably impressed .
As American drummer Jim Keltner would later say of the not-always-appreciative crowds the orchestra faced in the United States : Those people saw something very special .
The DVDs bonus feature , directed by David Kew , shows Hicks and Anoushka Shankar at work on the mix for pieces released in this concert film section .
They are soon joined there at StudioWest , in San Diego , by Ravi Shankar himself and Harrisons widow , Olivia , allowing the 90-year-old Shankar to offer his input .
At one point Anoushka covers her fathers eyes playfully - in response , it seems , to his reaction at seeing himself on screen , performing some four decades before .
While it is stated that the 2010 Collaborations DVD contains the complete performance from the Royal Albert Hall concert , spread across the film and audio sections , its not clear how these two sections correlate - whether they make up two halves of the concert , or whether the musical pieces for which visuals have been salvaged were interspersed throughout the night .
This makes it impossible to ascertain the true running order of a typical Music Festival from India performance , but the concert program for the 1974 European tour was obviously from among the following track lists

He started learning his art at an early age of three in Jabalpur .
He then moved to Mumbai , and learned for over twelve years under Suresh Talwalkar .
Ghate accompanied Indian classical musicians , including Hariprasad Chaurasia , Vilayat Khan , Pandit Jasraj , Shivkumar Sharma , Amjad Ali Khan , Birju Maharaj , Shahid Parvez , and Vishwa Mohan Bhatt .

The shruti or sruti is a Sanskrit term used in several contexts throughout the history of Indian music .
A shruti is considered the smallest interval of pitch that the human ear can detect .
To know the real meaning of shruti , it is important to know the various contexts in the history of Indian music where the term is used .
Bharata uses shruti to mean the interval between two notes such that the difference between them is perceptible .
He formulates jatis , which are classes of melodic structures .
These can be further grouped into two gramas -- shadja-grama and madhyama-grama .
The notes are separated by intervals , which are measured in terms of shrutis .
The shadja-grama is given by the following division : Sa of four shrutis , Ri of three shrutis , Ga of two shrutis , Ma of four shrutis , Pa of four shrutis , Da of three shrutis and Ni of two shrutis .
Bharata also describes an experiment to obtain the correct physical configuration of shruti in shadja grama , Sarana Chatushtai .
The madhyama-grama is the same , but the panchama has to be diminished by one shruti .
That is , the panchama of madhyama-grama is lower than that of shadja-grama by one shruti according to Bharata .
Shruti is only mentioned as a perceptual measure in the music of Bharatas time .
Shruti is better understood with the following explanation .
In both the gramas , Ri is three shrutis away from Sa - there are three perceptible intervals between Sa and Ri .
The third of these is called trishruti rishabha .
Likewise , the second interval is called dvishruti rishabha , and the first ekashruti rishabha .
Notes at nine and 13 shrutis from each other are mutually samvadi .
The notes that are at the distance of two and 20 shrutis are mutually vivadi .
The remaining ones , at the distance between 2 and 20 shrutis , are called anuvadi .
The shruti table below shows the mathematical ratios considered to correspond to the system described by Bharata and Dattila , along with the comparable notes in common Western 12-TET tuning and comparable notes in 53-TET tuning , and the names of the 22 shrutis provided by Sarngadeva .
The 53-TET approximation has an maximum error of 1.5 cents , while the perfect fifths approximation has an maximum error of 2 cents .
The table below shows the Harmonic scales into shruti : .
As it show , the harmonics in scales of shruti are multiples of prime numbers 2 , 3 , 5 and 19 .
Theres not multiples of 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 23 , etc. , just of 19 so thats too weird .
Really its not 19 , but 19.2 , because 19.2 / 32 = 3/5 , which means that when we use the harmonic 19.2 , it becomes the harmonic 3 , and all of the harmonics multiplies up by 5 .
By the time Venkatamakhin formulated the melakarta system , the grama system was no longer in use .
Unlike the grama system , the mela system uses the same starting swara .
it forms the scales by varying the intervals of the subsequent swaras , and does not specify a fixed interval for a swara in terms of shrutis .
For example , the intervals of kakali-nishada and shuddha-madhyama would vary depending on the dhaivata and the gandhara that precede them , respectively .
The interval of kakali-nishada would be of three different shruti values depending on whether shuddha , panca-sruti or shat-shruti-dhaivata preceded it .
Thus shruti as a measure of interval is not fully utilized in the mela system .
The mela system still prevails .
The term shruti in current practice of Carnatic music , has several meanings .
It is used by musicians in several contexts .
For instance , the Tamil term Oru kattai sruti would mean that the tonic is set to the pitch C or the first key .
The Telugu term Sruti chusukko is a way to correspond with the accompanying artists to tune their instruments .
The term has also undergone a gross misunderstanding .
In certain ragas , due to inflexions or gamakas on few of those 12 notes , listeners perceive a sharpened or flattened version of an existing note .
Some scholars have attempted to fit such perceived new tones into the non-contextual Bharatas 22 shrutis , which lead to confusion and controversy over 22 shrutis .
It was also wrongly attributed to Bharata , who proposed shruti in a completely different context .
There is scientific evidence that shows that these intermediate tones perceived in the contemporary rendition of a raga does not hint at the existence of 22 shrutis .
The number 22 is of no practical significance in the current performance of Carnatic and Hindustani music traditions , partly because different musicians use slightly different shrutis when performing the same raga .
The phenomenon of intermediate tones is pursued as an active area of research in Indian Musicology , which says the number of perceptible intermediate tones may be less or even much more than 22 .
N. Ramanathan , a musicologist points it out and says that the idea of 22 shrutis is applicable only to the music system of Bharatas time .
The sufficiently new Indian monograph about shruti say there had been various opinions about the number of shrutis , but in recent times it seems that the number of shrutis is broadly agreed upon as 22 .
Recognizing the existing some controversy over the numbers and the exact ratios of the shruti intervals , it also say that all shrutis are not equal and known as nyuna shruti , pramana shruti and purana shruti .
Each shruti may be approximated in 53EDO system
Babul Mora Naihar Chhooto Jaye is a popular Hindustani classical music song in Raag Bhairavi .
The song was written by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah , the 19th-century Nawab of Awadh as a lament when he was exiled from his beloved Lucknow by the British Raj after the failed Rebellion of 1857 , where he uses the metaphor of bidaai of a bride from her fathers home , and his own banishment from his beloved Lucknow , to far away Calcutta , while he spent the rest of his years .
It was also popularised by the legendary classical vocalist , Pandit Bhimsen Joshi .
The most remembered version of the song is by actor-singer Kundan Lal Saigal for the Hindi movie Street Singer directed by Phani Majumdar , live on camera , under the music direction of Rai Chand Boral , just as playback singing was becoming popular .
Jagjit and Chitra Singh also sang a version of the song in film Avishkaar , set to music by Kanu Roy .
Your courtyard is now like a mountain , and the threshold , a foreign country .
I leave your house , father , I am going to my beloveds country

The esraj is a string instrument found in two forms throughout the north , central , and east regions of India .
It is a young instrument by Indian terms , being only about 200 years old .
The dilruba is found in the north , where it is used in religious music and light classical songs in the urban areas .
Its name is translated as robber of the heart .
The esraj is found in the east and central areas , particularly Bengal and it is used in a somewhat wider variety of musical styles than is the dilruba .
Originally an Afghan Instrument it first appeared in the region during the Pashtun rule of Northern India .
The Dilruba originates from the Taus and some argue is the work of the 10th Sikh Guru , Guru Gobind Singh , whilst that of the Taus was the work of Guru Hargobind .
The Dilruba was then produced to replace the previously heavy instrument .
This attempt was intended to scale down the Taus into what is now known to be the Dilruba .
This made it more convenient for the Sikh army to carry the instrument on horseback .
The structure of both instruments is very similar , each having a medium sized sitar - like neck with 20 heavy metal frets .
This neck holds on a long wooden rack of 12-15 sympathetic strings .
While the dilruba has more sympathetic strings and a differently shaped body than the esraj , they both have four main strings which are bowed .
All strings are metal .
The soundboard is a stretched piece of goatskin similar to what is found on a sarangi .
Sometimes the instrument has a gourd affixed to the top for balance or for tone enhancement .
The instrument can be rested between the knees while the player kneels , or more commonly rested on the knee of the player while sitting , or also on the floor just in front of the player , with the neck leaning on the left shoulder .
It is played with a bow , with the other hand moving along the strings above the frets .
The player may slide the note up or down to achieve the portamento , or meend , characteristic of Indian music .
The esraj is mostly used as an accompanying instrument .
It is the accompanying instrument of choice for Rabindra Sangeet singing .
However , it has also been used as a solo instrument to interpret Hindustani Classical Music , mostly in the Vishnupur tradition .
Additionally , the esraj is a more modern invention from the Dilruba that was made and promoted by the Namdharis .
Both the dilruba and the esraj had been declining in popularity for many decades .
By the 1980s the instrument was nearly extinct .
However with the rising influence of the Gurmat Sangeet movement , these instruments are once again attracting considerable attention .
A. R. Rahman is known as one of the composers in India who has used the Dilruba , in works like Dil Se and Vande Mataram .
Possibly the most famous exponent of the esraj has been Pandit Ranadhir Ray , who died in 1988 .
Kalipada Ghoshal .
Ranadhir Ray was a student of Ashesh Bandopadhyay , and was on the faculty at the Music department of Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan .
Today , the best known exponent is Buddhadeb Das , also from Santiniketan .
One of his leading student is Dattatreya Ghosh , reading in Nava Nalanda High School of there .
The esraj was the favourite instrument of the spiritual Master Sri Chinmoy who used it as a meditation tool and outlet for emotion , not necessarily to create or reproduce traditional music from the region .
In South India , the most famous exponent in the film industry to play Dilruba was Dilruba Shanmugham .
A great dilruba player , he has been conferred with the Kalaimamani award by the Tamilnadu Government .
He has played innumerous scores on Dilruba for legends like MSV and Ilayaraja .
Ravi Shankar played the Dilruba in the 1930s , as a member of the dance group of his older brother Uday Shankar .
Indian physicist and mathematician S. N. Bose is also known to play it .
Famous Bollywood music director Roshan was also a noted Esraj player
Shivaranjani or Sivaranjani is a musical scale used in Indian classical music .
There are two scales , one each in Hindustani music and Carnatic music .
The Hindustani raga is a pentatonic scale , while the Carnatic scale is a sampoorna scale .
The Hindustani raga Shivaranjani belongs to the Kaafi thaat in terms of classification of the scale .
Its structure is as follows .
The komal gandhar in place of shuddh gandhar is the difference between this raga and the global musical scale of Bhoop .
This Hindustani scale is also the currently popular scale in Carnatic music .
This scale is a janya ragam , as it does not have all the seven swaras .
It is a symmetric ragam that does not contain madhyamam or nishadam .
It is an audava-audava ragam in Carnatic music classification .
Its structure using swaras in Carnatic music notation is as follows .
In this form , Shivaranjani is considered a janya ragam of Kharaharapriya , the 22nd Melakarta ragam , though it can be derived from 3 other melakarta ragams , Gourimanohari , Hemavati or Dharmavati , by dropping both madhyamam and nishadam .
Shivaranjani ragam brings out karuna rasa and lends itself for elaboration and exploration .
It has many compositions in classical music and in film songs .
The popular Hindi film song Jaane kahan gaye woh din is based on this scale .
Shivaranjani was a favourite of the legendary composers Shankar-Jaikishan , in addition to the aforementioned song from Mera Naam Joker they also used it for O basanti pavan paagal in Jis Desh Men Ganga Behti Hai and O mere sanam in Sangam Mere naina Saon Vhado .
Kannum Kannum from the movie Thiruda Thiruda is regarded as the most different song done in this raga .
In Carnatic music , two ragamalikas start with a refrain in Shivaranjani .
M S Subbulakshmi made Kurai onrum illai very popular which begins with this scale .
Kurai onrun illai literally means there is no defect or there is nothing left wanting , alluding to we are satisfied and thankful in prayer to Kannan .
Another composition Muiyakka muiyakka , by Purandaradasa , also begins with this scale .
Another famous composition in this raaga is Jagat janani rendered in Tamil language .
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this ragam .
Shivaranjanis notes when shifted using Graha bhedam , yields 2 other pentatonic ragams , namely , Sunadavinodini and Revati .
Graha bhedam is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same , while shifting the shadjam to the next note in the ragam .
See Graha bhedam on Shivaranjani for more details and an illustration .
The Carnatic scale Shivaranjani is a janya ragam associated with the 64th parent scale Vachaspati .
It has vakra prayoga and its scale is as follows
Sangit Makarand is an ancient work on classical music written by Narada .
This work is a rare collection of definitions , descriptions and comments on all the essentials music by other ancient reputed authors from Bharata Muni to Sharangdeva .
Its main feature is the treatiment of Ragas ; categorizing them as male , female and neuter .
The treatise circa 1100 CE is the earliest text where rules similar to the current Hindustani classical music can be found .
Narada actually names and classifies the system in its earlier form before the advent of changes as a result of Persian influences .
It also hints on the uniqueness of the raga-nomenclaturing .
On close study of it , one learns of three distinct stages on the nomenclaturing of the Indian ragas

Roshan Ara Begum was a Hindustani classical vocalist .
In Pakistan she is revered as Mallika-e-Mauseeqi .
As the daughter of Ustad Abdul Haqq Khan , Roshan Ara linked through her cousin Ustad Abdul Karim Khan to Kirana Gharana .
Born in Calcutta in or around 1917 , Roshan Ara Begum visited Lahore during her teens to participate in musical soirees held at the residences of affluent citizens of Chun Peer in Mohalla Peer Gillaanian at Mochi Gate .
During her occasional visits to the city she also broadcast songs from the then All India Radio station , and her name was announced as Bombaywali Roshan Ara Begum .
She had acquired this popular nomenclature because she shifted to Mumbai , then known as Bombay , in the late 1930s to live near Ustad Abdul Karim Khan , from whom she took lessons in Hindustani classical music for fifteen years .
Her performance in Chun Peers abode in early 1941 pleasantly surprised local heavyweights and connoisseurs with her expertise in rendering classical compositions .
In Mumbai , she lived in a sprawling bungalow with her husband Chaudhry Mohammed Hussain , a police officer .
Possessing a rich , mature and mellifluous voice that could easily lend itself to a wide range of intricate classical music pieces , Roshan Ara employed her natural talent in the promotion of the art , which requires a high degree of cultivation and training .
Her singing features a full-throated voice , short and delicate passages of sur , lyricism , romantic appeal and swift taans .
All these flourishes were combined in her unique style that reached its peak from 1945 to 1982 .
Her vigorous style of singing was interspersed with bold strokes and layakari .
Migrating to Pakistan in 1948 after the partition of India , Roshan Ara Begum settled in Lalamusa , a small town from which her husband hailed .
Although far away from Lahore , the cultural centre of Pakistan , she would travel back and forth to participate in music and radio programmes .
Visual and audio recording-devices have preserved the richness of Roshan Aras music -- which often overflowed with tonal modulations -- its sweetness and delicacy of gamaks and her slow progression of raags .
Roshan Ara Begum also sang some film songs , mostly under music composers like Anil Biswas , Feroze Nizami and Tassaduq Hussain .
She sang for well-known films such as Pahali Nazar , , Qismat , Roopmati Baazbahadur and Neela Parbat .
She died in Pakistan in 1982 at the approximate age of sixty-five

Khayal and Thumri are my favourites , but that does not mean that I should not experiment with other forms .
Why should I curtail my musical urges ?
asks the singer and adds , I want to allow the artist in me to come through .

Riyaz is an Urdu language term used for music practice , for honing of Hindustani classical music vocal as well as instrument skills .
Sadhakam or Sadhana in Carnatic music .
It is followed rigorously by the students as well as exponents of vocal as well as dancing forms .
The Riyaaz or Sadhakam , which often starts early in the morning at four , is taken seriously by the students for it requires intensity , discipline and commitment for years and forms an important component in the Guru - Shishya parampara .
In Carnatic music , the impression is that the assiduous sadhakam of the Trinity of Carnatic Music was the bedrock of the excellence of the old-world vidwans
Bhopali , also known as Bhoop , Bhoopali or Bhupali , is a Hindustani classical raga .
It is a pentatonic scale .
Most of the songs in this raga are based on Bhakti rasa .
The same raga in Carnatic music is known as Mohanam .
Writing about the musical theory of Indian classical music is fraught with complications .
There is no universally accepted set of rules or formal method of writing notations .
However , the Bhatkhande and Paluskar paddhatis are the two ways of writing down musical notations .
Indian music has always been more of an aural tradition , and written word has never been an essential part of imparting talim .
Note : Normally written swaras indicate the middle octave .
A swara immediately followed by 1 indicates the mandra saptak and indicates the taar saptak .
Behavior refers to practical aspects of the music .
It is complicated to talk about this for Hindustani music since many of the concepts are fluid , changing , or archaic .
The following information can not be accurate , but it can attempt to reflect how the music existed .

Swaralipi is any system used in sheet music in order to represent aurally perceived music through the use of written for Indian classical music .
The Indian scholar and musical theorist Pingala , in his Chanda Sutra , used marks indicating long and short syllables to indicate meters in Sanskrit poetry .
In the notation of Indian raga , a solfege-like system called sargam is used .
As in Western solfege , there are names for the seven basic pitches of a major scale .
The tonic of any scale is named Sa , and the dominant Pa. .
Sa is fixed in any scale , and Pa is fixed at a fifth above it .
These two notes are known as achala swar .
Each of the other five notes , Re , Ga , ma , Dha and Ni , can take a regular pitch , which is equivalent to its pitch in a standard major scale , or an altered pitch , either a half-step above or half-step below the shuddha pitch .
Re , Ga , Dha and Ni all have altered partners that are a half-step lower .
Ma has an altered partner that is a half-step higher .
Re , Ga , ma , Dha and Ni are called vikrut swar .
In the written system of Indian notation devised by Ravi Shankar , the pitches are represented by Western letters .
Capital letters are used for the achala swar , and for the higher variety of all the vikrut swar .
Lowercase letters are used for the lower variety of the vikrut swar

The swarmandal or Indian harp is an Indian zither that is today most commonly used as an accompanying instrument for vocal Hindustani Classical music .
The name combines swara and mandal , representing its ability to produce a large number of notes ; it is also known popularly as Sur-mandal .
Swarmandals measure from twenty-four to thirty inches in length and twelve to fifteen inches in width .
The singer may choose to employ any number of strings from 21 to 36 .
The strings are hooked in a nail lodged in the right edge of the swarmandal and on the left are wound around rectangular pegs which can be tightened with a special key .
Wooden pegs were used instead of metal ones in the medieval period .
A sharp half-inch ridge on both sides of the swarmandal stands a little apart from the nails on which the strings are tightened .
This ridge functions as a bridge on both sides .
The swarmandal is similar to the autoharp or zither in many respects .
It is also similar to an instrument from Iran , and has been used for many generations , dating back to the Mughal era .
Some of the vocalists who have used this instrument extensively are Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , Ustad Salamat Ali Khan , Pandit Jasraj and Kishori Amonkar .
It was used in The Beatles single Strawberry Fields Forever , Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds , and Within You Without You , from the Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band album .
It was also used in the song Across the Universe from the Let It Be album
David A. Immergluck is an American multi-instrumentalist who is best known as a guitarist in the alternative rock bands Counting Crows , Camper Van Beethoven and the Monks of Doom .
A versatile musician , Immergluck plays mandolin , pedal steel guitar , electric sitar , and keyboards on a professional level , sings and harmonizes with backing vocals , and performs some songs as a slide guitarist .
David Immerglucks surname is Austrian , and roughly translates from German as always lucky .
His nickname is Immy , often coupled with the slang phrase gim me .
Immergluck began playing music in the San Francisco Bay area .
Like other aspiring young musicians , he played with various childhood friends , but began a lifetime habit of joining or sitting in with more than one band at a time , learning from the exposure to other differing musical influences and interests .
He early began to experiment with different sounds and a growing interest in instruments beyond just the guitar .
Performing in an esoteric rock band called Polymorph , Immergluck recorded his first singles with a band named Mod-L Society ; Back To Baltimore , and Janie , in 1985 .
By 1986 , he had moved on to a band called The Ophelias , and the same year , had spread his interests to joining other indie rock bands .
The Monks of Doom were a side project formed by members of the popular progressive Bay area indie rock Camper Van Beethoven .
Formed in 1986 , the Monks of Doom somehow fused post-punk sensibilities with prog rock decadence and folk tradition and elegance .
Six months into their career , original guitarist Chris Molla was expelled from the group due to his lack of commitment and was replaced by Immergluck , who contributed guitar , pedal steel , vocals , and keyboards in the group .
One Allmusic critic compared their work to pop experimentalists Frank Zappa and Syd Barrett .
Bassist Victor Krummenacher noted , We were interested in doing slightly more outside music that had heavier and more progressive tendencies .
It was an outside expansion , a chance to go wherever our imagination took us .
Immergluck described the sonic chemistry between that of himself and Lisher , the bands two guitarists , as music that seemed to juxtapose the chaotic and the beautiful , the raw bluster and the ornate .
Immergluck also joined Camper Van Beethoven as a member for the final tours of their initial run , prior to their breakup in 1990 .
The Monks of Doom intensified their activity after this , ultimately producing five albums to positive acclaim before the members took a long reprieve in 1993 .
Both groups have since reformed - Camper Van Beethoven in 1999 , and the Monks of Doom in 2003 .
Around 1993 , Immergluck became involved with an early incarnation of the modern rock group Counting Crows , and has since appeared in some capacity on all of Counting Crows albums .
Because of other musical projects , he initially functioned only as a session player .
With his skills on a variety of guitars , including both slide guitar and pedal steel guitar , mandolin , keyboards and backing vocals , he easily fell into place with old friends from the San Francisco Bay scene .
Since 1999 , Immergluck has been a permanent member of the band , touring and recording .
Immergluck joined another band , Glider , during the time he was contributing to the Monks of Doom .
He has also performed as both a session musician and a sideman with a wide range of other artists , including John Hiatt , Chantal Kreviazuk , Elan Sara Defan , Cracker , The Walkabouts , Low Stars , Jason Karaban and Sordid Humor .
Immergluck , along with Davey Faragher , was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Contemporary Folk Album in 2001 for his work with John Hiatt s album Crossing Muddy Waters , a bluesy soulful album of only three performers , without drums , compared by some to the work of Tom Waits , with Immergluck contributing mandolin , 12-string guitar , and slide guitar on many songs .
In 2013 , Immergluck appeared on the opening track of Joseph Arthur s tenth studio album , The Ballad of Boogie Christ .
Extensive description of instruments on the official website in the infobox : .
Immergluck has listed a variety of musicians who were influences on his music .

She was introduced to playing sitar at the age of nine by her uncle .

The history of the sitar in jazz , that is the fusion of the sounds of Indian classical music with Western jazz , dates back from the late-1950s or early-1960s when musicians trained in Indian classical music such as Ravi Shankar started collaborating with jazz musicians such as Tony Scott and Bud Shank .
Later jazz recordings containing sitar music include albums by Miles Davis , Alice Coltrane , Yusef Lateef , Joe Harriott , and Ornette Coleman .
Although music based around the sitar would later spread from jazz to more popular music via The Beatles , the sitar became more widely known in the western world mainly through the work of Indian musicians such as Pandit Ravi Shankar , beginning in the late 1950s .
From there it was taken up by jazz musicians and would later became a youth phenomenon in the mid-1960s after Beatle George Harrison took lessons from Ananda Shankar , nephew of Pandit Ravi Shankar , and played sitar on several songs .
The first recorded collaboration between Indian and Jazz musicians occurred in 1961 with Ravi Shankar and a group led by the West Coast American saxophonist/flutist Bud Shank .
Their album entitled Improvisations only features one track , Improvisations on the theme music from Pather Panchali , in which Ravi Shankar and the Western musicians play together .
The track is remarkable for little else ; it is simply Western film music with the sitar playing the melody .
However , it is interesting to note that this session , and that of film composer Shankar Jaikishan , were connected the film industry , for Indian film music surely contributes the most considerable corpus of music that combines Indian and Western musics .
However , both Ravi Shankar and Ananda Shankar are important figures with regard to Jazz because it was primarily through their music that John Coltrane and others became aware of Indian music .
Tony Scott recorded a track entitled Portrait of Ravi on his Dedications album , as early as 1957 .
Coltrane met Shankar in 1965 after a long period of mutual admiration and letter writing .
Coltranes name is inextricably linked to the emergence of modal Jazz in 1958 on Miles Davis album Milestones and it is believed that modal Jazz was inspired by Indian music .
Indian influence is an important issue in the later music of Coltrane such as the album Kulu Se Mama and also of musicians such as Yusef Lateef and Ornette Coleman .
In America , the profile of the sitar in Jazz was maintained by Collin Walcott .
After graduating from Indiana University in 1967 , where his major study was percussion , he travelled to Los Angeles to study sitar with Ravi Shankar and tabla with Alla Rakha , then the most famous tabla player in the West .
The most significant corpus of his output was with the groups Oregon , Codona and his own quartet , despite a prolific career as a sideman for players such as Miles Davis and Egberto Gismonti .
Walcott was heavily influenced by John Coltrane s Quartet .
Walcott , like Mayer , is musically bi-lingual which helps to explain why the Indian and Western aspects of his musics fit together far more comfortably than previous experiments .
Whilst Mayer acted as a bridge between musicians of two cultures , Walcott , like Coltrane , absorbed the Indian music and assimilated it within his own music .
His quartet consisted of other American musicians so that the feeling of empathy between the musicians , which is a pre-requisite of good group improvisation , is maintained .
Walcott created a sitar technique which is not found in Indian music .
This involves stopping more than one string to create harmonies , usually thirds .
The more recent excursion of the sitar into Jazz is that of the sitar player Nishat Khan who is highly regarded as an Indian Classical player .
His first experience of playing with a jazz musician was a trio with the guitarist John McLaughlin who has been collaborating with Indian musicians since the mid-seventies with groups such as Shakti .
In the Nineties , Nishat Khan was working on his own Jazz project .
He rehearsed with American alto saxophonist Steve Coleman and recorded with a band which consisted of Django Bates , Mark Mondesir , Martin France , and two drummers from Africa .
The group did not perform in public , and the recording was not released .
In 2006 , Andrew Cheshire released Silent Trees Falling , an album composed solely of .
electric sitar in a mostly trio setting .
Widely regarded as an unheralded master of jazz .
guitar , Cheshire combined raw jazz improvisation with an eastern flavored vocabulary resulting .
in a record that captures the spontaneity of jazz coupled with the sonority of the far east .
Comparative view of jazz and Indian classical music .
Indian music is the greatest tradition of improvisation in the East .
Therefore it is unsurprising that Jazz musicians , which have become the greatest exponents of improvisation in the West , have developed a certain fascination for Indian musicians and vice versa .
Coltrane was fascinated by Indian music .
Keith Jarrett returned to improvised music , after a phase of playing entirely Western Classical music , on hearing a concert of Indian Classical music which he claims was a reminder that what I was doing was not music .
This statement reveals that to Jarrett , who is primarily a Jazz musician , Indian music contains something intrinsic to his conception of music that does not exist in Western Classical music .
Both Jazz and Indian music are commonly described as improvised music but in fact , composition is integral to both arts .
Compositions are used mainly as a springboard for improvisation and would probably account for about a tenth of a performance in both traditions .
One of the functions of the composition is to define the structure upon which the improvisation is based .
In Indian music , the gat is always played at the beginning of the final portion of an exposition of a rag by the soloist and from this , the tabla player is expected to join in .
It is not uncommon for the tabla to have not been told what the tal or what tempo is to be used and would be expected to derive this information from the gat which he may not have heard before .
If the soloist wishes to change to a new tal or tempo it is signalled by playing a different gat .
The presentation of the two main instruments in jugalbandi has become common both in India and outside .
What happens in Jugalbandi is not unlike the organisation of collective improvisation in jazz , in the sense that the musicians come together in the precomposed song or whatever the basis of the piece , and otherwise take it in turns to improvise in a spirit both of cooperation and friendly cooperation .
In Jazz , the structure of the improvisation is most usually defined by the head which normally comprises a melody and a harmonic structure , but could contain more or less structural information such as changes of feel e.g. from swing to salsa , or changes of tempo or meter .
The standard form of a jazz performance would start with the ` head which might be 32 bars long .
Then , the musicians would take it in turn to improvise over this cyclic structure .
The performance ends with a recapitulation of the head .
Improvisations in both musics take place within cyclic frameworks , with the notable exception of free jazz which consciously eschews predetermined structures .
The ability to learn to use these frameworks to assist and inspire improvisation is really the essence of both art forms .
Being able to maintain ones place in the tal is precisely analogous to keeping the form in Jazz playing .
In fact , there are distinct similarities between the Sam of the tal and top of the form , the first beat of repeating structure , in Jazz .
The special feature of the Sam is that phrases either start or end on it , reinforcing the notion that the tal is a circular structure .
Whilst there is no such formalisation in Jazz of the ` top of the form , there is no doubt that musicians often use the ` top of the form as the point of maximum release of tension .
This is a chronological catalogue of recordings which have featured the sitar within a jazz context .

Haveli Sangeet is a semi classical form of Hindustani classical music sung in Havelis .
The essential component is dhrupad .
It originated in Uttar Pradesh in North India .
It is the daily worship of Lord Krishna .
Haveli was a place where Hindu deity were installed , due to restrictions on Hindu temples during the Muslim rulers , it was called Haveli Sangeet .
Basically , Haveli Sangeet is another name for Hindu temple music practiced by the followers of Vaishnavism of Nathdwara in Rajasthan , Gujrat , India , and considered a part of a rich historical tradition .
Having its origin in Rajasthan and Gujarat , the Haveli music is believed to have an edge over dhrupad for the common belief that the music has none other than Lord Krishna himself for an audience .
Essentially , a tribute to Krishna , its form includes , devotional renditions like , kirtans , bhajans and bhava nritya , all related to religious cult worship .
Although a mix of classical and folk music , the style is inherently borrowed from the dhrupad and Dhamar .
Haveli sangeet is commonly played at the many temples of India like the Radha Vallabh of Vrindaban , Krishna of Nandgaon , Uttar Pradesh and Sri Nathji of Nathdwara , to name a few .
With the passage of time , the haveli sangeet in India lost its importance and is no longer in practice as the general audience tends to take it for granted that all haveli music simply fall under the devotional genre .
In Gujarat , one of the music schools of thought believes that the origin of the Indian classical music has its roots in the haveli sangeet of Vallabha Acharya a pioneer in this genre .
The history of Indian classical music has it that the Vaishnavites of Nathdwara , were the ones to uphold this cult founded by Vallabh Acharya

Al Gromer Khan is a German-born sitar player and composer whose music spans the multiple genres of ambient , New Age , world and electronica .
Ne Alois Gromer , Al Gromer Khan was born on April 8 , 1946 at Frauenzell in alpine foothills of Bavaria between Lake Constance and Munich .
He spent his early years in Frauenzell and deserted from German Military Service to England , Morocco and India .
His father worked in Frauenzell as Bus Motor Carrier .
Gromer Khan claims that he was drawn to the mysteries of sound from the first , be it the sound of the bells worn by the Bavarian cows grazing in the alpine meadows near his birthplace , Indian stringed instruments , the drums of North Africa or the singing telephone wires on the wind in the freezing Bavarian winters .
Gromer Khan claims to have rejected the academic or diplomatic careers his parents expected him to take up .
The 1960s found a twenty-something Al Gromer in London where he took part in a number of creative experiments which were to have a lasting influence on him .
According to Gromer Khan , the Prince Tiane na Champassak of Laos introduced him to tantric art and pop star Marc Bolan invited him to join in the all-night jam sessions he hosted .
He explored psycho-acoustic phenomena with film director Mike Figgis , and saxophonist Ronnie Scott of Ronnie Scotts Jazzclub , who introduced Al to Ben Webster , Max Roach and Miles Davis , while Cat Stevens , gave him a taste for English poetry .
There is no doubt that Gromer Khans creative encounters during the 1960s deeply informed his musical taste and style ; however , Gromer 's ultimate musical awakening came during a trip to India in 1968 , at a recital by sitarist Ustad Vilayat Khan .
Gromer Khan professes to have been so moved by the performance that he instantly decided to devote his life to the study of the sitar .
He remained in India , where he was to find a powerful teacher in Vilayat Khans brother , Ustad Imrat Khan .
Gromer Khan remained in India for the next three years , speed-learning his instrument at the feet of his guru .
He returned to Bavaria in 1971 , already an accomplished sitarist .
Gromer Khan spent the next 10 years studying with Imrat Khan in Europe and India .
In 1975 , his teacher performed the Ghanda Ceremony , thus initiating Al Gromer into the Khan-I-Gharana lineage of sitarists .
He was the first outsider to be accepted into this particular Gharana , which like most Hindustani musical traditions , passes knowledge down the generations from father to son .
After his initiation , Al Gromer added Khan to his name .
Concurrently , Khan engaged in a number of experimental projects , pioneering the proto - electronic music genre called Space music , together with Popol Vuh , Deuter and Amon Duul .
Since 1974 , Khan has released nearly 40 albums .
He currently resides in Munich , Germany
Pandit Pran Nath was a Hindustani classical singer and teacher of the Kirana Gharana .
Pran Nath was born into a wealthy family in Lahore in present-day Pakistan .
While avid devotees of music , the family did not approve of his desire to become a musician , so he left home at the age of 13 and took up residence with legendary singer Abdul Wahid Khan of the Kirana gharana , cousin of the more widely known Abdul Karim Khan .
Pran Nath served Khan for 7 years before he was accepted as a student , and stayed with Khan for nearly two decades .
Both guru and disciple were much attracted to mysticism : Abdul Wahid Khan , a Muslim , to Sufism , and Nath , a Hindu , to a Shaivite sect in Dehra Dun .
It is said that Nath lived in a cave near the Tapkeswhar temple to Shiva for five years , serving his guru intermittently .
He eventually married and reentered the world at the request of his guru , in order to ensure the preservation of the Kirana style .
In 1937 , he became a staff artist with All India Radio .
However , Nath stuck to a very austere singing style - heavy emphasis on alap , and very slow tempi - which suited his voice well , but was not very popular to the modern Indian taste .
Like his teacher Abdul Wahid Khan , Pran Naths singing emphasized precise intonation and the gradual exposition of tone and mood in the alap section of the music .
Nath supported himself as a music teacher , and worked at the University of Delhi from 1960 to 1970 .
He was also a visiting professor of music at Mills College .
In 1970 , Pran Nath travelled to New York to visit the American composer La Monte Young and visual artist Marian Zazeela , who heard his first issued recording , Earth Groove : The Voice of Cosmic India .
In 1972 , he established his Kirana Center for Indian Classical Music in New York City and stayed in the U.S. for the rest of his life .
He taught at several universities and attracted a strong following among the American minimalist composers .
Pran Naths students included La Monte Young , Marian Zazeela , Terry Riley , Michael Harrison , Sargam Shah , Alex Dea , Charlemagne Palestine , Henry Flynt , Jon Hassell , Douglas Leedy , Don Cherry , Lee Konitz , Jon Gibson , Yoshi Wada , Rhys Chatham , W. A. Mathieu , Sufi Pir Shabda Kahn , Catherine Christer Hennix , George Brooks , and Simone Forti .
Like his teacher , Abdul Wahid Khan , Pran Nath did not emphasize recording or the releasing of records , preferring live performance .
As such , little recorded documentation of the Kirana Gharana style is available .
While only three recordings of Pran Nath were released during his lifetime , a large number of recordings exist under the care of La Monte Young .
In Pran Naths will Young , as executor of his estate , was instructed to begin releasing recordings

Vadi , in both Hindustani classical music and Carnatic music , is the dominant swara of a given raga .
Vadi is the most sonant or most important note of a Raga .
It does not refer to the most played note but it rather refers to a note of special significance .
It is usually the swara which is repeated the greatest number of times , and often it is the swara on which the singer can pause for a significant time .
Vadi swara in a raga is like a king in a kingdom .
Specialty of any raga depends on vadi swara and because of this , the vadi swara is also called the Jeeva swara or the Ansha swara .
A good artist uses vadi swara in different ways like singing vadi swara again and again , starting a raga with vadi swara , to end a raga with vadi swara , singing vadi swara many times in important places with different swaras or sometime singing vadi swara for a longer time in one breath .
Vadi swara is also helpful to identify the time of singing or playing a raga .
If vadi swara of a raga is from purvanga part of saptak i.e. `` Sa Re Ga Ma '' , then it is called as purvanga vadi raga and usually time for singing or playing purvanga vadi ragas are from 12 pm to 12 am for example ragas like Bhimpalasi , Pilu , Purvi , Marwa , Yaman , Bhoopal , and Bageshree etc. have purvanga vadi swara and so the time for singing and playing these ragas is between 12 pm to 12 am .
In the same way if vadi swara of a raga is from utranga part of spatak i.e. `` Pa Dha Ni '' then it is called as utranga vadi raga and time for singing or playing utranga vadi ragas is from 12 am to 12 pm .
For example ragas like Bhairav , Bhairavi , Bilawal , Kalingada , Sohini , and Asavari etc. have utranga vadi swara and so the time for singing or playing these raagas is between 12 am to 12 pm .
Vadi swara , along with the Samvadi swara of a raga , usually brings out the uniqueness of the raga and its bhava and rasa

Writing about the musical theory of Indian classical music is fraught with complications .
First of all , there have been no set , formal methods of written notation .
Indian music is an aural tradition , and therefore writing is not an essential part of attaining talim .
The bare scale of this raga has little unique musical meaning , and is , therefore , required to be documented in a manner that incorporates its zigzag phrasing pattern .

since it is the raga of spring , it can be considered that the raga has shringara rasa .

Abhogi is a raga in Carnatic music and has been adapted to Hindustani music .
It is a pentatonic scale , an audava or owdava raga .
It is a derived scale , as it does not have all the seven swaras .
Abhogi has been borrowed from Carnatic music into Hindustani music and is also quite popular in the latter .
Abhogi is a symmetric pentatonic scale that does not contain panchamam and nishadam .
It is called an audava-audava raga , in Carnatic classification , as it has 5 notes in both ascending and descending scales .
Its structure is as follows : .
The notes used are shadjam , chathusruti rishabham , sadharana gandharam , shuddha madhyamam and chathusruthi dhaivatham .
Abhogi is considered a janya raga of Kharaharapriya , the 22nd Melakarta raga , though it can be derived from Gourimanohari too , by dropping both panchamam and nishadam .
Abhogi is a scale that is used for compositions in a medium to fast tempo .
This scale has been used by many composers and there are lots of compositions in classical music .
It has been used to score film music too .
Here are some popular compositions in Abhogi .
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this raga .
Abhogis notes when shifted using Graha bhedam , yields another pentatonic ragam Valaji .
Graha bhedam is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same , while shifting the shadjam to the next note in the ragam .
For more details and illustration of this concept refer Graha bhedam on Abhogi .
P.Moutal understands raag Kalavati as transposition of Abhogi .
There are also some Tamil movie songs based on the raga of abhogi .
Songs in abhogi raga gives extreme pleasure to ears .
Two Tamil songs are cited below for the reference .

Pa and Ni are omitted .
Also Re is often omitted in ascent .
Flat Ga is often approached from Ma in ascent and has a slight oscillation to show the typical Kanada .
In descent often the typical Kanada phrase gMRS is used .
Related ragas : Bageshree .
However , Bageshree also includes flat Ni and a limited use of Pa , which gives a different flavour .

Tintal is one of the most famous talas of Hindustani music .
It is also the most common tal in North India .
The structure of tintal is so symmetrical that it presents a very simple rhythmic structure against which a performance can be laid .
Tintal has sixteen beats in four equal divisions .
The period between every two beats is equal .
The first beat out of 16 beats is called sam and the 9th beat is called khali .
To exhibit the Teental , the audience claps on the first beat , claps on the 5th beat , then waves on the 9th beat and lastly again claps on the 13th beat -- hence the name tintal : It derives from which means three and which means clap , so literally Tintal equals to three claps .
Cyclical series of equally periodical beats consisted of recurring claps and waves : .
clap , 2 , 3 , 4 , clap , 2 , 3 , 4 , wave , 2 , 3 , 4 , clap , 2 , 3 , 4 .
clap , 2 , 3 , 4 , clap , 6 , 7 , 8 , wave , 10 , 11 , 12 , clap 14 , 15 , 16 .
Teen Taal can be used for both accompaniment and solo.There are various Kaidas and Parans for it .
Note the bols used for the first beat of each division : Dhaa , a bol involving both hands , is played at the beginning of the first , second and final divisions ; for the khali section , Naa - a right hand bol - is used to indicate that the division is open .
There are some pedagogical variations as to the actual syllables pronounced when reciting the bol , most of which occur in the final two vibhags

The Sangita-Ratnakara of Sharngadeva is one of the most important musicological texts from India , which both Hindustani music and Carnatic music regard as a definitive text .
The text is also known as Saptadhyayi as it is divided into seven chapters .
The first six chapters , Svaragatadhyaya , Ragavivekadhyaya , Prakirnakadhyaya , Prabandhadhyaya , Taladhyaya and Vadyadhyaya deal with the various aspects of music and musical instruments while the last chapter Nartanadhyaya deals with dance .
The significant commentaries on the text include the Sangitasudhakara of Simhabhupala and the Kalanidhi of Kallinatha .
This work was written by Sarngadeva in the end of thirteenth century .
The author was attached to the court of Yadava King Singhana , whose capital was Devagiri .
As the title indicates the work deals with the subject of Sangita .
Sangita is defined as a composite art consisting of Gita , Vadya and Nrtta .
Sangita is of two kinds .
Marga-sangita and Desi-sangita .
Marga-sangita is nothing but the Natya performed by Bharata and his disciples .
This performance of Bharata also consists of Gita , Vadya and Nrtta .
Desi-sangita represented a tradition different from Marga and it varied from region to region .
Sarngadevas aim in this work is to describe primarily the Desi-sangita .
The aspects of Marga-sangita are also described to some extent .
The work is divided into seven chapters covering the aspects Gita , Vadya and Nrtta .
The seven chapters are : .
The Svaragatadhyaya is further divided into eight prakarana-s or sections .
The author commences with an account of his genealogy i.e. , about his family and the Kingdom where they lived .
The author also declares that among the three constituents of Sangita , Gita is primary and the most important .
Hence the treatment of Gita is taken up by him first .
The author also gives a list of ancient writers on music and related arts from whose work he has drawn out the essence and presented in Sangitaratnakara .
Some of them are Bharata , Kasyapa , Matanga , Kohala , Visakhila , Dattila , Abhinavagupta , Somesvara .
After some verses extolling the greatness of Gita , the author gives a list of topics to be dealt with in each chapter .
This section describes the genesis of the human body from its conception to its growth .
The reason for this information to be included is that , Nada is produced in the human body , hence the body has to be described .
The physiological account of the human body is given next according to the Ayurveda system .
This is followed by the indication of chakra-s , energy centres , based on the yogic school .
By concentrating on some of these cakra-s one could attain great heights in music .
This prakarana describes how Nada arises in the human body and how the Nada manifesting in the three Sthana-s or places in the human body Hrd , Kantha and Murdha gives rise to Mandra , Madhya and Tara varieties .
In each Sthana because of the presence of twenty-two Nadi-s , twenty-two Sruti - s are produced .
Sruti-s are units of tonal interval with which the interval of a Svara is measured .
Hence the Svara-s are described next .
After describing the intervals of the Suddha-svara-s those of the Vikrta-svara-s are given .
Suddha-svara-s conform to the arrangements of the seven svara-s of the Sadja-murcchana of Sadjagrama .
The Vikrta-svara-s differ from this arrangement .
There are seven Suddha and twelve Vikrta-svara-s , as shown in the table .
The seven Svara-s are also associated with the songs uttered by the various birds and animals e.g. Sadja with the voice of peacock .
The four kinds of roles that svaras play in a melodic structure , namely , Vadi , Samvadi , Vivadi and Anuvadi are described next .
Finally the association of Svara-s with different Castes , Colours , Islands , Seers , Chanda , Aesthetic tastes are given .
This prakarana deals with Grama , Murcchana , Krama and Tana .
Three Gramas are described - Sadja-grama , Madhyama-grama and Gandhara-grama .
The names of the Seven Murcchana-s in each Grama are also given .
Among the tanas there are two kinds - Suddha and Kuta .
Suddha-tana is a Murcchana devoid of one or two svara-s .
Kuta-tana-s are those varieties of Murcchanas in which the svaras occur in a disorderly way e.g. , s g r m p d n. Those varieties in which svara-s are present in an order are called Krama-s .
Sadharana is of two kinds Svara-sadharana Jati-sadharana .
Sadharana means being common to two or more elements .
When an extra svara occurs within the region between two svara-s then it is called sadharana svara .
Such svara-s are seen to occur in the region between Gandhara and Madhyama and between Nisada and Sadja .
Jati-sadharana deals with two jatis belonging to the same grama and having the same amsa and that consequently share similar scale formation .
The sixth prakarana is on Varna and Alankara .
Varna-s denote the different kinds of movements that a melodic line can take .
There are four varnas -- Sthayi , Arohi , Avarohi and Sancari .
Alankara-s are ornamental patterns of svara-s that decorate a melodic line .
Alankara-s are classified under the four Varna-s .
are described .
In addition seven more Alankara are given .
The seventh prakarana is Jati-prakarana in which the laksana-s or characteristics of eighteen Jati-s are given .
These eighteen Jati-s are : .
Before the description of the individual jati-s are furnished , the first seven are classified into ` Suddha and ` Vikrta and the remaining eleven as ` Samsaragaja .
The characteristics or the laksana-s that are used for a describing a Jati are the same ten as mentioned in Brhaddesi .
ii -RRB- Amsa : the predominant svara that formed the tonic and also frequently occurred in the melody .
iii -RRB- Tara : the svara in the higher register up to which the melodic movement could .
iv -RRB- Mandra : the svara in the lower register up to which the melodic movement could descend .
v -RRB- Nyasa : the svara on which a song finally concludes .
vi -RRB- Apanyasa : the svara on which the section of the song can conclude .
vii -RRB- Alpatva : the svara , which should be sparingly used or rendered weak .
viii -RRB- Bahutva : svara , which is strong and frequently used .
ix -RRB- Sadava : the svara , which could be omitted to render the jati in six notes .
x -RRB- Auduva : those two svara-s , which could be dropped to render the jati in five svara-s .
After the description of the Jati-s the author gives the notation of a song based on one of the Amsa svara-s of the Jati .
A song for each of the eighteen Jati-s is given .
The last prakarana is called the Giti-prakarana .
Although it is named thus it takes up the treatment of certain musical forms called Kapala and Kambala first and then goes on to Giti-s .
The Kapala songs are based on some derivatives of Jati-s and they are made up of words describing the fierce form of Lord Siva .
In the second part of this prakarana , the Giti-s are described .
Giti is a kind of variation brought about through changes in the duration of certain element of a song .
There are two kinds of Giti .
Pada-giti : It relates to the text of the song and denotes the change in the duration of the syllables of the text in a song .
Tala-giti : This relates to the change in the duration the Kriya-s or actions of a tala .
The second chapter describes the Raga - s .
The Raga-s are divided into Marga and Desi .
Among the Margaraga-s there are six varieties -- Gramaraga , Uparaga , Raga , Bhasa , Vibhasa and Antarabhasa , The four kinds of desi ragas are Raganga , Bhasanga , Upanga and Kriyanga .
Gramaragas resemble the Jati-s closely and they are further classified on the basis of the different melodic styles characterising them .
These styles are called Giti and are of five kinds -- Suddha , Bhinna , Gaudi , Sadharani and Vesara .
In all , there are thirty-three Gramaraga-s .
Uparaga-s and Raga-s are closer to Gramaraga-s .
Bhasa-s , Vibhasa-s and Antarabhasa-s are derivatives of Gramaraga-s and Uparaga-s and represent different tunes of the parent Raga .
Ragangaraga-s are derivatives of Gramaraga-s and Bhasanga-s are derivatives of Bhasa-s .
Kriyanga-s are certain melodic themes employed in dramatic performances portraying different kinds of emotions .
In this chapter Sarngadeva deals primarily with the Desiraga-s .
In addition he describes the parent Bhasa and the source Gramaraga-s .
Under each Gramaraga he gives in notation a song called Aksiptika based on that Raga .
The third chapter deals with a variety of topics .
They are -- a -RRB- The characteristics Vaggeyakara-s .
Vaggeyakara-s are composers of both the melody and text of a song .
b -RRB- Guna-Dosa : The characteristics of different kinds of Voice ; Merits and Demerits of Men singer , Lady singer , Sabda and Sarira .
c -RRB- Gamaka : There are fifteen kinds of Gamaka-s , namely the kinds of shake or oscillations that svaras can be endowed with .
d -RRB- Sthaya : There are ninety-six kinds of Sthaya-s , which represent the feelings or effects associated with raga phrases .
Prabandha represents a collection of musical forms described in terms of two aspects , namely , Dhatu and Anga .
Dhatu denotes the different sections , which are , at a maximum , five : .
These cover the three aspects of Music - Melody , Tala and the text .
Suda prabandha-s are further divided into two groups .
This chapter could be divided into 2 sections , one dealing with Marga tala-s the other with Desi talas .
The different aspects of these tala-s like the time units - Laghu , Guru and Pluta - , the Kriya-s ; the different forms of a tala like Ekakala Dvikala and Catuskala are described along with the Margatala-s .
In this section is also included the description of musical forms called ` Gitaka-s .
Gitaka-s musical forms are set in a temporal framework defined in terms of the margatala structures .
After these the Desitala-s used in the prabandhas , which total around 120 , are described .
In the sixth chapter come the four classes of musical instruments .
ii -RRB- Susira - Literally those with holes , i.e. , the wind instruments .
iii -RRB- Avanaddha - Literally covered i.e. , drums constructed as vessels covered by stretched membranes .
iv -RRB- Ghana - Literally dense objects i.e. , solid pieces like Bell , Cymbals etc. .
For these Vadya-s not only the construction but also the technique of playing and the compositions played on them are described .
Some of the instruments under the four categories are : .
a -RRB- Tata - Ekatantri , Citra , Vipanci , Mattakokila , Alapini , Kinnari .
The seventh and the last chapter is in two parts .
The first one deals with Nartana .
The term Nartana is a common term representing the arts of Nrtta , Nrtya and Natya based on the movements of the limbs of the body .
However only the aspects of Nrtta is relevant to Sangita .
The various elements of Nrtta like Hasta , Karana , Angahara and Cari are described and also the characteristics of a good dancer and teacher .
The different kinds of performance of sangita involving the three aspects of Gita , Vadya and Nrtta are described .
Some of these are - Suddha-paddhati and Gaundali-vidhi .
In the second part of this chapter , the author describes the Nine Rasa-s , namely , Srngara , Vira , Hasya , Raudra , Adbhuta , Karuna , Bhayanaka , Bibhatsa and santa .
Rasa-s represent the different tastes that are evoked in the audience by the human feelings that transpire in the performance of Sangita .
The court of the Yadavas of Devagiri , in which the Sangita Ratnakara was written , had an impressive history of patronage of the arts , literature and science that provided Sharngadeva with a conducive environment for scholarship .
Bhaskaracharya , the outstanding mathematician and astronomer produced his Siddhanta-Siromani , an exposition on algebra , shortly before Yadava independence .
His son Lakshmidhara was an astrologer in Jaitugus court and his grandson , Changadeva , held the same position during Singhanas time .
In 1207 , Singhana established school for the study of the works of Bhaskaracharya .
The aforementioned Changadeva was head of the school .
Anantadeva , Changadevas cousin , was also a great astronomer in Singhanas court .
He produced a commentary on the Brhadjataka , an ancient text on astrology , and a discussion on the Brahmasphutasiddhanta of Brahmagupta , a 7th-century text on mathematics .
In the time after Singhanas rule , Hemadri , a high administrator in the Devagiri court , wrote an incredibly detailed treatise on religious practice called the Caturvarga-Cintamani .
Bopadeva , one of Hemadris contemporaries , wrote a number scholarly works while in the Devagiri court , including more than one book on Ayurveda and a commentary on the Bhagavata purana , a religious text .
Jnanadeva wrote his Jnanesvari , an important piece of early Marathi literature , under the rule of the later Yadava Kings .
Clearly , the Devagiri court was an accommodating environment for scholarly endeavors .
Sangitaratnakara is a very important text and this is evident from the fact that many commentaries were written on it .
The famous ones are Sangitasudhakara of Simbabhupala and Kalanidhi of Kallinatha .
Sangitaratnakara is to a great extent a compilation of the information found in earlier works like Natyasastra , Dattilam , Brhaddesi , Sarasvati-hrdayalankara-hara and is greatly influenced by the commentary of Abhinavagupta on Natyasastra .
On the other hand the work made a great impact on almost all the writers in the subsequent period .
Thus it forms a useful bridge between the ancient and the medieval periods .
Sarngadeva called himself Nih , sanka i.e. , ` doubtless .
He also names a stringed instrument as Nih,sanka-Vina and Desi-tala as Nih,sanka-tala .
This book is a great landmark in the history of Indian Music
Pandit Taranath Ram Rao Hattiangadi was a performer and teacher of Indian classical percussion , known for his knowledge of rare talas and old compositions .
He represented the Farukhabad , Delhi , and Ajrada gharanas of tabla , and the Nana Panse tradition of pakhavaj .
He studied formally for 47 years -- an exceptional amount of time , even in the Indian master-disciple system -- under many pandits and ustads , most notably Shamsuddin Khan .
He had numerous disciples and students of special training .
Taranaths most significant studenship was under Shamsuddin Khan , gurubhai of Ahmed Jan Thirakwa and main accompanist to Kirana Gharana vocalist Abdul Karim Khan .
He also learned from Subbarao Ankolekar , Vishnu Goakar , Laya Brahma Bhaskar Khaprumama of Goa , Fayaz Khan of Kanpur , Shankarao Alkutkar , Baburao Ghokle , and Kallu Khan , all noted percussionists .
Taranath moved from his native Mangalore to Bombay in 1932 , and for decades was a scion of that citys music scene -- first as a performer and concert organizer , and later , as his health declined , a musical mentor and authority .
On All India Radio he gave solo recitals and lecture-demonstrations on topics in North and South Indian classical music , most frequently on advanced , historical or unusual rhythmic structures and compositions .
He was involved in scholarly projects such as Nikhil Ghoshs Encyclopedia of Music and Dance in India , and was honored in courtly traditions by the Maharajas of Mysore , Kolhapur , Baroda and Savantwadi .
Taranath Rao was a close collaborator with influential figures such as Allaudin Khan , Ravi Shankar and the revolutionary flautist Pannalal Ghosh .
His erudition and alliance were sought by members of the Bombay tabla world including Amir Hussain Khan , Pandharinath Nageshkar , Nikhil Ghosh and Nizamuddin Khan , and he was a close confidant of Ahmed Jan Thirakwa .
Rao also provided specialty training to a number of already established artists , many of whom were preparing to accompany rhythm-virtuoso Ravi Shankar , among them Chatur Lal .
As a soloist , Rao was known for the architecture and content of his recitals .
These normally weaved together sequences of exclusive , archival material with his original compositions .
Such pieces were difficult to execute , drawing upon diverse influences in tabla and pakhavaj .
Later in his career , Taranath showcased his style and repertoire through his students , arranging interactive public concerts during which he would lead the performers on harmonium and prompt them with spontaneous instructions and recitation of compositions .
As teenagers , a number of these disciples earned accolades such as the All India Radio Competition Presidents Award , and many went on to become master and expert level concert performers .
As an accompanist , Rao performed with nearly all prominent vocal and instrumental raga legends of his time .
These include Allaudin Khan , Enayat Khan , Hafiz Ali Khan , Amir Khan , Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , Ravi Shankar , Vilayat Khan , Ali Akbar Khan , Abdul Karim Khan , Hirabai Barodekar , Suresh Babu Mane , Sawai Gandharva , Bhimsen Joshi , the senior Dagar Brothers , Salamat and Nazakat Ali Khan , Kumar Gandharva , Kishanrao Shankar Pandit , Mallikarjun Mansur , Pannalal Ghosh , Devendra Murdeshwar , Aftab-e-Mousiqi Fayyaz Khan , Khadim Hussein Khan , SCR Bhatt , Chidanand Nagarkar , Lakshmi Shankar , Omkarnath Thakur and Rais Khan .
Among this list are not only the most celebrated Indian classical musicians of the twentieth century , but also many of their gurus , and in some cases , their guru 's gurus .
Two of Raos most treasured performances were with Ravi Shankar in the Court of Maharaja of Mysore and with Ali Akbar Khan in the court of Maharaja of Jodhpur in the 1950s .
Taranath Rao was a venerated curator of Indian percussion , but he is also remembered for his modern outlook on classical music , innovative approach to drumming , and progressive , systematic teaching style .
Along with Jnan Prakash Ghosh of Calcutta , he helped pioneer many contemporary features of solo tabla drumming , such as duo performance .
The dual-solo format was largely popularized by Raos disciples Ravi and Shashi Bellare , leading tabla players of the 1950s and 60s , and later by contemporary master Alla Rakha with his son the prodigy Zakir Hussain .
In terms of sheer numbers , Rao was a prolific guru , introducing to some 2,000 students the legacy of traditional gharana masters .
In addition to private tuitions from his home in Bombay , Taranath taught , lectured and gave examinations at institutions including Ravi Shankars Kinarra School , Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan , Bhatkande University , Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda , and the Kala Academy in Goa .
For the last 12 years of his life , Taranath taught at CalArts in Los Angeles , where his younger brother Harihar Rao was heading the Ravi Shankar Music Circle .
His disciples around the world , include Ravi Bellare , Shashi Bellare , Sadanand Naimpalli , Omkar Gulvady , Mohan Balvally , Uday Raikar , Maruti Kurdekar , Vijay Kangutkar , Balakrishna Iyer , Jayawant Bantwal , Anand Badamikar , Jef Feldman , Peter Fagiola , Roland Drogemuller , Gregg Johnson , Bengt Berger , Rupesh Kotecha , Narayan Kadekodi , Vilas Jadhav , Kishore Kulkarni and Leonice Shinneman .

Pandit Ratnakar Pai was a Hindustani classical music vocalist of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana .
Pai received musical training from two erudite teachers , Mohanrao Palekar and Utd .
Gulubhai Jasdanwalla .
Pais was regarded as the foremost authority on the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana because he represented a union of the two sub-streams of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana , having learnt from descendants of Gharana founder Utd .
Alladiya Khan and from the foremost , non-blood-related disciples of the Ustad .
Pai was instrumental in clarifying the differences and enhancing the wholesomeness of the Gharanas ideology .
Although Pai did not take to a full-fledged performance career , Pai was regarded as an expert on Khayal by musicians and musical connoisseurs .
Pais primary focus was teaching , where his many successful students are evidence of his musical stature .
Endowed with a sweet voice and an uncanny sense of Laya , Pai 's singing is one of the purest expressions of the traditional Jaipur-Atrauli Gayaki .
The aesthetics of the gayaki are based on the solid foundation of compositions that delineate the nuances of a Raag accompanied by an syncopated approach to laya .
The balance of melody and rhythm is tightly woven and the appeal is distinct to the structural and intellectual aspects of creativity , with emphasis on precision , clean and bold strokes and balance , rather than on frills , decoration and technical showmanship .
Pai died on the evening of August 9 , 2009 .
He was not keeping good health and underwent an operation for gangrene several months prior .
Pai has taught many successful musicians , including Jitendra Abhisheki , Bhalchandra G. Tilak , Dr. Milind Malshe , Mrs. Shalmalee Joshi , and Smt .

Tarana is a type of composition in Hindustani classical vocal music in which certain words and syllables based on Persian and Arabic phonemes are rendered at a medium or fast pace .
It was invented by Amir Khusro , and is similar to the Qalbana form of Sufi poetry .
In modern times the tarana is most commonly associated with the singer Amir Khan , who helped popularize it and researched its origins and the syllables used .
The structure consists of a main melody , usually short , repeated many times , with variation and elaboration at the performers discretion .
There is a second , contrasting melody , usually with higher notes , which is introduced once before returning to the main melody .
The tarana may include a Persian couplet , and may use syllables from sitar or tabla such as dar-dar or dir-dir ; singers might recite full compositions within the body of the tarana .
In the words of Thakur Jaidev Singh , an influential commentator on Indian music : .
The thillana from Carnatic music is based on the tarana , according to Balasaraswati , and is widely used in dance performances
The tabla is a membranophone percussion instrument , which are often used in Hindustani classical music , but was actually invented by Muslim Sufi , Amir Khusro .
It is still used in the music behind folk and sufi poetry .
It later became a part of Hindustani music industry .
The instrument consists of a pair of hand drums of contrasting sizes and timbres .
The term tabla is derived from an Arabic word , tabl , which simply means drum .
The tabla is used in some other Asian musical traditions outside of India , such as in the Indonesian dangdut genre .
Playing technique involves extensive use of the fingers and palms in various configurations to create a wide variety of different sounds , reflected in the mnemonic syllables .
The heel of the hand is used to apply pressure or in a sliding motion on the larger drum so that the pitch is changed during the sounds decay .
The tabla is thought to have been invented by the Sufi poet and musician Amir Khusro in the 13th century , originating from the need to have a drum that could be played from the top in the sitting position to enable the more complex rhythm structures that were required for the new Indian Sufi vocal style of chanting and Zikr .
Its invention would also have complemented the complex early Sitar melodies that Amir Khusrow was composing .
Amir Khusro supposedly created the tabla by splitting the mridangam or the pakhawaj in two .
However none of his writings on music mention the drum , and there are Hindu temple carvings of double hand drums resembling tabla that date back to 500 BC .
The Tabla uses a complex finger tip and hand percussive technique played from the top unlike the Pakhawaj and mridangam which mainly use the full palm and are sideways in motion and are more limited in terms of sound complexity .
Rebecca Stewart has suggested that the tabla was most likely a product of experiments with existing drums such as pakhawaj , mridang , dholak and naqqara .
The origins of tabla repertoire and technique may be found in all three and in physical structure there are also similar elements : the smaller pakhawaj head for the dayan , the naqqara kettledrum for the bayan , and the flexible use of the bass of the dholak .
The earliest known iconography of the tabla dates back to 1799 .
The smaller drum , played with the dominant hand , is sometimes called dayan , dahina , siddha or chattu , but is correctly called the tabla .
It is made from a conical piece of mostly teak and rosewood hollowed out to approximately half of its total depth .
The drum is tuned to a specific note , usually either the tonic , dominant or subdominant of the soloists key and thus complements the melody .
The tuning range is limited although different dayan-s are produced in different sizes , each with a different range .
Cylindrical wood blocks , known as ghatta , are inserted between the strap and the shell allowing tension to be adjusted by their vertical positioning .
Fine tuning is achieved while striking vertically on the braided portion of the head using a small hammer .
The larger drum , played with the other hand , is called bayan or sometimes dagga , duggi or dhama .
The bayan has a much deeper bass tone , much like its distant cousin , the kettle drum .
The bayan may be made of any of a number of materials .
Brass is the most common , copper is more expensive , but generally held to be the best , while aluminum and steel are often found in inexpensive models .
Sometimes wood is used , especially in old bayans from the Punjab .
Clay is also used , although not favored for durability ; these are generally found in the North-East region of Bengal .
Both drum shells are covered with a head constructed from goat or cow skin .
An outer ring of skin is overlaid on the main skin and serves to suppress some of the natural overtones .
These two skins are bound together with a complex woven braid that gives the assembly enough strength to be tensioned on the shell .
The head is affixed to the drum shell with a single cow or camel hide strap laced between the braid of the head assembly and another ring placed on the bottom of the drum .
The head of each drum has a central area of tuning paste called the syahi .
This is constructed using multiple layers of a paste made from starch mixed with a black powder of various origins .
The precise construction and shaping of this area is responsible for modification of the drums natural overtones , resulting in the clarity of pitch and variety of tonal possibilities unique to this instrument which has a bell-like sound .
The skill required for the proper construction of this area is highly refined and is the main differentiating factor in the quality of a particular instrument .
For stability while playing , each drum is positioned on a toroidal bundle called chutta or guddi , consisting of plant fiber or another malleable material wrapped in cloth .
Indian music is traditionally practice-oriented and until the 20th century did not employ notations as the primary media of instruction , understanding , or transmission .
The rules of Indian music and compositions themselves are taught from a guru to a shishya , in person .
However , the notation is regarded as a matter of taste and is not standardized .
Thus there is no universal system of notation for the rest of the world to study Indian music .
Maula Bakhsh was an Indian musician , singer and poet .
His grandfather was Hazrat Inayat Khan , founder of the Universal Sufism .
Developed the first system of notation for Indian music .
He also founded the first Academy of Music in India in 1886 , based in Baroda that encompassed both Eastern and Western musical cultural traditions .
Hindustani classical music has two standard notation systems , one designed by V. N. Bhatkhande and the other by V. D. Paluskar .
These notation systems are used for Indian instruments including the tabla .
Some basic strokes with dayan on right side and bayan on left side are : .
The term gharana is used to specify a lineage of teaching and repertoire in Indian classical music .
Most performers and scholars recognize two styles of tabla gharana : Dilli Baj and Purbi Baj .
Dilli baj comes from the style that developed in Delhi , and Purbi baj developed in the area east of Delhi .
Delhi Baj is also known as Chati baj .
Musicians then recognize seven gharanas - schools or traditions - of tabla .
These traditions appeared or evolved in presumably the following order : .
Some traditions have sub-lineages and sub-styles that may meet the criteria to warrant a separate gharana name , but such socio-musical identities have not taken hold in the public discourse of Hindustani art music , such as the Qasur lineage of tabla players of the Punjab region .
Each gharana is traditionally set apart from the others by unique aspects of the compositional and playing styles of its exponents .
For instance , some gharanas have different tabla positioning and bol techniques .
In the days of court patronage the preservation of these distinctions was important in order to maintain the prestige of the sponsoring court .
Gharana secrets were closely guarded and often only passed along family lines .
Being born into or marrying into a lineage holding family was often the only way to gain access to this knowledge .
Today many of these gharana distinctions have been blurred as information has been more freely shared and newer generations of players have learned and combined aspects from multiple gharanas to form their own styles .
There is much debate as to whether the concept of gharana even still applies to modern players .
Some think the era of gharana has effectively come to an end as the unique aspects of each gharana have been mostly lost through the mixing of styles and the socio-economic difficulties of maintaining lineage purity through rigorous training .
Next to the contemporary common style of tabla , there exist older styles in which the bayan is often made out of wood .
Instead of having a thin dry syahi , this style of tabla uses a wet wheat dough on the bass drums skin , applied shortly before playing .
These types of Jori tabla are used by qawwali ensembles , as well as in the Sikh tabla gharanas , Punjabi dhrupad , gurbani kirtan , and Afghan traditional music .
A reminder that this style of tabla was used all over India not long ago is that many modern brass tuning hammers still have a dough removal spatula on the reverse end .
With the North Indian style of playing there are two primary facets in which the tabla is played , through tal and rag .
The tal form of playing is very rhythmic as it features various sets of beats , such as 10 , 12 , and 16 .
The tal playing of tabla can easily be combined with other Indian musical instruments , such as the harmonium , in order to create musical performances due to the rhythmic tune the tabla creates .
The rag on the other hand features a structured play of notes in which the tabla can play , and has been around for a longer period of time

Ranjit Makkuni is an international multimedia artist and designer , the director of the design think tank , the Sacred World Research Laboratory .
His multidimensional , multimedia museum works are intersections between traditional and modern art , design and technology , such that the results help both traditional and modern cultures .
They are intended to show that the wisdom of traditional communities can positively negate the homogenizing influences of modern technology ; and that the intelligence , creativity and sense of freedom afforded by modern design and technology can reciprocally help traditional artists .
His major works are several museum projects : Eternal Gandhi Multimedia Museum , .
Planet Health Museum , The Goddess and Temples of Music , and The Crossing : Living , Dying and Transformation in Banaras .
Ranjit obtained a B.Arch .
from IIT , Kharagpur , and a Masters in Design Theory and Methods from University of California Los Angeles .
He has been a scientific consultant to HP Labs Palo Alto , HP Labs Bangalore , and a member of the Explorer 's club of the Ivrea Institute of Design , Ivrea , Italy .
He is a member of the mentoring group of Nehru Memorial Museum , New Delhi , constituted by the Prime Minister of India .
In 1985 , Ranjit joined the System Concepts Lab of PARC , becoming part of the group which developed the Smalltalk-80 Object Oriented programming language and the worlds first graphic user interface .
From that base , Ranjit pioneered explorations in computer-aided design , gesture-based interfaces , and multimedia applications to develop the Active Learning Project at PARC .

These have been demonstrated as museum exhibitions in the US , India , Europe and Thailand , transforming people 's perceptions of traditional cultures , and presenting an Asian approach to interaction with computing technology .
In 1989 , The Electronic Sketchbook of Tibetan Thangka Painting was displayed in the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco .
This project represents one of the worlds first multimedia applications of any kind and a pioneering example of a computer based cultural learning tool .
During 1994-1997 , he worked with scholars at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts , New Delhi , to develop the Gita-Govinda Multimedia Experience , a pioneering demonstration of a physical-virtual multimedia document based on the poet Jayadeva 's 12th century love poem , the Gita Govinda .
This project brought the footprints of multimedia computing technology to India .
During 1998-2002 , Ranjit conceived and directed The Crossing Project : Living , Dying , and Transformation in Banaras which developed a panorama of digital information access devices and technologies personalized by the cultural traditions of Banaras .
The project brought together Western Information Access Knowledge systems and Indian notions of connection and interaction based on India 's city of Knowledge , Banaras .
The project was a pioneering demonstration of physical computing , and culturally personalized computing hardware and interactions .
During 2003-2005 , Ranjit visualized and directed the Eternal Gandhi Multimedia Museum , New Delhi , one of the world 's first digital multimedia museums .
Located at the site where Mahatma Gandhi attained martyrdom , the museum preserves the historical events of Gandhiji 's life in digital form but also presents a spectrum of information technology visions inspired by Gandhian thought .
The project revives the values by which India obtained freedom ; it also redefines those values in order to animate modern products and design .
Through a collection of over 50 originally designed works of technology and art , the project interpreted Gandhian thought in the design of new technology and illustrated how village aesthetics and creativity can shape modern design .
In 2010 , Ranjit built the Planet Health Museum , an interactive museum that allows people to access traditional Green philosophy and the concept and experience of health from the perspectives of Ayurveda and Yoga .
Starting from the concept of health and Indian perspectives of the body , the project illustrated new visions and tools for a healthy society and planet .
The project presents this vision across a spectrum of disciplines using many forms of visual and performing arts , ancient sciences and modern interaction design to communicate the vision .
Ranjit 's 2012 exhibition , The Goddess and Temples of Music project puts forth a vision of the beauty and spirituality of the feminine , and hopes to inspire in people respect for Woman , based on the world 's Goddess traditions .
Using the forms of musical instruments and music as a tool to unravel the language of the sacred feminine , the project transforms Modern Man 's perceptions , illustrating possibilities for a positive , compassionate , sustainable way of life .
The project presents both traditional and new instruments based on Indian Vina based instruments , Sitar , Burmese Harp , Thai Xylophone , Korean Kayagum , and Javanese & Balinese Gamelan .
New Instruments with embedded computation demonstrate tactile computing , i.e. , interaction with computers through gesture and kinaesthetic action .
In addition , through responsive computing , people by their position , gesture , and movements control musical events in the environment .
In 2013 , Ranjit launched Musical Landscapes and the Goddesses of Music at the National Museum , New Delhi .
This exhibition explores the science , art and spirituality of Music , and its reflections in the Goddess images across Asian cultures .

Krishna Das is a U.S. vocalist known for his performances of Hindu devotional music known as kirtan .
With eight albums released since 1996 , Das is perhaps the best known U.S. singer of kirtan-style music .
He is also sometimes referred to as the Rockstar of Yoga .
Krishna Das traveled to India in August 1970 where , as Ram Dass had done , he studied with a Hindu guru named Neem Karoli Baba .
Krishna Das has studied ancient Indian meditation practices , Bhakti Yoga - in Hinduism this is the yoga of devotion , and is now devoted to singing and teaching .
He has released several CDs , and he travels around the world giving performances and teaching , sometimes with Ram Dass .
In recent years he also has often led workshops in combination with leading meditation teacher Sharon Salzberg .
He has also offered workshops with yoga teacher Dharma Mittra .
In India , he visits Rishikesh for practicing Yoga and meditation .
Krishna Das is arguably the best known U.S. singer of Indian kirtan-style devotional music .
Other artists working within this genre include Bhagavan Das , Jai Uttal , Ragani , Sean Johnson and The Wild Lotus Band , Shyamdas , Lokah Music , Wah !
, Deva Premal , Girish , Shantala and David Newman .
Krishna Das has recorded numerous variations of Hanuman Chalisa , a 40 stanza Hindi devotional poem to Hanuman by Tulsidas .
In recent years , he has also performed and recorded the traditional gospel song , Jesus is on the Mainline .
He has commented that he read the Gospels while in India and , they sound a lot different at 10,000 feet .
He also remarked that there has been some criticism about an ex-Jewish boy chanting the name of Jesus .
He responds to this by saying that his guru , Neem Karoli Baba , once said Jesus is Love , and singing about Jesus is just singing about love .
Other heterodoxies are found on his album Door of Faith , which includes a setting of the Hanuman Chalisa that interpolates the Buddhist Gate of Sweet Nectar , and a setting of the Gospel tune God is Real , which blends in Hare Ram .
Krishna Dass harmonium bears an image of Hanuman , and he generally wears red T-shirts when he performs .
Krishna Dass musical style is distinctly Western , using chord progressions typical of Western popular music .
The kirtans he leads often build from a slow , meditative tempo to a high paced catharsis .
It is common for his audiences to stand up and dance during some of his Hare Krishna chants .
The ensembles with which Krishna Das performs change frequently .
He is usually accompanied by a tabla player , other percussions , strings , or electric bass guitar , or guitar .
Often , he is accompanied on kartals by Nina Rao .
Krishna Das has been associated with many other artists .
Two of his albums have featured Hans Christian as a guest multi-instrumentalist , and Sting appears on the album Pilgrim Heart .
He has also appeared on an album with Baird Hersey & Prana entitled Gathering In The Light .
Krishna Das has written about how his Guru put him onto the path of Kirtan , and a quotation follows : .
At what would turn out to be my last darshan of Maharaj-jis physical body , I was petrified with fear about returning to the U.S. after so many years .
I hadnt worn a pair of jeans or shoes for such a long time that I couldnt imagine what it would be like .
I didnt want to ask Maharaj-ji what I should do in America , but all of a sudden I blurted out in anguish , Maharaj-ji !
How can I serve you in America ?

He looked at me with mock disgust and said , What is this ?
If you ask how you should serve then it is no longer service .
Do what you want .
I couldnt believe my ears .
How could doing what I wanted to do be of service to him ?
I didnt have that kind of faith .
I just sat there , stunned .
Then after a minute or so he looked over at me , smiling sweetly , and asked , So , how will you serve me ?

My mind was blank .
It was time for me to leave for Delhi , to catch the plane back to the States .
He was looking at me and laughing .
I bent down and touched his feet for the last time and when I looked up , he was beaming at me , So , how will you serve me in America ?
I felt like I was moving in a dream .
I floated across the courtyard and bowed to him one more time from a distance .
As I did , the words came to me , I will sing to you in America .
Soon afterwards , during the full moon in September , Neem Karoli Baba left his body .
Now he had to be found within .
The chanting , the meditation , the puja and all the wonderful time spent with Maharaj-ji turned out to be seeds that he himself had planted in my heart ... seeds that would keep growing and blossom by his Grace .
His album , Live Ananda was nominated for the 2013 Grammy Award for Best New Age Album .
He performed at the Grammy Awards Ceremony as well .
Krishna Das composed the melody for the Anusara Yoga invocation , Om Nama Shivaya Gurave , at the request of John Friend , founder of Anusara Yoga .
Friend describes this composition as occurring during a summer night at a secluded mountain retreat center in Utah in 1998 .
In 2011 and 2012 , a documentary was made about Krishna Das called One Track Heart : The Story of Krishna Das .
It was directed by filmmaker Jeremy Frindel and features interviews with Krishna Das as well as others commenting on his life and spiritual quest .
In late 2012 the documentary was picked up by distributor Zeitgeist Films for US distribution , and it came out in the USA in May 2013

Pandit Ulhas N Kashalkar is a Hindustani classical vocalist .
He has received training in the Gwalior , Jaipur and Agra gharanas , and is considered a representative of all three schools .
Pandit Ulhas Kashalkar was born in Nagpur .
He received his first lessons in music from his father N D Kashalkar , a lawyer by profession and an amateur vocalist and musicologist .
He went on to study music at Nagpur University , topping his post-graduate class .
Around that time , he trained under Rajabhau Kogje and P N Khardenavis .
Indian music is heavily influenced by the Guru-shishya tradition .
Kashalkar studied principally under Pandit Ram Marathe and Gajananrao Joshi .
Ram Marathe , popularly referred to as Rambhau , was a vocalist in the Gwalior tradition .
He was a disciple of Master Krishnarao , who in turn studied under the legendary Bhaskarbuwa bakhale , a key figure in the history of the Gwalior gharana .
Pandit Marathe also trained in the Agra style for fifteen years under Jagannathbua Purohit .
That apart , he was a prominent actor and music director in the Marathi stage .
Kashalkar undertook a long period of tutelage under him .
Indeed , most characteristic features of his style can be traced to Gajananraos vocalism .
Ulhas Kashalkar initially worked as a programme executive at the Thane station of All India Radio .
In 1993 he became a Guru at the ITC Sangeet Research Academy , where he remains today .
Both Rambhau and Gajananrao were traditionalists which finds reflection in Kashalkars vocalism .
He possesses the ability to switch between three styles , at times even in the course of a single performance .
He adheres to the aesthetic contours of each individual style , and also to the formal demands of the raga being presented .
He is noted for his authentic presentations of obscure traditional ragas .
In an uncharacteristically expansive passage , the veteran music critic Prakash Wadhera once noted : .
Ulhas is a fabulous vocalist , still in his middle years and young , who has an old musical head stuffed with innumerable current and rare ragas and compositions .
Like a computer he never errs in any raga or composition howsoever intertwined or tricky it may be .
He , just seems to press one key and out comes a raga in the true Jaipur colours , another to obtain a melody attired in the Agra style and still another to get a raga in the Gwalior habiliments .
One can only imagine Kashalkars questionless loyalty to his various gurus , and his own prodigious capacity to assimilate and consolidate the incoming knowledge .
Indian music today is witness to a situation where senior musicians fail to produce disciples of adequate merit .
Ulhas Kashalkar is an exception to this phenomenon .
As resident Guru at the ITC Sangeet Research Academy , he has mentored several excellent students

A jugalbandi or jugalbandhi is a performance in Indian classical music , especially the Hindustani classical music , that features a duet of two solo musicians .
The word jugalbandi means , literally , entwined twins .
The duet can be either vocal or instrumental .
Often , the musicians will play different instruments , as for example the famous duets between sitarist Ravi Shankar and sarod player Ali Akbar Khan , who played the format since the 1940s .
More rarely , the musicians may be from different traditions .
What defines jugalbandi is that the two soloists be on an equal footing .
While any Indian music performance may feature two musicians , a performance can only be deemed a jugalbandi if neither is clearly the soloist and nor clearly the accompanist .
In jugalbandi , both musicians act as lead players , and a playful competition exists between the two performers
Ragamala Paintings are a series of illustrative paintings from medieval India based on Ragamala or the Garland of Ragas , depicting various Indian musical modes , Ragas .
They stand as a classical example of the amalgamation of art , poetry and classical music in medieval India .
Ragamala paintings were created in most schools of India painting , starting in the 16th and 17th centuries and are today named accordingly , as Pahari Ragamala , Rajasthan or Rajput Ragamala , Deccan Ragamala , and Mughal Ragamala .
In these painting each raga is personified by a colour , mood , a verse describing a story of a hero and heroine , it also elucidates the season and the time of day and night in which a particular raga is to be sung ; and finally most paintings also demarcate the specific Hindu deities attached with the raga , like Bhairava or Bhairavi to Shiva , Sri to Devi etc. .
The paintings depict not just the Ragas , but also their wives , , their numerous sons and daughters .
The six principal ragas present in the Ragamala are Bhairava , Dipika , Sri , Malkaunsa , Megha and Hindola and these are meant to be sung during the six seasons of the year - summer , monsoon , autumn , early winter , winter and spring .
Sangeeta Ratnakara , is an important 12th century CE treatise on the classification of Indian Ragas , which for the first time mentions the presiding deity of each raga .
From the 14th century onwards , they were described in short verses in Sanskrit , for Dhyana , contemplation , and later depicted in a series of paintings , called the Ragamala paintings .
Some of the best available works of Ragamala are from the 16th and 17th centuries , when the form flourished under royal patronage , though by the 19th century , it gradually faded .
In 1570 , Kshemakarna , a priest of Rewa in Central India , compiled a poetic text on the Ragamala in Sanskrit , which describes six principal Ragas -- Bhairava , Malakoshika , Hindola , Dipaka , Shri , and Megha -- each having five Raginis and eight Ragaputras , except Raga Shri , which has six Raginis and nine Ragaputras , thus making a Ragamala family of 86 members .
Most of the extant works of Ragamala are from Deccan style , where Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur , was himself also a fine painter and illustrator , though some Rajput style also exist of which the work of an artist of the Chawand school of painting , Sahibdin , whose Ragamala series dated 1628 , are now in National Museum of India .
Six are male ragas ; the thirty raginis are their wives and the remaining forty-eight are their sons .
These are listed is as follows : .
Wives : Bhairavi , Bilawali , Punyaki , Bangli , Aslekhi .
Sons : Pancham , Harakh , Disakh , Bangal , Madhu , Madhava , Lalit , Bilaval .

Benares gharana is one of the six most common styles of playing of the Indian tabla .
The Benares tabla gharana was developed a little over 200 years ago by Ram Sahai .
Ram Sahai began studying the tabla with his father from the age of five .
At the age of nine , he moved to Lucknow to become the disciple of Modhu Khan of the Lucknow gharana .
When Ram Sahai was seventeen years old , Wazir Ali Khan , the new Nawab , asked Modhu Khan if Ram Sahai could perform a recital for him .
Modhu Khan agreed , on the condition that Ram Sahai would not be interrupted until he finished playing .
It is said that Ram Sahai played for seven consecutive nights , and that after this incredible performance , Ram Sahai was praised by all the members of the community and was showered with gifts .
Shortly after this performance , Ram Sahai returned to Benares .
After some time performing in Benares , Ram Sahai felt the need to make a significant change in his tabla playing .
For six months , he withdrew into seclusion , and worked to develop what is now known as the Benares baj or style of tabla playing .
The philosophy behind this new style of tabla playing is that it would be versatile enough to perform solo , and to accompany any form of music or dance .
The tabla would be able to play delicately , as required for khyal , or more aggressively , like pakhawaj , for the accompaniment of dhrupad or kathak dance .
Ram Sahai developed a new way of fingering the tabla strokes ; especially important is the sound Na , being played with a curved ring finger to allow for maximum resonance of the dahina .
He also composed numerous compositions within existing compositional forms and created new forms , such as uthan , Benarsi theka , and fard .
Sharda Sahai was the 5th generation of tabla players in the family .
Sanju Sahai , also known as Vishnu , is the current Head of the Benaras Gharana and represents the 6th generation and is one of the most sought after Tabla players of his generation .
Both are the direct descendents of Ram Sahai .
Today , the Benares tabla gharana is well known for its powerful sound , though Benares players are also very capable of playing delicately and sensitively .
The gharana is categorized into the Purbi baj , which includes the Farukhabad , Lucknow , and Benares gharanas .
The Benares style makes use of the more resonant strokes of tabla , such as Na , and Din .
Benares players preferentially use the full-hand TeTe strokes , rather than the single finger alternation preferred by the Delhi style , though both stroke types are integrated into the Benares baj repertoire .
Benares tabla players are successful in all forms of tabla playing , including tabla solo , instrumental , vocal , and dance accompaniment .
The Tabla solo is highly developed in the Benares gharana , and some artists , such as Anokhelal Mishra , Kishan Maharaj , and Pandit Samta Prasad , have become famous as tabla soloists .
The direct descendants making up the 6th generation of tabla players are Chandra Nath Shastri , Ramji Mishra , Mahapurush Misra , Ishwarlal Mishra , Chhotelal Misra , Radhakanta Nandi , Kashinath Mishra , Bityut Banerjee , Deepak Sahai , Sanju Sahai and Shiv Sahai .
The 7th generation consists of Kumar Bose , Aditya Sahai , Krishna Sahai and Shubham Sahai .
Other noted artist include Kanthe Maharaj , uncle and Guru of Kishan Maharaj , and whose disciples were Badri Maharaj , Ashutosh Bhattacharya .
The Benares baj makes use of over twenty different compositional types , and has an enormously varied repertoire of each type .
Reputed players from the gharana include Anokhelal Mishra , Ramji Mishra , Kishan Maharaj , Samta Prasad , Mahapurush Misra , Chandra Nath Shastri , Ashutosh Bhattacharya and Sharda Sahai
A shruti box is a small wooden instrument that traditionally works on a system of bellows .
It is similar to a harmonium and is used to provide a drone in a practice session or concert of Indian classical music .
It is used as an accompaniment to other instruments and notably the flute .
Use of the shruti box has widened with the cross-cultural influences of world music and new age music to provide a drone for many other instruments as well as vocalists .
Adjustable buttons allow tuning .
Nowadays , electronic shruti boxes are commonly used , which are called shruti petti in Tamil and Telugu and sur peti in Hindi .
Before the arrival of the harmonium in India , musicians used either a tambura or a specific pitch reference instrument , such as the nadaswaram , to produce the drone .
Some forms of music such as Yakshagana used the pungi reedpipe as drone .
After the Western small pump harmonium became popular , musicians would modify the harmonium to automatically produce the reference pitch .
Typically , one would open up the cover and adjust the stop of the harmonium to produce a drone .
Later , a keyless version of the harmonium was invented for the specific purpose of producing the drone sound .
It was given the name shruti box or sruti box .
These instruments had controls on the top or on the side of the box for controlling the pitch .
The shruti box is enjoying a renaissance in the West amongst traditional and contemporary musicians who are using it for a range of different styles .
In the early nineties traditional Irish singer Noirin Ni Riain brought the shruti box to Ireland , giving it a minor place in traditional Irish music .
More recently Scottish folk artist Karine Polwart has championed the instrument , using it on some of her songs .
Singers find it very useful as an accompaniment and instrumentalists enjoy the drone reference it gives to play along with

After the musicians had tuned up on stage for over a minute , the crowd broke into applause , to which the amused Shankar responded : If you like our tuning so much , I hope you will enjoy the playing more .
Although interest in Indian music had decreased in the early 1970s , the concert album became one of the best-selling recordings to feature the genre and won Shankar a second Grammy Award .
During the 1970s , Shankar and Harrison worked together again , recording Shankar Family & Friends in 1973 and touring North America the following year to a mixed response after Shankar had toured Europe with the Harrison-sponsored Music Festival from India .

In time , Victoria became an accomplished singer , Kathak dancer and a courtesan in Banaras , and made a name for herself , as Badi Malka Jan ; she was called Badi because at that time three other Malka Jans were famous : Malka Jan of Agra , Malka Jan of Mulk Pukhraj and Malka Jan of Chulbuli , and she was the eldest among them .
Finally , Malka Jaan moved back to Calcutta in 1883 , and established herself in the courts of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah , who had settled at Matiaburj , near Kolkata and within three years purchased a building at 24 Chitpore Road , for Rs .40,000 .

Eventually , in her final days , she moved to Mysore , at the invitation of Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV of Mysore , and on August 1 , 1928 , she was appointed as a Palace musician , though she died within 18 months , on January 17 , 1930 in Mysore .

Her most famous song are , thumri sung in Bhairavi is Mora nahak laye gavanava , jabse gaye mori sud huna live , Ras ke bhare Tore Nain , Mere dard-e-jigar and Bhajans like , Radhey Krishna Bol Mukhse .

Cheez means composition in Indian classical music , especially in vocal music of Hindustani music .
Closely related to bandish or compositions for instrumental music .
E.g. Bol Taans can be sung by utilizing the words of the Cheez .
The main components are meaningful words , which are set in a raga structure correlating with a tala .
Therefore Cheez can be understood as a concept for realizing a musical idea , as a basis on which the artist explores further on the raga , which is mainly of improvisational character .
Nowadays Cheez finds its synonym in the term Vasta , which refers on its own to the plot of dramaturgic venture
William Rory Gallagher was an Irish blues-rock multi-instrumentalist , songwriter , and bandleader .
Born in Ballyshannon , County Donegal , and raised in Cork , Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the 1970s and 1980s , after forming the band Taste during the late 1960s .
He was a talented guitarist known for his charismatic performances and dedication to his craft .
Gallaghers albums have sold in excess of 30 million copies worldwide .
Gallagher received a liver transplant in 1995 , but died of complications later that year in London , UK at the age of 47 .
Gallagher was born in Ballyshannon , County Donegal ; his father , Daniel , was employed by the Irish Electricity Supply Board , who were constructing a hydro-electric power plant on the Erne River above the town .
The family moved , first to Derry City , where his younger brother Donal was born in 1949 , and then to Cork , where the two brothers were raised , and where Rory attended the North Monastery School .
Their father had played the accordion and sang with the Tir Chonaill Ceile Band whilst in Donegal ; their mother Monica was a singer and acted with the Abbey Players in Ballyshannon .
The Theatre in Ballyshannon where Monica once acted is now called the Rory Gallagher Theatre .
Both sons were musically inclined and encouraged by their parents .
At age nine , Gallagher received his first guitar from them .
He built on his burgeoning ability on ukulele in teaching himself to play the guitar and perform at minor functions .
After winning a talent contest when he was twelve , Gallagher began performing in his adolescence with both his acoustic guitar , and an electric guitar he bought with his prize money .
However , it was his purchase three years later of a 1961 Fender Stratocaster for PS100 that became his primary instrument and most associated with him for the span of his lifetime .
Gallagher was initially attracted to skiffle after hearing Lonnie Donegan on the radio .
Donegan frequently covered blues and folk performers from the United States .
He relied entirely on radio programs and television .
Occasionally , the jazz programs from the BBC would play some blues numbers , and he slowly found some song books for guitar , where he found the names of the actual composers of blues pieces .
While still in school , playing songs by Buddy Holly and Eddie Cochran , he discovered his greatest influence in Muddy Waters .
Subsequently , Gallagher began experimenting with folk , blues , and rock music .
Unable to find or afford record albums , Gallagher stayed up late to hear Radio Luxembourg and AFN where the radio brought him his only exposure to the actual songwriters and musicians whose music moved him most .
Influences he discovered , and cited as he progressed , included Woody Guthrie , Big Bill Broonzy , and Lead Belly .
Initially , Gallagher struck out after just an acoustic sound .
Singing and later using a brace for his harmonica , Gallagher taught himself to play slide guitar .
Further , throughout the next few years of his musical development , Gallagher began learning to play alto saxophone , bass , mandolin , banjo , and the coral sitar with varying degrees of proficiency .
By his mid-teens , he began experimenting heavily with different blues styles .
Gallagher began playing after school with Irish showbands , while still a young teenager .
In 1963 , he joined one named Fontana , a sextet playing the popular hit songs of the day .
The band toured Ireland and the United Kingdom , earning the money for the payments that were due on his Stratocaster guitar .
Gallagher began to influence the bands repertoire , beginning its transition from mainstream pop music , skirting along some of Chuck Berry s songs and by 1965 , he had successfully moulded Fontana into The Impact , with a change in their line-up into an R&B ; group that played gigs in Ireland and Spain until disbanding in London .
Gallagher left with the bassist and drummer to perform as a trio in Hamburg , Germany .
In 1966 , Gallagher returned to Ireland and , experimenting with other musicians back home in Cork , decided to form his own band .
Having completed a musical apprenticeship in the showbands , and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early 1960s , Gallagher formed The Taste , which was later renamed simply , Taste , a blues rock and R&B ; power trio , in 1966 .
Initially , the band was composed of Gallagher and two Cork musicians , Norman Damery and Eric Kitteringham , however , by 1968 , they were replaced with two musicians from Belfast , featuring Gallagher on guitar and vocals , drummer John Wilson , and bassist Richard McCracken .
Performing extensively in the United Kingdom , the group played regularly at the Marquee Club , supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert , and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America .
Managed by Eddie Kennedy , the trio released the albums Taste and On The Boards , and two live recordings , Live Taste and Live at the Isle of Wight .
The latter appeared long after the bands break-up , which occurred shortly after their appearance at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival .
After the break-up of Taste , Gallagher toured under his own name , hiring former Deep Joy bass player Gerry McAvoy to play on Gallaghers self-titled debut album , Rory Gallagher .
It was the beginning of a twenty-year musical relationship between Gallagher and McAvoy ; the other band member was drummer Wilgar Campbell .
The 1970s were Gallaghers most prolific period .
He produced ten albums in that decade , including two live albums , Live in Europe and Irish Tour 74 .
November 1971 saw the release of his album , Deuce .
In the same year he was voted Melody Maker s International Top Musician of the Year , ahead of Eric Clapton .
However , despite a number of his albums from this period reaching the UK Albums Chart , Gallagher did not attain major star status .
Gallagher played and recorded what he said was in me all the time , and not just something I turn on ... Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide , it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim .
He is documented in the 1974 film Irish Tour 74 , directed by Tony Palmer .
During the heightened periods of political unrest in Ireland , as other artists were warned not to tour , Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career , winning him the dedication of thousands of fans , and in the process , becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians .
Gallagher himself admitted in several interviews that at first there were not any international Irish acts until Van Morrison , Gallagher , and later , Phil Lynott and Thin Lizzy grew popular during the 1970s .
The line-up which included Rod deAth on drums and Lou Martin on keyboards , performed together between 1973 and 1978 .
However , he eventually dropped down to just bass , guitar and drums , and his act became a power trio .
Other releases from that period include Against the Grain , Calling Card , Photo-Finish and Top Priority .
Gerry McAvoy has stated that the Gallagher band performed several TV and radio shows across Europe , including Beat-Club in Bremen , Germany and the Old Grey Whistle Test .
He recorded two Peel Sessions , both in February 1973 and containing the same tracks , but only the first was broadcast .
Along with Little Feat and Roger McGuinn , Gallagher performed the first Rockpalast live concert at the Grugahalle , Essen , Germany in 1977 .
Gallagher collaborated with Jerry Lee Lewis and Muddy Waters on their respective London Sessions in the mid-1970s .
He played on Lonnie Donegans final album .
He was David Coverdale s second choice to replace Ritchie Blackmore in Deep Purple .
Gallagher chose to perform in his own band .
In the 1980s he continued recording , producing Jinx , Defender , and Fresh Evidence .
After Fresh Evidence , he embarked on a tour of the United States .
In addition he played with Box of Frogs -- a band formed in 1983 by former members of The Yardbirds .
Becoming obsessive over details and plagued by self-doubt , Gallagher nevertheless retained a loyal fanbase .
During this period he stated I agonize too much .

Gallagher was always associated with his well-worn sunburst 1961 Stratocaster , which his brother Donal has officially retired .
It was reputedly the first in Ireland , and was ordered from Fender by Jim Connolly , a showband member performing with The Irish Showband .
Connolly ordered a cherry red Stratocaster through Crowleys music shop in Cork in 1961 .
When Fender shipped a sunburst Stratocaster instead , it was put up on sale in 1963 as a second-hand instrument , which Gallagher bought in August 1963 for just shy of PS100 at Crowleys Music Store on Cork s McCurtain Street .
Speaking about Gallaghers purchase of the famous Stratocaster his brother Donal recalled : His dream ambition was to have a guitar like Buddy Holly ... This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument , it was 100 pounds ... in todays money you couldnt even compare you might as well say it was a million pounds ... my mother was saying well be in debt for the rest of our lives and Rory said well actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts , rhythm and lead , we wont need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off so the Stratocaster became his partner for life if you like .
The guitar was extensively modified by Gallagher .
The tuning pegs are odd , and all of these have been found to be replacements .
Second , it is thought that the nut has been replaced and interchanged a number of times .
Third , the scratchplate was changed during Gallaghers time with Taste .
The pick-ups -- none of which are original -- were also changed .
The final modification was that of the wiring : Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone pot and rewired it so he had just a master tone control along with the master volume control .
He also installed a 5-way selector switch in place of the vintage 3-way one .
The most notable effect that the years of touring have had on the guitar is the almost complete removal of its original sunburst finish .
Although the Strat was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin , this is not believed to have caused any ill effect .
All of the wear was caused by Rorys playing , not misuse .
A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered .
When the Strat was recovered after two weeks , Gallagher swore he would never sell it or paint it after that .
It also had a period of time of having a replacement neck , with the original neck bowing due to the amount of moisture it absorbed during continuous touring .
The neck was taken off and left to settle , and was eventually reunited with the Strat after returning to its correct shape .
Other quirks include a hump in the scratch plate which moves the neck pick-up closer to the neck on the bass side , and a replacement of all of the pick-ups , though this replacement was due to damage rather than the perception of a tonal inadequacy .
One final point of interest is that one of the clay double-dot inlays at the 12th fret fell out and was replaced with a plastic one , which is why its whiter than the other clay inlays .
On Friday the 21st and Saturday 22 October 2011 , Rorys brother Donal brought the guitar out of retirement to allow Joe Bonamassa to perform with it on his two nights at the London Hammersmith Apollo .
Joe opened both nights performances with his rendition of Cradle Rock using Rorys Stratocaster .
Photos and video of the performance can be seen on the official Rory Gallagher website .
Rorys biographer Marcus Connaughton believes the Strat was the key to Rorys sound .
Rory could talk about it all night .
` Its dated November 1961 - in certain peoples opinions this is when Fender hit their peak .
I like the maple neck .
Like on the earlier guitars , they 're probably a bit more crisp , but theres a warmth to this , a mellowness because of the rosewood neck .
This is the best , its my life , this is my best friend .
Its almost like knowing its weak spots are strong spots .
I do n't like to get sentimental about these things , but when you spend thirty years of your life with the same instrument its like a walking memory bank of your life there in your arms . '

When Gallagher was with Taste , he used a single Vox AC30 with a Dallas Rangemaster treble booster plugged into the normal input .
Examples of this sound can be heard on the Taste albums , as well as the album Live in Europe .
Brian May , of the band Queen , has admitted in interviews that as a young man , he was inspired to use a Vox AC30 and treble booster setup after meeting Gallagher and asking him how he got his sound .
The British company , Flynn Amps , now makes a Rory Gallagher Signature Hawk Treble Booster pedal based on Gallaghers original unit .
Gallagher also used Ibanez Tube Screamers , an MXR Dyna Comp , and various Boss effects , often using a Flanger and Octaver .
In the early to mid-1970s , Gallagher began to use Fender amplifiers in conjunction with a Hawk booster , most notably a Bassman and a Twin , both 1950s vintage .
An example of this sound can be heard on the Irish Tour 74 album .
He also had a Fender Concert amplifier .
In the mid to late 1970s , when Gallagher was moving towards a hard rock sound , he experimented with Ampeg VT40 and VT22 amps .
He also began using Marshall combos .
During this period and beyond , Gallagher used different combinations of amps on stage to achieve more power and to blend the tonal characteristics of different amps including Orange amplification .
On the introduction of the BOSS ME-5 all-in-one floor based FX unit , Rory was known to have been an early adopter and used it readily it for his live work up until his death in mid 90s .
Not that well known is his use of various German amplifiers .
He used Stramp 2100a amps , which can be seen in his appearances on the German Beat Club program .
Another company that hand built amplifiers for Gallagher was PCL Vintage Amp .
The company is located in St. Wendel in the Saarland and they still produce high quality audio and guitar equipment .
In the later years of his life Gallagher developed a phobia of flying .
To overcome this he received a prescription for a powerful sedative .
This medication , combined with his alcohol use resulted in severe liver damage .
Despite this he continued touring .
By the time of his final performance on 10 January 1995 in the Netherlands , he was visibly sick and the tour had to be cancelled .
Gallagher was admitted to Kings College Hospital in London in March 1995 , and it was only then that the extent of his ill health became apparent : his liver was failing and the doctors determined that in spite of his young age a liver transplant was the only possible course of action .
After 13 weeks in intensive care , while waiting to be transferred to a convalescent home , his health suddenly worsened when he contracted a staphylococcal infection , and he died on 14 June 1995 .
He was unmarried and had no children .
Gallagher was buried in St Olivers Cemetery , on the Clash Road just outside Ballincollig near Cork City , Ireland .
His headstone is a replica of an award he received in 1972 for International Guitarist of the Year .
In 2003 , Wheels Within Wheels , a collection of acoustic tracks , was released posthumously by Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher .
Collaborators on this album included Bert Jansch , Martin Carthy , The Dubliners and Lonnie Donegan .
Many modern day musicians , including The Edge from U2 , Slash of Guns N Roses , Johnny Marr of the Smiths , Davy Knowles , Janick Gers of Iron Maiden , Glenn Tipton of Judas Priest , Vivian Campbell of Def Leppard , Gary Moore and Joe Bonamassa , cite Gallagher as an inspiration in their formative musical years .
Brian May , lead guitarist of Queen , relates : so these couple of kids come up , whos me and my mate , and say How do you get your sound Mr. Gallagher ?
and he sits and tells us .
So I owe Rory Gallagher my sound .
In 2010 , Gallagher was ranked No. 42 on Gibson.coms List of their Top 50 Guitarists of All Time .
Gallagher was also listed on Rolling Stone magazines list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time , ranked at 57th place

West Meets East is an album by American violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Indian sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar , released in 1966 .
It was recorded following their successful duet in June 1966 at the Bath Musical Festival , where they had played some of the same material .
West Meets East won the 1967 Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance , the first time that an Asian musician had won a Grammy .
This recognition coincided with a period of heightened interest in Indian classical music , and particularly Shankar , as Western pop and rock bands such as the Beatles , the Byrds , the Rolling Stones and Traffic all adopted sitar or other aspects of the genre into their sound .
The album was the first in a trilogy of West Meets East collaborations by Menuhin and Shankar , volumes two and three appearing in 1968 and 1976 , respectively .
The friendship between the two musicians had begun in India in the early 1950s , after which Menuhin had done much to introduce Western audiences to Indian music .
On the recording , the main performers are accompanied at various points by tabla player Alla Rakha ; Menuhins sister , pianist Hephzibah Menuhin ; and Prodyot Sen , on tambura .
In addition to Shankars and Menuhins liner notes on the album sleeve , musician John Barham supplied a glossary , explaining musical terms such as alap , gat and tala .
At the Bath Festival , Barham had translated Shankars interpretation of Raga Tilang into Western annotation for Menuhins benefit .
When making West Meets East , Shankar rewrote this Tilang-based piece , recording it with Menuhin as Swara Kakali .
The albums opening selection is Prabhati , a Shankar composition based on Raga Gunakali , and played by Menuhin and Rakha .
The fourth selection , filling side two in the LP format , is Sonata for Violin & Piano No. 3 in A minor , Op. 25 , featuring Hephzibah Menuhin .
This piece was written by Romanian composer George Enescu , who had been Yehudi Menuhins teacher
Thumri is a common genre of semi - classical Indian music .
The text is romantic or devotional in nature , and usually revolves around a girls love for Krishna .
The lyrics are usually in Uttar Pradesh dialects of Hindi called Awadhi and Brij Bhasha .
Thumri is characterized by its sensuality , and by a greater flexibility with the raga .
Thumri is also used as a generic name for some other , even lighter , forms such as Dadra , Hori , Kajari , Saavan , Jhoola , and Chaiti , even though each of them has its own structure and content -- either lyrical or musical or both -- and so the exposition of these forms vary .
Like Indian classical music itself , some of these forms have their origin in folk literature and music .
Some of the most commonly used ragas are Pilu , Kafi , Khamaj , Gara , Tilak Kamod and Bhairavi .
The compositions are usually set to kaherava taal of 8 beats , addha tal of 16 beats , dipchandi of 14 beats or jat of 16 beats and in dadra tal of 6 beats .
Thumri arose in popularity during the 19th century in the Lucknow court of nawab Wajid Ali Shah .
At that time it used to be a song sung by courtesans accompanied by dance .
That was the bandish ki thumri or bol bant ki thumri .
When this style of thumri went out of vogue at the turn of the 20th century , a new style became more popular , which is known as bol banao , sung in Varanasi .
Since Varanasi is to the east of Lucknow , the new style became known as Poorab ang or eastern style thumri .
Famous artists of the Purab Ang thumri of the Benaras gharana or Banaras gayaki are Badi Motibai , Rasoolan Bai , Siddheshwari Devi , Girija Devi and Pandit Channulal Mishra .
Other famous singers of thumri are Gauhar Jan , Begum Akhtar , Shobha Gurtu , Noor Jehan and Prabha Atre .
Shobha Gurtu is often regarded as the thumri queen .
The bol banao style has a slow tempo and is concluded by a laggi , a faster phase where the tabla player has some freedom of improvisation .
Another stalwart in the genre of thumri was Naina Devi , who was married to a royal family but later devoted her life to the singing of the song of Tawaifs .
For a member of the royal family to take such a step in those days meant fighting countless social stigmas that had enough power to totally alienate someone from the society , but she had the support of her husband .
Some khyal singers took an interest in thumri and sang it their own way , as in the case of Abdul Karim Khan , Nazakat-Salamat Ali Khan , Barkat Ali Khan , Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , Bhimsen Joshi , and Prabha Atre .
Today thumri is sometimes sung at the end of khyal concerts as a concluding item .
Besides the tabla and the tanpura , other typical instruments in thumri are sarangi , and swarmandal .
Thumri singers pay considerable attention to the lyrics , though they may be difficult to follow in the ornamented enunciation .
This is especially where the focus is on love , and many lyrics deal with separation or viraha .
Krishnas ras leela or love play with Radha and other gopis of Vrindavan appear frequently .
As an example , here are the lyrics of a thumri composed by the medieval poet Lalan , celebrating Krishnas flute - how its tunes are driving Radha mad .
Braj or Vrindavan is where Krishna is indulging in this love play ; Radha is the girl of Braj
West Meets East , Volume 2 is an album by American violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Indian sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar , released in 1968 .
It is the second album in a trilogy of collaborations between the two artists , after the Grammy Award - winning West Meets East .
The release followed Menuhin and Shankars duet on 10 December 1967 at the United Nations in New York , celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
As part of his utopian ideal , international human rights was a cause long supported by Menuhin in his work , while for Indian classical music , this Human Rights Day recital marked the first time that a performance had received a worldwide television broadcast .
Reflecting the celebrity status afforded the sitarist during this period , particularly as a result of his association with George Harrison of the Beatles , Shankars activities were filmed for a documentary on his life , released as Raga in 1971 , and his autobiography My Music , My Life became a bestseller .
Although West Meets East , Volume 2 was another popular success for Menuhin and Shankar , their work together drew further criticism from purists in India , who considered that Shankar was westernising and thus diluting Indian classical music .
The album contains a version of the piece played at the United Nations , an interpretation of Raga Piloo .
According to Shankars comments to Rolling Stone magazine in March 1968 , they recorded this selection just a few days ago .
As at the recital , Menuhin and Shankar were accompanied by Alla Rakha on tabla and Kamala Chakravarty , Shankars female companion , on tambura .
The second piece is Raga Ananda Bhairava , performed by Shankar with his regular accompanist and instrument-maker , Nodu Mullick , on tambura , and Rakha again on tabla .
Side two in the original LP format consists of Menuhin and his sister Hephzibah performing Bartok s Sonata No. 1 for Violin and Piano
Viram Jasani is a Kenyan-born Indian sitar and tabla composer and musician .
He is known notably as having played tabla drums on the song Black Mountain Side from Led Zeppelin s 1969 debut album .

Indore gharana is one of the vocal gharanas of Indian classical music .
It was founded by Ustad Amir Khan , who studied the styles of Abdul Wahid Khan , Aman Ali Khan , Rajab Ali Khan and Abdul Karim Khan and amalgamated the essence of the styles of these four maestros with his own intellectual approach to music , and conceived the Indore gharana of music .
Amir Khan grew up in Indore , but he did not like the factionalism inherent in the gharana tradition .
In an interview to Akashvani Indore he said .
Performances in the Indore gharana are noted by the vilambit tempo in the styele of Abdul Wahid Khan , and the taans reminiscent of Rajab Ali Khan .
The merukhand structure is similar to that practiced by Ustad Aman Ali Khan of the Bhendibazaar gharana .
The khayal gayaki in the Indore gharana retains the slow development and restraint from frills as in the dhrupad .
Mohan Nadkarni says of Amir Khans music that whereas Bade Ghulam Ali Khan s music was extroverted and exuberant , Amir Khans was an introverted , dignified darbar style .
Amir Khans conviction about the importance of poetry in khyal compositions , has also marked the singing of the Indore gharana .
After Amir Khans death in a car accident in Kolkata in 1974 , the Indore gharana has become a powerful stream in modern Hindustani music .
Direct disciples of Amir Khan included Pandith Amarnath , Shankar Lal Mishra , Kankana Banerjee , Purvi Mukherjee , and others .
However , a number of influential musicians including Sultan Khan have grown up in its folds

Mohanrao Palekar was a noted Hindustani classical vocalist and is considered a stalwart of Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana , commonly referred as Jaipur Gharana .
Mohanrao was born in a musically oriented middle class family .
He somehow waited patiently till he completed the matriculation examination and then left home to pursue his aspirations in the field of music and stage performances .
Like many marathi singers , Mohanrao moved to Hindustani Classical Music via Natya Sangeet .
He first joined Bharat Natak Mandali as a stage actor .
Here Mohanrao was not getting any opportunities to showcase his natural musical talent .
Later , he worked with Govindrao Tembe s Shivraj Natak Mandali , and there his talent got new opportunity and direction .
While working at the Shivaraj Natak Mandali , Mohanrao met Ahmed Khan sahib from Alladiya Khan sahibs gharana ; Ahmed khan sahib was the grandson of Alladiya Khan Sahibs guru Jehangir Khan Sahib .
Ahmed Khan sahib was well trained in the traditional gharana style but was not a very well known singer because of his indifferent attitude .
However , Mohanrao recognized Ahmed Khan sahibs talent and became his disciple .
Needless to say that Mohanrao got taleem in the truest tradition of the gharana .
He also got ample opportunities to listen to great musicians ad libitum .
He was well known for creating style and technique of the Jaipur gayaki .
Despite the training and the talent , Mohanrao could not pursue his aspirations to be a fulltime classical music exponent due to family and other considerations ; his performances were mostly confined to private mehfils .
Therefore , he was not widely known to the general public .
However , he was very highly revered among the knowledgeable and cognoscenti musicians , artists and listeners .
His disciples include Pt .
Ratnakar Pai , Manohar Potdar , Pt .
G. T. Tilak , Krishnarao Chonakar , Kishori Amonkar , Kamal Pathare , Suresh Haldankar , Bhalchandra Patekar etc. .

Ganayogi Panchakshara Gawai was a blind singer from Gadag , a town in southern state of Karnataka , India .
He was born at Kadashettihalli in Hangal Taluk , Karnataka .
His school Veereshwara Punyashrama was a premier learning center for Hindustani Music .
The Kannada film Ganayogi Panchakshari Gavayi is based on his real life incidents
In Hindustani music , meend refers to a glide from one note to another .
It is an essential performance practice , and is used often in vocal and instrumental music .
On the veena , sitar , and other plucked stringed instruments , it is usually done by pushing the strings across the frets to vary their effective length and tension ; compare portamento and finger vibrato .
It is considered a sort of alankar , or ornament .
Meend is important part of any classical performance , however it is a technique not possible on a hand-held harmonium often used in musical concerts , traditionalist singing khyal prefer an accompaniment like sarangi
The sitar is a plucked stringed instrument used mainly in Hindustani music and Indian classical music .
The instrument descended from long-necked lutes taken to Pakistan from Central Asia and is also believed to be influenced by the Veena .
The sitar flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries and arrived at its present form in the 18th century Mughal period .
It derives its distinctive timbre and resonance from sympathetic strings , bridge design , a long hollow neck and a gourd resonating chamber .
Used widely throughout the Indian subcontinent , the sitar became known in the western world through the work of Ravi Shankar beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
The sitar saw further use in popular music after the Beatles featured the sitar in their compositions Norwegian Wood , Within You Without You , Tomorrow Never Knows and Love You To .
Their use of the instrument came as a result of George Harrisons taking lessons on how to play it from Shankar and Shambhu Das .
Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones also used a sitar in Paint It Black and a brief fad began for using the instrument in pop songs .
The Hindi word sitar originally derives from Persian seh + tar , literally meaning three strings .
The instrument descended from Central Asia to North India during the Delhi Sultanate period and is also believed to be influenced by the Veena .
The first prototype instruments were invented during the Delhi Sultanate period of the 13th/14 century when the Persian patrons of music and poetry encouraged innovation in Indian art .
It is named after a Persian instrument called the setar .
Hazrat Amir Khusro , the great Sufi musical and poetic genius , laid the foundation for its development .
The sitar flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries and arrived at its present form in the 18th century Mughal period .
In his Bharatiya Sangeet Vadya Dr. Lalmani Misra traces the instruments development from the Tritantri veena through the nibaddh and anibaddh Tamburas also called tanbur and later the jantra .
Construction of the similar tanpura was described by Tansen .
During the time of Moghul Empire in the Indian subcontinent from about 1526 to 1857 .
Persian lutes were played at the Mughal court and may have provided a basis of the sitar ; however , there is no physical evidence for the sitar until the time of the collapse of the Mughal Empire between 1690 and 1720 .
For comparison , lute-like instruments were depicted in Ancient Egyptian tomb paintings dated to the 18th Dynasty , so possibly predating evolution of the Sitar by 3,000 years .
A sitar can have 18 , 19 or 20 strings .
Six or seven of these are played strings which run over curved , raised frets , and the remainder are sympathetic strings which run underneath the frets and resonate in sympathy with the played strings .
The frets are movable , allowing fine tuning .
The played strings run to tuning pegs on or near the head of the instrument , while the sympathetic strings , which are a variety of different lengths , pass through small holes in the fretboard to engage with the smaller tuning pegs that run down the instruments neck .
The Gandhaar-pancham sitar has six playable strings , whereas the Kharaj-pancham sitar , used in the Maihar gharana , to which Ravi Shankar belongs , and other gharanas such as Bishnupur , has seven .
Three of these , called the chikaari , simply provide a drone ; the rest are used to play the melody , though the first string is most used .
The instrument has two bridges : the large bridge for the playing and drone strings and the small bridge for the sympathetic strings .
Its timbre results from the way the strings interact with the wide , sloping bridge .
As a string reverberates its length changes slightly as its edge touches the bridge , promoting the creation of overtones and giving the sound its distinctive tone .
The maintenance of this specific tone by shaping the bridge is called jawari .
Many musicians rely on instrument makers to adjust this .
The bridges are fixed to the main resonating chamber , or kaddu , at the base of the instrument .
Some sitars have a secondary resonator , the tumbaa , near the top of the hollow neck .
Materials used in construction include teak wood or tun wood , which is a variation of mahogany , for the neck and faceplate , and gourds for the resonating chambers .
The instruments bridges are made of deer horn , ebony , or very occasionally from camel bone .
Synthetic material is now common as well .
There are three popular modern styles of sitar offered in a variety of sub-styles and decorative patterns .
The two popular styles are the gayaki style sitars and the full decorated instrumental style sitars .
The gayaki style sitar is mostly of seasoned toon wood , with very few or no carved decorations .
It often has a dark polish .
The inlay decorations are mostly of mother of pearl .
The number of sympathetic strings is often limited to eleven but may extend to thirteen .
Jawari grinding styles are also different , as is the thickness of the tabli .
The other type of sitar , the instrumental style , is most often made of seasoned toon wood , but sometimes made of teak .
It is often fitted with a second resonator , a small tumba on the neck .
This style is usually fully decorated , with floral or grape carvings and celluloid inlays with colored and black floral or arabesque patterns .
It typically has thirteen sympathetic strings .
It is said that the best Burma teak sitars are made from teak that has been seasoned for generations .
Therefore instrument builders look for old Burma teak that was used in old colonial-style villas as whole trunk columns for their special sitar constructions .
The sources of very old seasoned wood are a highly guarded trade secret and sometimes a mystery .
There are various additional sub styles and cross mixes of styles in sitars , according to customer preferences .
Most importantly , there are some differences in preferences for the positioning of sympathetic string pegs .
Amongst all sitar styles there are student styles , beginner models , semi-pro styles , pro-models , master models , and so on .
Prices are often determined by the manufacturers name and not by looks alone or materials used .
Some sitars by certain manufacturers fetch very high collectible prices .
Most notable are older Rikhi Ram and older Hiren Roy sitars depending upon which master built the instrument .
Though not technically a sitar , the electric sitar is a guitar with a special bridge , known as the buzz bridge , and sympathetic strings , to mimic the sitar .
It has 6 strings , and lacks movable frets .
Tuning depends on the sitarists school or style , tradition and each artists personal preference .
The main playing string is almost invariably tuned a perfect fourth above the tonic , the second string being tuned to the tonic .
The tonic in the Indian solfege system is referred to as sadja , sadaj , or the shortened form sa , or kharaj , a dialectal variant of sadaj , not as vad , and the perfect fifth to which one or more of the drones strings are tuned is referred to as pancam , not samvad .
The sympathetic strings are tuned to the notes of the raga being played : although there is slight stylistic variance as to the order of these , typically they are tuned : .
The player should re-tune for each raga .
Strings are tuned by tuning pegs , and the main playing strings can be fine-tuned by sliding a bead threaded on each string just below the bridge .
In one or more of the more common tunings the playable strings are strung in this fashion : .
In a Gandhar Pancham sitar , the bass or kharaj strings are removed and are replaced by a fourth chikari which is tuned to Ga. .
By playing the chikari strings with this tuning , one produces a chord .
To tune the sympathetic strings to raga Kafi for example : I Sa , vii ni I Sa , II Re , iii ga , III Ga , iv ma , V Pa , VI Dha , vii ni , I Sa , II Re , iii ga. .
There is a lot of stylistic variance within these tunings and like most Indian stringed instruments , there is no default tuning .
Mostly , tunings vary by schools of teaching and the piece that is meant to be played .
The instrument is balanced between the players left foot and right knee .
The hands move freely without having to carry any of the instruments weight .
The player plucks the string using a metallic pick or plectrum called a mizraab .
The thumb stays anchored on the top of the fretboard just above the main gourd .
Generally only the index and middle fingers are used for fingering although a few players occasionally use the third .
A specialized technique called meend involves pulling the main melody string down over the bottom portion of the sitars curved frets , with which the sitarist can achieve a seven semitone range of microtonal notes .
Adept players bring in charisma through use of special techniques like Kan , Krintan , Murki , Zamzama etc. .
They also use special Mizrab Bol-s , as in Misrabani and create Chhand-s even in odd-numbered Tal-s like Jhoomra .
The Sitar Maestro Vilayat Khan had been touring outside India off and on for more than 50 years , and was the first Indian musician to play in England after independence and to introduce the sitar to world audiences .
Then in the late 1950s and early 1960s Ravi Shankar along with his musical partner on Tabla Alla Rakha began a further introduction of Indian classical music to the West .
The Kinks top 10 single See My Friends featured a low tuned drone guitar which was widely mistaken to be the instrument .
The sitar saw further use in popular music after the Beatles featured the sitar in their compositions Norwegian Wood , Within You Without You and Love You To .
Their use of the instrument came as a result of George Harrisons taking lessons on how to play it from Shankar and Shambhu Das .
Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones also used a sitar in Paint It Black and a brief fad began for using the instrument in pop songs .
Led Zeppelin s Jimmy Page talked about his love of Indian music , saying lets put it this way ; I had a sitar before George Harrison ... I went to India after I came back from a tour with the Yardbirds , I had been listening to Indian music for quite a while and wanted to hear it first hand .
The East Indian scales used on the track Friends Kashmir are considered fine examples of the influence of the sitar in rock music .
The Doors extensively used Indian and near eastern scales in their psychedelic soundscapes .
Robbie Kriegers guitar playing in The End is saturated in sitar melodic influence .
Psychedelic music bands often used new recording techniques and effects and drew on non-Western sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music .
The Electric Prunes appeared in early ads for the Vox Wah wah pedal , which touted the effects ability to make an electric guitar sound like a sitar .
Psychedelic influences spread into folk , rock , and soul , creating the subgenres of psychedelic folk , psychedelic rock , psychedelic pop and psychedelic soul in the late 1960s before declining in the early 1970s .
Psychedelic music bands expanded their musical horizons , and went on to create and/or influence many new musical genres including progressive rock , kosmische musik , synth rock , jazz rock , heavy metal , glam rock , funk , electro and bubblegum pop .
Psychedelic music was revived in a variety of forms of neopsychedelia from the 1980s onwards , and re-emerged in electronic music in genres including acid house , trance music and new rave
Gualberto Garcia Perez is a musician credited with creating Flamenco Fusion , also called Rock Andaluz .

His maternal grandfather was a jack-of-all-trades who sung Flamenco , nicknamed Currillo el Calentero .
His Mother , Pastora Perez Peral , was an amateur flamenco singer well-regarded by her neighbors .
Gualberto entered the Salesians school where his two passions in life were formed : football and music .
Under the attentive guidance of Don Pedro , his early mentor at the Salesians school , Gualberto and his classmates went on to become part of the local lore of Triana when his entire school football team was absorbed into the professional Real Betis Balompie soccer club .
Gualberto would reach the All-Andalusian team and others , like Quino , would go so far as to play for the Spanish national football team .
At the age of 17 , Gualberto quit football to dedicate himself to music , forming the rock group The Bats , which was followed in 1967 by Smash , a group which pioneered Spanish and Andalusian Rock history .
After disbanding the group , Gualberto left Spain for the US to study music , alongside his first wife , Jessica Jones Carson , an American from New York City .
There , he began to establish himself as a composer .
His first work was the rock opera Behind Stars ; in cooperation with the Good Vibrations Studio and the Yoga Symphony Orchestra , he formed a group for it with the famous Hindu sitar player Diwan Mothihar .
This first solo recording has not been released yet .
His early works feature the voice and lyrics of his first wife .
Returning to Spain he published two solo albums : A la vida al dolor and Vericuetos .
In 1976 he spent several months in France and the Netherlands , composing chamber music , which would lead to his next record : Otros dias .
Between 1976 and 1979 he arranged and collaborated several projects , rock and flamenco compositions , which were all brought together on Inquietudes a compas , re-released in 1997 .
In 1979 he recorded a fusion album between cantejondo songs and sitar called Gualberto and Agujetas .
During this decade he made mostly orchestration arrangements , such as flamenco and classical instrumentation .

In 1983 , after some memorable concerts with Ricardo Mino , he is asked to record once more live with Ricardo Mino , which resulted in the album , Puente Magico .
In 1987 , Gualberto started getting involved with musical computer science , which prompted the creation of his own studio , which he uses mainly to create music for cinema and television .
In 1990 he returned to the performing scene , touring for a long summer .
From this period , the first Cycle of the New Music at the University of Seville stands out .
Also from this period is the album Sin Commentario , released later by Lost Vinyl in 1996 .

The Mewati Gharana is an apprenticeship clan and musical family of Hindustani classical music founded in the late 19th century by Utd .
Ghagge Nazir Khan of Jodhpur .
With its own distinct aesthetic and stylistic views and practices , the gharana is an offshoot of the Gwalior Gharana and acquired its name after the region from which its founding exponent hailed : the Mewat region of Rajasthan .
The gharana gained visibility and following the latter-half of the 20th Century after acclaimed contemporary vocalist Pt .
Jasraj became popular in the realm of Hindustani Classical music at the same time and is viewed as a figure who revived and popularized the gayaki .
The musical ancestors of Ghagge Nazir Khan , the fountainhead of the Mewati Gharana , were exponents and descendants of the Gwalior Gharana .
In seeking musical patronage , these descendants of the Gwalior style separated from their original clan and settled in what is now western and southern Rajasthan .
Being isolated from the mainstream Gwalior musicians , the Rajasthan-based branch of the Gharana developed new stylistic forms and aesthetic principles as a result of separation .
Eventually , these changes resulted in the Mewati gayaki and became distinct although reminiscent of the Gwalior style .
It is for this reason that the Mewati Gharana is considered both musically and genealogically different from the Gwalior style .
Ghagge Nazir Khan passed on his musical tradition to his foremost disciples , Pandit Natthulal and Chimanlal Pandit .
Natthulal passed the tradition onto his nephew , Pandit Motiram who shared this tradition with his brother , Jyotiram Pandit around the start of the 20th century .
During this period , Mewati musicians were under monarchical patronage for their music .
Jyotiram later became a disciple of Rajab Ali Khan , bringing elements of the Jaipur and Kirana gayakis into the Mewati style .
Motiram passed this tradition to his sons , Pandit Maniram and Pratap Narayan Pandit .
After Motirams unprecedented and untimely demise , Maniram and Pratap Narayan were instrumental in grooming their younger brother , Jasraj , in the Mewati tradition after Jasraj renounced playing Tabla , his primary training at the time .
Influenced by the music of Amir Khan and Begum Akhtar , Jasraj introduced new stylistic elements into the traditional Mewati style , producing a more emotive , devotional , rhythmic-conscious , and lyric-conscious style .
Although it has ancestry in the style and trends of the Gwalior gharana , the Mewati Gharana gayaki has some distinct qualities .
Through Sufi and Kirtankar influence , the Mewati Gharana gayaki includes theistic and spiritual elements , where religious verses from Hinduism and Shia Islam especially Ismailism are incorporated not only in the grammatical content of the music , but as an intrinsic elements in musical development , some contemporary compositions invoke the name and attributes of Mawlana Shah Karim al-Hussaini Aga Khan as the manifest Imam and the tenth incarnation of Lord Vishnu according to the Dashavatara .
The verse Om Shri Anant Hari Naaraayan is typically invoked as the initiation of a performance , and as the grammatical medium for an Alap .
Elements of Hinduism and Shia Islam are simultaneously and polytheistically incorporated throughout musical works .
Mewati gayaki includes substantial use of sargam and tihais .
In a crude sense , the approach to Taankari is similar to the Patiala Gayaki and Tappa Gayaki in execution but is closer to the Gwalior gayaki in application .
Several ragas unique to the Mewati Gharana include Jaiwanti Todi , Din Ki Puriya , Odhav Bageshree , Khamaj Bahar and Bhavani Bahaar .
Pt .
Jasraj has added many devotional compositions to the Gharana repertoire , the most popular being , Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya in Bhimpalasi

Gopal Shankar Misra was an Indian musician and music teacher , who played the vichitra veena .
Misras father , Lalmani Misra , was born in the 1920s and became a singer and instrumentalist who performed dhrupad and khyal , and played the tabla , the sitar , and revived the vichitra veena by creating playing-technique for it .
In his early years he had toured the globe as music-director to dance troupe of Pt .
Uday Shankar .
Dr. Lalmani Misra was a performing musician and an academic , who served as Dean of the Faculty of Performing Arts at Banaras Hindu University , where he worked as a teacher and administrator , until his death in 1979 .
This left the 22-year-old Gopal a challenge of work unfinished .
The family eventually attained Gharana status when the third generation - Gopal and Padmajas son and daughter , Gandharva and Shruti - began to excel at the veena .
It was much later on that the Uday Shankar connection was to resurface a generation later , when Gopal was invited to join the 1998 UK touring and Real World recording project made by State of Bengal and Ananda Shankar , Uday Shankars son .
Gopal was born in Kanpur , India in 1957 .
His sister , Ragini , was born some years later .
His mother was Padma .
Surrounded by and growing up with music , his interest deepened following an international tour with his father .
He had studied vocal music and sitar since the age of four and was interested in cricket and other sports .
At the age of 15 his interest in music turned serious .
His father introduced his son in 1975 at Varanasi .
Chhotelal Mishra disciple of Pandit Anokhelal Mishra , accompanied Gopal who performed a rendering of Marwa , Chandrakauns and Pahadi on sitar .
Gopals mother died of cancer on 5 April 1977 .
His father , Lalmani Misra , took the children around the country , performing and meeting academics and musicians .
As a visiting Professor at Penn University , Misra had to leave for a semester .
He recorded ample music lessons for Gopal and Ragini so that both excelled in their respective examinations .
On his return , he developed an ache in his back and had to rely more on his children .
Gopal and Ragini thereby received training in academics of music , which served them much later on .
After the passing away of his mother , Gopal had become devoted to his father and sister .
When his father died , he started training his first student while he himself was learning .
As time went by students traveled from all over to learn Sitar and Vichitra Veena .
His most dedicated disciple was his sister , Ragini .
Today Ragini is the sole exponent of Misrabani .
She plays the complex Misrabani compositions on Jhoomra Tal .
Ragini credits her brother for instilling the innovation of their father so well , that she can play the toughest of compositions almost instantaneously .
She presented 16 Pearls a non-stop string of sixteen compositions in sixteen different Raga-s , starting from sixteen consecutive beats on Trital .
Gopal Shankar also inspired his sister to take up another instrument - jal tarang when she was in school .
Ragini has also been recognized as the first woman player of jal-tarang following Sitar gatkari in her presentation .
At this juncture , his devotion to the Veena intensified .
In playing Vichitra Veena , he felt closer to his father and through this , was able to draw much comfort in the coming years .
Having observed his fathers chaste style of living , Gopal bid adieu to his natural youthful manner and strictly followed an ascetic like life-style .
At the age of 22 he was appointed lecturer in music at Banares Hindu University and shortly afterward became Doctor of Music in Sitar .
He had also studied Sanskrit for his M.A. degree .
Over the years he became a Grade A Indian musician , making several radio recordings and giving concerts , while encouraging a number of students to take up veena .
Teaching at Banaras Hindu University exposed him to many potential learners .
Having inherited the art of imparting tid-bits of skill as well as wisdom about the swaroop of Raga , he had already taught his sister Ragini while still a student himself .
Now , his ability to teach with patience was fully exploited .
His students were not limited to a single instrument .
Kamala Shankar played guitar while Taranga Vilasini sports a santoor .
Students from Korea , Sri Lanka , Canada , France , Germany etc. would come to Varanasi to learn with him .
He was equally at home with theory and demonstration , and would often repeat his fathers advice , Dont discuss , do it .
Completely at home with technology , his visual sensibility were equally strong .
He would capture finger movements and other postures accurately on video , which proved immensely useful to his students .
All his students would record their sessions with him and return only after they had perfected the phrase or melody .
His teaching was effective as it was inspiring .
Many of Gopal Shankars students are now teaching music at various levels .
He toured extensively in India , USA and Europe and was fulfilling his fathers wishes by introducing the instrument to new situations and audiences .
It was through Gopal Shankar Misra that the vichitra veena finally found wider international fame .
The veena is associated with Saraswati , the Goddess of learning in Hindu mythology .
In Hindi vichitra means peculiar and the veena is part of a family of chordophone or stringed instruments said to predate the sitar .
It evolved from the ancient Ban and later was known as Batta-Been .
Gopal inherited the style known as Misrabani , from his father who had brought the instrument to prominence in Northern Indian music .
Gopal Shankar Misra was an acclaimed artiste of Sitar who was invited all across Indian and abroad .
But because Vichitra Veena held a special meaning for his father , he could not let it lie silent .
The vichitra veena is made of a broad , fretless , horizontal arm or crossbar around three feet long and six inches wide , with two large resonating gourds , which are inlaid with ivory and attached underneath at either end .
The narrow ends of the instrument are fashioned into peacock heads , the national bird of India - a most appropriate carving as Gopal often drew a metaphor between the colours in the birds tail and the musical range that the veena offers .
There are four main playing strings and five secondary strings , which are played openly with the little finger for a drone effect .
Underneath them are 13 sympathetic strings tuned to the notes of the appropriate raag .
The veena has a five-octave range .
Two plectrums identical to those used for sitar are worn on the middle and index fingers of the right hand to pluck the strings , and a glass ball is moved with the left across the main strings to create melody .
Olive oil or butter is put on the strings to ease the playing action .
The veena was often used to accompany the Dhrupad style of singing and this did not allow for much intricacy or embellishment around the notes .
Along with portamento passages where the notes glide effortlessly into each other , the dramatic and vigorous plucking style , the jumping from note to note , was a stylistic departure developed in Gopals family tradition , Misrabani .
Through the efforts of Gopal Shankar Misra , a course of D.Mus .
in Vichitra Veena was to be started by College of Music and Fine Arts , B.H.U. when his sudden demise at Bhopal on August 13 , 1999 while attending a function held in the memory of his father , Lalmani Misra bereaved besides his family , a number of existing and potential disciples .
He had authored the third part of Sangeet-Sarita , a series started by his father for middle-school students .
Adept in the school of Misrabani , he contributed to this true Tantrakari style through performance as well as composition .
A short article , Vichitra Veena : Innovations and Practices outlines his involvement and future plans for making this instrument more approachable .
His major work dealing with compositions of vocal and instrumental music together in a single volume is yet to see the light of day .
Those learning Vichitra Veena with him have turned to sister Ragini Trivedi who has been a guardian mentor to children , Shruti and Gandharva .

Talvin Singh Matharoo , is a producer and composer and tabla player , known for creating an innovative fusion of Indian classical music and drum and bass .
Singh is generally considered involved with an electronica sub genre called Asian Underground , and more recently as Indian and/or Asian electronica .
After collaborating with Siouxsie and the Banshees and Bjork in the early 1990s , Singh released his debut album Ok which received the Mercury Music Prize in 1999 .
Singh has since collaborated with a variety of acts including Madonna and Massive Attack .
Singh grew up in Leytonstone and began playing the tablas as a child .
At the age of 16 , Singh went to India for two years where he studied tabla under Pandit Lashman Singh .
He then returned to the UK after just one year .
In spite of this classical training , Singhs tabla playing was not accepted by British promoters of classical Indian music , as he incorporated too strongly his western influences .
By the late 1980s , Singh had decided to turn towards the fusion of sounds .
In 1991 , he came to prominence by both playing tabla and singing on the Kiss Them for Me single by Siouxsie and the Banshees : the single peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 at number 23 .
Singh then became the sixth member of the Banshees and took part with them as second headliners of the inaugural Lollapalooza tour .
Two years later in 1993 , he was recruited by Bjork to be her percussionist and director on her 1993s Debut album .
In late 1995 , Singh founded the Anokha club night with promoter Sweety Kapoor at East Londons Blue Note , where drumnbass DJs and South Asian punk bands went head to head with the amped-up sounds of his tabla and percussion .
Guest spots by LTJ Bukem and others made Anokha a Monday-night hotspot in London , and Singh signed to Island for an Anokha compilation including several of his own productions .
He worked as a remixer , for Blondie on their Maria single .
In 1998 , Singh released his solo debut album , Ok .
The record was critically acclaimed and received the prestigious Mercury Music Prize in 1999 .
That same year , he also collaborated with David Sylvian .
In 2000 , he worked with Madonna for her album , Music .
Singh is an accomplished Tabla player , electronic musician , music theorist , record producer and DJ .
As a solo artist , he is perhaps best known as the father of modern Asian electronica music , though he is also a highly celebrated tabla player , record producer and visual practitioner .
Drawing inspiration from the classical Indian arts , Singh first came to prominence as a tabla percussionist in the 1980s London music scene .
Whilst still in his mid-teens , Singh traveled to India to earn pupillage from Acharya Pandit Laxman Singh , master tabla maestro of the Punjab school .
This period made an indelible mark on the young artist and he has since continued to practice and perform the art form internationally .
Singh 's collaborations with Indian classical musicians include Ustad Sultan Khan , Rakesh Churasia , Ustad Imrat Khan and Ustad Amjad Ali Khan amongst scores of others .
Singh also became involved in experimental music collaborations beginning in the late 1980s , working with Sun Ra and Courtney , which helped to popularize the burgeoning Asian underground sub-culture movement .
Singh is notable for re-introducing the concepts of Indian classical music to western pop , dance and Jazz genres in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
Singh 's solo album credits include critical and commercial successes Ok -- which won the UK 's two most prestigious music prizes , ` The South Bank Prize ' and the Mercury Prize in 1999 .
Ok , his groundbreaking '98 debut release , was recorded in Mumbai , Madras , Okinawa , New York and London , featuring contributions from Bill Laswell , Ryuichi Sakamoto , Ustad Sultan Khan and the Madras Philharmonic Orchestra amongst others .
Singh has pursued several artistic ventures parallel to and in conjunction with his music career , including creating the seminal London club ANOKHA , performing at the Tate Gallery in London , creating a sound installation at the Frith Street Gallery in London and composing music for various experimental dance , theatre and film projects .
In 1990 Singh conceived the Tablatronic , a hybrid electronic/analog tabla which utilizes a rare internal microphone system .
In 2010 , Talvin Singh won an award at the UK Asian Music Awards for his Commitment to Scene
George Harrison , was an English musician , singer and songwriter who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles .
Although John Lennon and Paul McCartney were the bands primary songwriters , most of their albums included at least one Harrison composition , including While My Guitar Gently Weeps , Here Comes the Sun and Something , which became the Beatles second most-covered song .
Harrisons earliest musical influences included Big Bill Broonzy , George Formby and Django Reinhardt ; Chet Atkins , Chuck Berry and Ry Cooder were significant later influences .
By 1965 he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan , and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on Norwegian Wood .
He developed an interest in the Hare Krishna movement and became an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism , introducing them to the other members of the Beatles and their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music .
After the bands break-up in 1970 , Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass , from which two hit singles originated .
He also organized the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Ravi Shankar , a precursor for later benefit concerts such as Live Aid .
Harrison was a music and film producer as well as a musician ; he founded Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founded HandMade Films in 1978 .
Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer , and in 1988 co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys .
A prolific recording artist , he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger , Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston , and collaborated on songs and music with Bob Dylan , Eric Clapton and Tom Petty , among others .
Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time .
Harrisons first marriage , to Pattie Boyd , ended in divorce in 1977 .
The following year he married Olivia Trinidad Arias , with whom he had one son , Dhani .
Harrison died in 2001 , aged 58 , from lung cancer .
He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India , in a private ceremony according to Hindu tradition .
He left almost PS100 million in his will .
Born in Liverpool , Lancashire , England , on 25 February 1943 , Harrison was the youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves Harrison and his wife Louise .
He had one sister , Louise , and two brothers , Harry and Peter .
His mother was a shop assistant from a Catholic family with Irish roots , and his father was a bus conductor who had worked as a ships steward on the White Star Line .
His future wife , the model Pattie Boyd , described Harrisons parents as quite short and very Liverpudlian .
According to Boyd , Harrisons mother was particularly supportive : All she wanted for her children is that they should be happy , and she recognized that nothing made George quite as happy as making music .
An enthusiastic music fan , she was known among friends for her loud singing voice , which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons windows .
While pregnant with George , she often listened to the weekly broadcast Radio India .
Harrisons biographer Joshua Greene wrote , Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas , hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb .
Harrison was born and lived the first six years of his life at 12 Arnold Grove , Wavertree , Liverpool , in a terraced house in a cul-de-sac .
The home had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire .
In 1949 the family was offered a council house and moved to 25 Upton Green , Speke .
In 1948 , at the age of five , Harrison enrolled at Dovedale Primary School .
He passed his 11-plus examination and attended the prestigious Liverpool Institute from 1954 to 1959 .
Harrisons earliest musical influences included George Formby , Cab Calloway , Django Reinhardt , Hoagy Carmichael , and Big Bill Broonzy .
In early 1956 he had an epiphany : while riding his bicycle , he heard Elvis Presley s Heartbreak Hotel playing from a nearby house , and the song piqued his interest in rock and roll .
He often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in his schoolbooks , and later commented , I was totally into guitars .
Although apprehensive about his sons interest in pursuing a music career , in late 1956 Harrisons father bought him a Dutch Egmond flat top acoustic guitar .
A friend of his fathers taught Harrison how to play Whispering , Sweet Sue , and Dinah , and inspired by the music of Lonnie Donegan , Harrison formed a skiffle group called the Rebels with his brother Peter and a friend , Arthur Kelly .
On the bus to school Harrison met Paul McCartney , who became a member of John Lennon s band the Quarrymen , and the pair bonded over their shared love of music .
In March 1958 Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen at Rory Storm s Morgue Skiffle Club , playing Guitar Boogie Shuffle , but Lennon felt that Harrison , then 14 , was too young to join the band .
During a second meeting , arranged by McCartney , he performed the lead guitar part for the instrumental Raunchy on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus .
Soon afterwards he began socializing with the group , filling in on guitar as needed , and by the time he turned 15 they had accepted him as a member .
Although his father wanted him to continue his education , Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at Blacklers , a local department store .
In 1960 Allan Williams arranged for the band , now calling themselves the Beatles , to play at the Kaiserkeller club in Hamburg , owned by Bruno Koschmider .
The impromptu musical education Harrison received while playing long hours with the Beatles , as well as the guitar lessons he took from Tony Sheridan while they briefly served as his backing group , laid the foundations of his sound and of his quiet , professional role within the group ; he was later known as the quiet Beatle .
The bands first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs .
When Brian Epstein became their manager in December 1961 , he polished their image and secured them a recording contract with EMI .
The groups first single , Love Me Do , peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart , and by the time their debut album , Please Please Me , was released in early 1963 , Beatlemania had arrived .
Their second album , With the Beatles , included Dont Bother Me , Harrisons first solo writing credit .
By 1965s Rubber Soul , Harrison had begun to lead the other Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan , and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on Norwegian Wood .
He later called Rubber Soul his favourite album .
Revolver included three of his compositions : Taxman , Love You To and I Want to Tell You .
His introduction of the drone-like tambura part on Lennons Tomorrow Never Knows exemplified the bands ongoing exploration of non-Western instruments .
The tabla - driven Love You To was the Beatles first genuine foray into Indian music .
According to the ethnomusicologist David Reck , the song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody .
Harrison continued to develop his interest in non-Western instrumentation , playing swarmandal on Strawberry Fields Forever .
By late 1966 Harrisons interests had moved away from the Beatles , as reflected in his choice of Eastern gurus and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967 .
His sole composition on the album was the Indian-inspired Within You Without You , to which no other Beatle contributed .
He played sitar and tambura on the track , backed by musicians from the London Asian Music Circle on dilruba , swarmandal and tabla .
In 1968 his song The Inner Light was recorded at the EMI Studios in Bombay , featuring a group of local musicians playing traditional Indian instruments .
Released as the B-side to McCartneys Lady Madonna , it was the first Harrison composition to appear on a Beatles single .
Derived from a quotation from the Tao Te Ching , the songs lyric reflected Harrisons deepening interest in Hinduism and meditation , while musically it embraced the Karnatak discipline of Indian music , rather than the Hindustani style of his previous work in the genre .
Dylan and the Band were a major musical influence on Harrison at the end of his career with the Beatles .
He established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Bands sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members , in contrast with Lennon and McCartneys domination of the Beatles songwriting and creative direction .
This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and his growing desire to assert his independence from the band .
During the recording of The Beatles in 1968 , tensions ran high , and drummer Ringo Starr quit briefly .
Harrisons songwriting contributions to the album included While My Guitar Gently Weeps , which featured Eric Clapton on lead guitar , Piggies , Long , Long , Long , and Savoy Truffle .
Tensions among the Beatles surfaced again during the filming of rehearsals at Twickenham Studios in January 1969 for what became the album Let It Be .
Frustrated by the poor working conditions in the cold and sterile film studio , as well as by what he perceived as Lennons creative disengagement from the Beatles and a domineering attitude from McCartney , Harrison quit the group on 10 January , but agreed to return twelve days later .
Relations among the Beatles were more cordial , though still strained , during sessions for their final recorded album , Abbey Road .
The LP included two of Harrisons most respected Beatles compositions : Here Comes the Sun and Something , which became one half of the Beatles first double-sided number one single , Harrisons first A-side , and his first chart topper .
In 1969 Frank Sinatra recorded Something , and later dubbed it the greatest love song of the past fifty years .
Lennon considered it the best song on Abbey Road , and it became the Beatles second most covered song after Yesterday .
Author Peter Lavezzoli wrote : Harrison would finally achieve equal songwriting status ... with his two classic contributions to the final Beatles LP .
In April 1970 when Harrisons For You Blue was released in America as a double A-side with McCartneys The Long and Winding Road , it became the bands second chart-topping double A-side and For You Blue became Harrisons second number one hit .
His increased productivity and the Beatles reluctance to include his songs on their albums meant that by the time of their break-up he had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions .
While Harrison grew as a songwriter , his compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs , increasing his frustration , and significantly contributing to the bands break-up .
Harrisons last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970 , when he , McCartney and Starr recorded the Harrison song I Me Mine .
Before the Beatles break-up Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums : Wonderwall Music and Electronic Sound , both of which include mainly instrumental compositions .
Wonderwall Music , a soundtrack to the 1968 film Wonderwall , blends Indian and Western instrumentation , while Electronic Sound is an experimental album that prominently features a Moog synthesizer .
Released in November 1968 , Wonderwall Music was the first solo album by a Beatle and the first LP released by Apple Records .
Indian musicians Aashish Khan and Shivkumar Sharma performed on the album , which contains the experimental sound collage Dream Scene , recorded several months before Lennons Revolution 9 .
In December 1969 Harrison participated in a brief tour of Europe with the American group Delaney & Bonnie and Friends .
During the tour that included Clapton , Bobby Whitlock , drummer Jim Gordon and band leaders Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett , Harrison began to write My Sweet Lord , which became his first single as a solo artist .
Delaney Bramlett inspired Harrison to learn slide guitar , significantly influencing his later music .
After years of being restricted in his songwriting contributions to the Beatles albums , Harrison released All Things Must Pass .
It was a triple album , with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends .
Regarded by many as his best work , the album topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic .
The LP produced the number-one hit single My Sweet Lord and the top-ten single What Is Life .
The album was co-produced by Phil Spector using his Wall of Sound approach , and the musicians included Starr , Clapton , Gary Wright , Preston , Klaus Voormann , the whole of Delaney and Bonnies Friends band and the Apple group Badfinger .
Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described All Things Must Pass as being of classic Spectorian proportions , Wagnerian , Brucknerian , the music of mountain tops and vast horizons .
Author and musicologist Ian Inglis considered the lyrics of the albums title track a recognition of the impermanence of human existence ... a simple and poignant conclusion to Harrisons former band .
In 1971 Bright Tunes sued Harrison for copyright infringement over My Sweet Lord owing to its similarity to the 1963 Chiffons hit Hes So Fine .
He denied deliberately plagiarizing the song , but lost the court case in 1976 as the judge ruled that he had done so subconsciously .
In 2000 Apple Records released a thirtieth anniversary edition of the album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion , giving an interview during which he reflected on the work : Its just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles , really .
It was me sort of getting out of the Beatles and just going my own way ... it was a very happy occasion .
He commented on the production : Well , in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now .
In fact , I dont use reverb at all .
I cant stand it ... You know , its hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now .
Responding to a request from Ravi Shankar , Harrison organized a charity event , the Concert for Bangladesh , which took place on 1 August 1971 , drawing over 40,000 people to two shows in New Yorks Madison Square Garden .
The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the Bangladesh Liberation War .
Shankar opened the show , which featured popular musicians such as Dylan , Clapton , Leon Russell , Badfinger , Preston and Starr .
A triple album , The Concert for Bangladesh , was released by Apple Corps that year , followed by a concert film in 1972 .
Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds , but Harrison commented : Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation ... The money we raised was secondary , and although we had some money problems ... they still got plenty ... even though it was a drop in the ocean .
The main thing was , we spread the word and helped get the war ended .
The event has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed , including Live Aid .
Living in the Material World held the number one spot on the Billboard album chart for five weeks , and the albums single , Give Me Love , also reached number one in the US .
In the UK , the LP achieved number two , spending 12 weeks on the charts with the single peaking at number 8 .
The album was lavishly produced and packaged , and its dominant message was Harrisons Hindu beliefs .
In Greenes opinion it contained many of the strongest compositions of his career .
Rolling Stone Stephen Holden declared the album vastly appealing and profoundly seductive ... stands alone as an article of faith , miraculous in its radiance .
Other reviewers were less enthusiastic , describing the release as awkward , sanctimonious and overly sentimental , a reaction that left Harrison despondent .
In November 1974 Harrison began his 45-date Dark Horse Tour , becoming the first ex-Beatle to tour North America .
In addition to performances by Harrison with an ensemble of musicians such as Preston , Tom Scott , Willie Weeks , Andy Newmark and Jim Horn , the tour also included traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by Ravi Shankar , Family and Friends .
Despite numerous positive reviews the consensus reaction to the tour was negative , with complaints about the content , structure , and length ; the shows duration of two and a half hours was seen as excessive at the time .
Some fans found Shankars significant presence a bizarre disappointment , having expected to see only Harrison perform , and many were affronted by what Inglis described as Harrisons sermonizing .
Further , he reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs , and some of the substitutions were seen as gratuitously offensive .
His laryngitis - affected vocals also disappointed fans and critics , who began calling the tour dark hoarse .
Harrison was so deeply bothered by the caustic backlash that he did not tour again until the 1990s .
The author Robert Rodriguez commented : While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure , there were a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted .
They went away ecstatic , conscious that they had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeated .
Leng called the tour groundbreaking and revolutionary in its presentation of Indian Music .
In December Harrison released Dark Horse , an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career .
Rolling Stone called it the chronicle of a performer out of his element , working to a deadline , enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new LP product , rehearse a band , and assemble a cross-country tour , all within three weeks .
The album reached number 4 on the Billboard chart and the single Dark Horse reached number 15 , but they failed to make an impact in the UK .
The music critic Mikal Gilmore described Dark Horse as one of Harrisons most fascinating works - a record about change and loss .
Harrisons final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was the soul music - inspired Extra Texture .
He considered it the least satisfactory of the three he had recorded since All Things Must Pass .
Leng identified bitterness and dismay in many of the albums tracks ; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented : He wasnt up for it ... It was a terrible time because I think there was a lot of cocaine going around , and thats when I got out of the picture ... I didnt like his frame of mind .
He released two singles from the LP : You , which reached the Billboard top 20 , and This Guitar , Apples final original single release .
Thirty Three & 1/3 , Harrisons first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label , produced the hit singles This Song and Crackerbox Palace , both of which reached the top 25 in the US .
The surreal humour of Crackerbox Palace reflected Harrisons association with Monty Python s Eric Idle , who directed a comical music video for the song .
With an emphasis on melody and musicianship , and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works , Thirty Three & 1/3 earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since All Things Must Pass .
In 1979 , following his second marriage and the birth of his son Dhani , he released George Harrison .
The album and the single Blow Away both made the Billboard top 20 .
The album marked the beginning of Harrisons gradual retreat from the music business , and the fruition of ideas introduced on All Things Must Pass .
In 1978 the death of his father in May and the birth of his son in August had influenced his decision to devote more time to his family than to his career .
Leng described the album as melodic and lush ... peaceful ... the work of a man who had lived the rock and roll dream twice over and was now embracing domestic as well as spiritual bliss .
The murder of Lennon on 8 December 1980 disturbed Harrison and reinforced his decades-long concerns about stalkers .
It was also a deep personal loss , although unlike McCartney and Starr , Harrison had had little contact with Lennon in the years before his death .
Following the murder , Harrison commented : After all we went through together I had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon .
I am shocked and stunned .
Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had written for Starr to make it a tribute song to Lennon .
All Those Years Ago , which included vocal contributions from Paul and Linda McCartney , as well as Starrs original drum part , peaked at number two in the US charts .
The single was included on the album Somewhere in England in 1981 .
Harrison did not release any new albums for five years after 1982s Gone Troppo received little notice from critics or the public .
During this period he made several guest appearances , including a 1985 performance at a tribute to Carl Perkins titled .
In March 1986 he made a surprise appearance during the finale of the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert , an event organized to raise money for the Birmingham Childrens Hospital .
The following year , he appeared at The Princes Trust concert at Londons Wembley Arena , performing While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Here Comes the Sun .
In February 1987 he joined Dylan , John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a two-hour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal .
Harrison recalled : Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal ... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers - and had a few more ... Bob says , Hey , why dont we all get up and play , and you can sing ?
But every time I got near the microphone , Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear , trying to throw me .
In November 1987 Harrison released the platinum album Cloud Nine .
Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra , the LP included Harrisons rendition of James Rays Got My Mind Set on You , which went to number one in the US and number two in the UK .
The accompanying music video received substantial airplay , and another single , When We Was Fab , a retrospective of the Beatles career , earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988 .
Recorded at his estate in Friar Park , Harrisons slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album , which included several of his long-time musical collaborators , including Clapton , Keltner , and Jim Horn , who recalled Harrisons relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions : George made you feel at home , in his home ... He once had me sit on a toilet and play my soprano sax , and they miked it at the end of the hall for a distant sound .
I thought they were kidding ... Another time he stopped me in the middle of a sax solo and brought me 3 p.m. tea -- again I thought he was kidding .
Cloud Nine reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively , and several tracks from the album achieved placement on Billboards Mainstream Rock chart - Devils Radio , This Is Love and Cloud 9 .
In 1988 Harrison formed the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne , Roy Orbison , Bob Dylan and Tom Petty .
The band had gathered in Dylans garage to record a song for a Harrison European single release .
Harrisons record company decided the track , Handle with Care , was too good for its original purpose as a B-side and asked for a full album .
The LP , Traveling Wilburys Vol .
1 , was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as half-brothers , supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury , Sr. .
Harrisons pseudonym on the first album was Nelson Wilbury ; he used the name Spike Wilbury for their second album .
After Orbisons death in December 1988 the group recorded as a four-piece .
Their second release , issued in October 1990 , was mischievously titled Traveling Wilburys Vol .
3 .
According to Lynne , That was Georges idea .
He said , Lets confuse the buggers .
It reached number 14 in the UK , where it went platinum with certified sales of more than 3,000,000 units .
The Wilburys never performed live and the group did not record together again following the release of their second album .
In 1989 Harrison and Starr appeared in the music video for Tom Pettys song I Wont Back Down .
Starr is filmed playing the drums , but did not play on the track ; Harrison played acoustic guitar and provided backing vocals .
In December 1991 , Harrison joined Clapton for a tour of Japan .
It was Harrisons first since 1974 and no others followed .
On 6 April 1992 , Harrison held a benefit concert for the Natural Law Party at the Royal Albert Hall , his first London performance since the Beatles 1969 rooftop concert .
In October 1992 he performed at a Bob Dylan tribute concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City , playing alongside Dylan , Clapton , McGuinn , Petty and Neil Young .
In 1994 Harrison began a collaboration with McCartney , Starr and producer Jeff Lynne for the Beatles Anthology project .
This included the recording of two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon as well as lengthy interviews about the Beatles career .
Released in December 1995 , Free as a Bird was the first new Beatles single since 1970 .
In March 1996 , they released a second single , Real Love .
Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song .
He later commented on the project : I hope somebody does this to all my crap demos when Im dead , make them into hit songs .
Following the Anthology project , Harrison collaborated with Ravi Shankar on the latters Chants of India .
Harrisons final television appearance was a VH-1 special to promote the album , taped in May 1997 .
Soon after , he was diagnosed with throat cancer , and treated with radiotherapy , which was thought at the time to be successful .
In January 1998 , Harrison attended Carl Perkinss funeral in Jackson , Tennessee , performing a brief rendition of Perkinss song Your True Love .
In June 1998 , he attended the public memorial service for Linda McCartney , and appeared on Starrs album Vertical Man , playing guitar on two tracks .
On 30 December 1999 , 36-year-old Michael Abram broke into the Harrisons Friar Park home and attacked Harrison with a kitchen knife , puncturing a lung and causing head injuries before Olivia Harrison incapacitated the assailant by striking him repeatedly with a poker and a lamp .
Following the attack , Harrison was hospitalized with more than forty stab wounds .
He released a statement soon after regarding his assailant : wasnt a burglar , and he certainly wasnt auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys .
In May 2001 it was revealed that Harrison had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs , and in July , it was reported that he was being treated for a brain tumour at a clinic in Switzerland .
While in Switzerland , Starr visited him , but had to cut his stay short to travel to Los Angeles , where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery , prompting Harrison to quip : Do you want me to come with you ?
In November 2001 , he began radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City for lung cancer that had spread to his brain .
When the news was publicized , Harrison bemoaned his physicians breach of privacy , and his estate later claimed damages .
On 12 November , the three living former Beatles met for the last time at Harrisons hotel in New York for lunch .
Harrison died on 29 November 2001 , aged 58 , from metastatic non-small cell lung cancer .
He was cremated at Hollywood Forever Cemetery and his ashes were scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers near Varanasi , India , by his close family in a private ceremony according to Hindu tradition .
He left almost PS100 million in his will .
His final album , the posthumously released Brainwashed , was completed by his son Dhani and Jeff Lynne .
Included in the albums liner notes is a quotation from the Bhagavad Gita : There never was a time when you or I did not exist .
Nor will there be any future when we shall cease to be .
A media-only single , Stuck Inside a Cloud , which Leng described as a uniquely candid reaction to illness and mortality , achieved number 27 on Billboards Adult Contemporary chart .
The single Any Road , released in May 2003 , reached number 37 on the UK Singles Chart .
Marwa Blues went on to receive the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance , while Any Road was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance .
Harrison wrote his first song , Dont Bother Me , while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963 , as an exercise to see if I could write a song , as he remembered .
Dont Bother Me appeared on the bands second album , With the Beatles , later that year , then on Meet the Beatles !
in the US in early 1964 .
In 1965 , he contributed I Need You and You Like Me Too Much to the album Help !

Harrisons songwriting ability improved through the years , but his material did not earn full respect from his fellow Beatles until near the groups break-up .
In 1969 , McCartney told Lennon : Until this year , our songs have been better than Georges .
Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours .
Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs .
Most Beatles albums contain at least two Harrison compositions , and there are three of his songs on the 1966 Revolver LP , the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter , wrote Inglis .
Of the 1967 Harrison song Within You Without You , author Gerry Farrell claimed that Harrison had created a new form , calling the composition : a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music .
Lennon called the song one of Harrisons best : His mind and his music are clear .
There is his innate talent , he brought that sound together .
Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described Something as a masterpiece : an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge Yesterday and Michelle as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced .
According to Kenneth Womack , Harrison comes into his own on Abbey Road ... Here Comes the Sun is matched -- indeed , surpassed -- only by Something , his crowning achievement .
Inglis considered Abbey Road a turning point in Harrisons development as a songwriter and musician .
He described Harrisons contributions to the LP as exquisite , declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs .
During the albums recording , Harrison asserted more creative control than before , proactively rejecting suggestions for changes to his music or lyrics , particularly from McCartney .
His interest in Indian music proved a strong influence on his songwriting and contributed to his innovation within the Beatles .
According to Rolling Stone , Harrisons openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions .
His use of dissonance on ... Taxman and I Want to Tell You was revolutionary in popular music - and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen , Luciano Berio , Edgard Varese and Igor Stravinsky .
In 1997 , author Gerry Farrell commented : It is a mark of Harrisons sincere involvement ... that , nearly thirty years on , the Beatles Indian songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion .
Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner described Harrison as a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate , eloquent melodic sense .
He played exquisitely in the service of the song .
Harrisons friend and former bandmate Tom Petty agreed : He just had a way of getting right to the business , of finding the right thing to play .
The guitar picking style of Chet Atkins and Carl Perkins influenced Harrison , giving a country music feel to many of the Beatles recordings .
He identified Chuck Berry as an early influence and Ry Cooder as an important later influence .
In 1961 the Beatles recorded Cry for a Shadow , a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by Lennon and Harrison , who is credited with composing the songs lead guitar part , building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as the Shadows .
The musicologist Walter Everett noted that while early Beatles compositions typically held close to the conventional patterns in rock music at the time , he also identified significant variations in their rhythm and tonal direction .
Harrisons liberal use of the diatonic scale in his guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly , and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly feel in the style of Perkins .
Within this framework he often utilized syncopation , as during his guitar solos for the Beatles covers of Berrys Roll Over Beethoven and Too Much Monkey Business .
Another of Harrisons musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves , as on Ill Be on My Way .
He was the first person to own a Rickenbacker 360/12 , a guitar that featured twelve strings in 6 pairs , the low eight of which are tuned in pairs , one octave apart ; the higher 4 being pairs tuned in unison .
The Rickenbacker is also unique among twelve strings in having the lower octave string of each of the first four pairs placed above the higher tuned string .
This , and the naturally rich harmonics produced by a twelve string guitar providing the distinctive overtones found on many of the Beatles recordings .
His use of this guitar during the recording of A Hard Days Night helped to popularize the model , and the jangly sound became so prominent that Melody Maker termed it the Beatles secret weapon .
Harrison wrote the chord progression of his first published song , Dont Bother Me , almost exclusively in the Dorian mode , demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in his embrace of Indian music .
The dark timbre of his guitar playing on the track was accentuated by his use of uncomplicated yet effective C +9 chord voicings and a solo in the minor pentatonic scale .
By 1964 he had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist , writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones , as with the ending chord arpeggios on A Hard Days Night .
In 1965 he used an expression pedal to control his guitars volume on I Need You , creating a syncopated flautando effect with the melody resolving its dissonance through tonal displacements .
He used the same volume-swell technique on Yes It Is , applying what Everett described as ghostly articulation to the songs natural harmonics .
Of Rubber Souls If I Needed Someone , Harrison said : its like a million other songs written around the D chord .
If you move your fingers about , you get various little melodies ... it amazes me that people still find new permutations of the same notes .
His other contribution to the album , Think for Yourself , features what Everett described as ambiguous tonal coloring , utilizing chromaticism in G major with a strange mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic ; he called it a tour de force of altered scale degrees .
In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver .
He played backwards guitar on Lennons composition Im Only Sleeping and a guitar counter-melody on And Your Bird Can Sing that moved in parallel octaves above McCartneys bass downbeats .
His guitar playing on I Want to Tell You exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for Sgt Peppers Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds mirrors Lennons vocal line in much the same way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song .
Everett described Harrisons guitar solo from Old Brown Shoe as stinging highly Claptonesque .
He identified two of the compositions significant motifs : a bluesy trichord and a diminished triad with roots in A and E. Huntley called the song a sizzling rocker with a ferocious ... solo .
In Greenes opinion , Harrisons demo for the song contains one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song .
Harrisons playing on Abbey Road , and in particular on Something , marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist .
The songs guitar solo shows a varied range of influences , incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian gamakas .
According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack : Something meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrisons guitar solos ... A masterpiece in simplicity , reaches toward the sublime .
Harrison received an Ivor Novello award in July 1970 for Something , as The Best Song Musically and Lyrically of the Year .
After Delaney Bramlett inspired him to learn slide guitar , Harrison began to incorporate it into his solo work , which allowed him to mimic many traditional Indian instruments , including the sarangi and the dilruba .
Leng described Harrisons slide guitar solo on Lennons How Do You Sleep ?
as a departure for the sweet soloist of Something , calling his playing rightly famed ... one of Harrisons greatest guitar statements .
Lennon commented : Thats the best hes ever fucking played in his life .
A Hawaiian influence is notable in much of Harrisons music , ranging from his slide guitar work on Gone Troppo to his televised performance of the Cab Calloway standard Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea on ukulele in 1992 .
Lavezzoli described Harrisons slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental Marwa Blues as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian sarod or veena , calling it yet another demonstration of Harrisons unique slide approach .
Harrison was an admirer of George Formby and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain , and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of Free as a Bird .
He performed at a Formby convention in 1991 , and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society .
Harrison played bass guitar on numerous tracks , including the Beatles songs Drive My Car , She Said She Said , Golden Slumbers , Birthday and Honey Pie .
He also played bass on several solo recordings , including Faster , Wake Up My Love and Bye Bye Love .
When Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958 his main guitar was a Hofner President Acoustic , which he soon traded for a Hofner Club 40 model .
His first solid-body electric guitar was a Czech-built Jolana Futurama/Grazioso .
The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models , played through a Vox amplifier , including a Gretsch Duo Jet that he bought secondhand in 1961 , and posed with on the album cover for Cloud Nine .
He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman , which he played on She Loves You , and during the Beatles 1964 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show .
In 1963 he bought a Rickenbacker 425 Fireglo , and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar , which was the second of its kind to be manufactured .
Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and used it in recording Rubber Soul , notably on the song Nowhere Man .
In early 1966 Harrison , Lennon , and McCartney each purchased Epiphone Casinos , which they used on Revolver .
Harrison also used a Gibson J-160E and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album .
He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word Bebopalula above the pickguard and the guitars nickname , Rocky , on the headstock .
He played this guitar in the Magical Mystery Tour film and throughout his solo career .
In mid-1968 he acquired a Gibson Les Paul that he nicknamed Lucy .
Around this time , he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J-200 , which he used for early demos of While My Guitar Gently Weeps .
In late 1968 Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custom-made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype , made especially for him by a Fender master builder who also crafted a prototype Stratocaster for Jimi Hendrix .
Harrisons music projects during the final years of the Beatles included producing Apple Records artists Doris Troy , Jackie Lomax and Billy Preston .
Throughout his solo career , he benefited from the inclusion of guest musicians on his albums , and he made efforts to reciprocate the favours by participating in their recordings .
He was featured as a guitarist on tracks by Dave Mason , Nicky Hopkins , Alvin Lee , Ronnie Wood , Billy Preston and Tom Scott .
Harrison co-wrote songs and music with Dylan , Clapton , Preston , Doris Troy , David Bromberg , Gary Wright , Wood , Jeff Lynne , and Tom Petty , among others .
Harrison co-wrote the song Badge with Clapton , which was included on Cream s 1969 album , Goodbye .
Harrison played rhythm guitar on the track , using the pseudonym LAngelo Misterioso for contractual reasons .
He used the same pseudonym when he recorded a guitar part for Never Tell Your Mother Shes Out of Tune , a song from Jack Bruce s 1969 solo album , Songs for a Tailor .
In May 1970 he played guitar on several songs during a recording session for Dylans album New Morning .
In addition to his own work , between 1971 and 1973 he co-wrote and/or produced three top ten hits for Starr : It Dont Come Easy , Back Off Boogaloo and Photograph .
In 1971 he played electric slide guitar on How Do You Sleep ?
and a dobro on Crippled Inside , both from Lennons Imagine album .
Also that year , he produced and played slide guitar on Badfingers top ten hit Day After Day , and a dobro on Prestons I Wrote a Simple Song .
He worked with Harry Nilsson on Youre Breakin My Heart and with Cheech & Chong on Basketball Jones .
In 1973 he produced and made a guest appearance on the album Shankar Family & Friends .
In 1974 Harrison founded Dark Horse Records .
In addition to eventually releasing his own albums on the label , he initially used the company as an avenue for collaboration with other musicians .
He wanted Dark Horse to serve as a creative outlet for artists , as Apple Records had for the Beatles .
Harrison explained : Most of the stuff will be what I produce .
Eric Idle commented : Hes extremely generous , and he backs and supports all sorts of people that youll never , ever hear of .
The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and Splinter , whose album Harrison produced , which provided Dark Horse with their first hit , Costafine Town .
Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes , Henry McCullough , Jiva , and Stairsteps .
Harrison collaborated with Tom Scott on Scotts album New York Connection , and in 1981 he played guitar on Walk a Thin Line , from Mick Fleetwood s The Visitor .
In 1996 he recorded Distance Makes No Difference With Love with Carl Perkins , and played slide guitar on the title track of Dylans Under the Red Sky album .
In 2001 he performed as a guest musician on Jeff Lynne and Electric Light Orchestras comeback album Zoom , and on the song Love Letters for Bill Wymans Rhythm Kings .
He also co-wrote a new song with his son Dhani , Horse to the Water , which was recorded on 1 October , eight weeks before his death .
It appeared on Jools Holland s album Small World , Big Band .
During the Beatles American tour in August 1965 , Harrisons friend David Crosby of the Byrds introduced him to Indian classical music and the work of sitar maestro Ravi Shankar .
Harrison described Shankar as the first person who ever impressed me in my life ... and he was the only person who didnt try to impress me .
Harrison became fascinated with the sitar and immersed himself in Indian music .
According to Lavezzoli , Harrisons introduction of the instrument on the Beatles song Norwegian Wood opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music , triggering what Shankar would call The Great Sitar Explosion of 1966-67 .
Lavezzoli described Harrison as the man most responsible for this phenomenon .
In June 1966 Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle , asked to be his student , and was accepted .
On 6 July , Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from Rikhi Ram & Sons in New Delhi .
Lavezzoli described Harrisons sitar playing on the Revolver track Love You To as an astonishing improvement over Norwegian Wood and the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician .
In September , he returned to India to study sitar with Shankar .
He initially stayed in Bombay , then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake where Shankar taught him for six weeks .
After Shankar , he received tutelage from Shambhu Das .
Harrison studied the instrument until 1968 , when an encounter with Clapton and Hendrix at a hotel in New York convinced him to put down the instrument and return to guitar playing .
He commented : I decided ... I should get back to the guitar because Im not getting any better at it , and Im not going to be a great sitar player ... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier .
By the mid-1960s Harrison had become an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism , introducing it to the other Beatles .
During the filming of Help !
in the Bahamas , they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga , Swami Vishnu-devananda , who gave each of them a signed copy of his book , The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga .
Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions , he made a pilgrimage to Bombay with his wife Pattie , where he studied sitar , met several gurus , and visited various holy places .
In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi .
Harrisons use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism .
He commented : For me , it was like a flash .
The first time I had acid , it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me , and I realized a lot of things .
I didnt learn them because I already knew them , but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them .
From the moment I had that , I wanted to have it all the time -- these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas , and Ravis music .
Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s , and a devotee of the Indian mystic Paramahansa Yogananda .
In mid-1969 , he produced the single Hare Krishna Mantra , performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple .
Soon after , Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition , particularly japa-yoga chanting with beads , and became a lifelong devotee .
He respected people of other faiths and once remarked : All religions are branches of one big tree .
It doesnt matter what you call Him just as long as you call .
He commented on his beliefs : .
Before his religious conversion , the only British performer known for similar activities had been Cliff Richard , whose conversion to Christianity in 1966 had gone largely unnoticed by the public .
By contrast , wrote Inglis , Harrisons spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular musics increasing maturity ... what he , and the Beatles had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs .
Harrison married the model Pattie Boyd on 21 January 1966 , with McCartney as best man .
Harrison and Boyd had met in 1964 during the production of the film A Hard Days Night , in which the 19-year-old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl .
They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalized in 1977 .
Boyd said her decision to end their marriage and leave Harrison was due largely to his repeated infidelities , culminating in an affair with Starrs wife Maureen , which Boyd called the final straw .
She characterized the last year of their marriage as fuelled by alcohol and cocaine , and she stated : George used coke excessively , and I think it changed him ... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart .
She subsequently moved in with Clapton , and they married in 1979 .
Harrison married Dark Horse Records secretary Olivia Trinidad Arias on 2 September 1978 .
They had met at the Dark Horse offices in Los Angeles in 1974 , and together had one son , Dhani Harrison , born on 1 August 1978 .
He restored the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park , his home in Henley-on-Thames , where several of his music videos were filmed including Crackerbox Palace ; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of All Things Must Pass .
He employed ten workers to maintain the garden .
Harrison commented on gardening as a form of escapism : Sometimes I feel like Im actually on the wrong planet , and its great when Im in my garden , but the minute I go out the gate I think : What the hell am I doing here ?
His autobiography , I , Me , Mine , is dedicated to gardeners everywhere .
The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book , which said little about the Beatles , focusing instead on Harrisons hobbies , music and lyrics .
Taylor commented : George is not disowning the Beatles ... but it was a long time ago and actually a short part of his life .
Harrison had an interest in sports cars and motor racing ; he was one of the 100 people who purchased the McLaren F1 road car .
He had collected photos of racing drivers and their cars since he was young ; at 12 he had attended his first race , the 1955 British Grand Prix at Aintree .
He wrote Faster as a tribute to the Formula One racing drivers Jackie Stewart and Ronnie Peterson .
Proceeds from its release went to the Gunnar Nilsson cancer charity , set up after the Swedish drivers death from the disease in 1978 .
Harrisons first extravagant car , a 1964 Aston Martin DB5 , was sold at auction on 7 December 2011 in London .
An anonymous Beatles collector paid PS350 ,000 for the vehicle that Harrison had bought new in January 1965 .
For most of the Beatles career the relationships in the group were close .
According to Hunter Davies , the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life , but communally living the same life .
They were each others greatest friends .
Harrisons ex-wife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles all belonged to each other and admitted , George has a lot with the others that I can never know about .
Nobody , not even the wives , can break through or even comprehend it .
Starr said , We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together .
In the old days wed have the biggest hotel suites , the whole floor of the hotel , and the four of us would end up in the bathroom , just to be with each other .
He added , there were some really loving , caring moments between four people : a hotel room here and there - a really amazing closeness .
Just four guys who loved each other .
It was pretty sensational .
Lennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was one of young follower and older guy ... was like a disciple of mine when we started .
The two later bonded over their LSD experiences , finding common ground as seekers of spirituality .
They took radically different paths thereafter , Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives .
In 1974 Harrison said of his former bandmate : John Lennon is a saint and hes heavy-duty , and hes great and I love him .
But at the same time , hes such a bastard - but thats the great thing about him , you see ?

Harrison and McCartney were the first of the Beatles to meet , having shared a school bus , and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together .
McCartney stated that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring .
McCartney was best man at Harrisons wedding in 1966 , and was the only Beatle in attendance .
McCartney has referred to Harrison as his baby brother .
In a 1974 BBC radio interview with Alan Freeman , Harrison stated : ruined me as a guitar player .
Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartneys personal relationship , as both men admitted that they often got on each others nerves .
Rodriguez commented : even to the end of Georges days , theirs was a volatile relationship .
Harrison was involved in humanitarian and political activism throughout his life .
In the 1960s , the Beatles supported the civil rights movement and protested against the Vietnam War .
After the bands break-up , Ravi Shankar consulted Harrison about how to provide aid to the people of Bangladesh after the 1970 Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation War .
Harrison recorded the song Bangla Desh , and pushed Apple Records to release his song alongside Shankars Joy Bangla in an effort to raise funds .
Shankar then asked for Harrisons advice about planning a small charity event in the US .
Harrison responded by organizing the Concert for Bangladesh , which raised more than $ 240,000 .
In June 1972 , UNICEF honoured Harrison and Shankar with the Child Is the Father of Man award at an annual ceremony in recognition of their fundraising efforts for Bangladesh .
The George Harrison Humanitarian Fund for UNICEF , a joint effort between the Harrison family and the US Fund for UNICEF , aims to support programmes that help children caught in humanitarian emergencies .
In December 2007 , they donated $ 450,000 to help the victims of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh .
On 13 October 2009 , the first George Harrison Humanitarian Award went to Ravi Shankar for his efforts in saving the lives of children , and his involvement with the Concert for Bangladesh .
In 1973 Peter Sellers introduced Harrison to Denis OBrien .
Soon after , the two went into business together .
In 1978 , in an effort to produce Monty Pythons Life of Brian , they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films .
Harrison explained : The name of the company came about as a bit of a joke .
Id been to Wooky Hole in Somerset ... an old paper mill where they show you how to make old underpants into paper .
So I bought a few rolls , and they had this watermark British Handmade Paper ... So we said ... well call it Handmade Films .
Their opportunity for investment came after EMI Films withdrew funding at the demand of their Chief Executive , Bernard Delfont .
Harrison financed the production of Life of Brian in part by mortgaging his home , which Idle later called the most anybodys ever paid for a cinema ticket in history .
The film grossed $ 21 million at the box office in the US .
The first film distributed by HandMade Films was The Long Good Friday , and the first they produced was Time Bandits , a co-scripted project by Monty Pythons Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin .
The film featured a new song by Harrison , Dream Away , in the closing credits .
Time Bandits became one of HandMades most successful and acclaimed efforts ; with a budget of $ 5 million , it earned $ 35 million in the US within ten weeks of its release .
Harrison served as executive producer for 23 films with HandMade , including Mona Lisa , Shanghai Surprise and Withnail and I .
He made several cameo appearances in these films , including a role as a nightclub singer in Shanghai Surprise , for which he recorded five new songs .
According to author and musicologist Ian Inglis , Harrisons executive role in HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis , producing some of the countrys most memorable movies of the 1980s .
A series of box office bombs in the late 1980s caused HandMade to cease operations in 1991 ; three years later , the company was sold .
In 1965 Harrison and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire .
They received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October .
In 1971 the Beatles received an Academy Award for the best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be .
The minor planet 4149 Harrison , discovered in 1984 , was named after him .
In December 1992 he became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award , an honour presented to music artists for significant bodies of work .
Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time .
In 2002 , on the first anniversary of his death , the Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall .
Clapton organized the event , which included performances by many of Harrisons friends and musical collaborators , including McCartney and Starr .

The samavadi is the second-most prominent note of a raga in Indian classical music .
The primary note of the raga is the vadi ; the vadi and samvadi are in most cases a fourth or fifth apart .
A samvadi is a note of special significance .
A performer will typically try to emphasize the samvadi along with the vadi when improvising on a certain raga .
The vadi and samvadi can be crucial in defining the raga at hand , and in some cases two ragas with the same arohana and avrohana can be distinguished only by the prominence of their sonant and consonant notes

Allauddin Khan was a Bengali sarodiya and multi-instrumentalist , composer and one of the most renowned music teachers of the 20th century in Indian classical music .
In 1935 , he toured Europe , along with Uday Shankar s ballet troupe , and later also worked at his institute , Uday Shankar India Culture Centre at Almora for a while .
During his lifetime , he composed several ragas and laid the foundation of a modern Maihar gharana .
Amongst his recordings which are rare , the most important ones are those he recorded with the All India Radio in 1959-60 .
He was the father of sarod maestro Ali Akbar Khan and Annapurna Devi , and the uncle of Raja Hossain Khan , as well as the guru of Ravi Shankar , Nikhil Banerjee , Vasant Rai , Pannalal Ghosh , Bahadur Khan , Sharan Rani , Jyotin Bhattacharya and other influential musicians .
He himself was a disciple of many great musicians , including Gopal Chandra Banerjee , Lobo , Munne Khan , and most importantly after a lot of struggle managed to become a shagird of the legendary Veena player , Wazir Khan of Rampur .
He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan , Indias second highest civilian honour in 1971 , and prior to that in 1954 , the Sangeet Natak Akademi awarded him with its highest honour , the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship for lifetime contribution to Indian music .
Allauddin Khan was born in Shibpur village in Brahmanbaria District , the son of Sabdar Hossain Khan , also known as Sadhu Khan .
Allauddins elder brother , Fakir Aftabuddin , first taught him the basics of music at home .
At the age of ten , Allauddin ran away from home to join a jatra band , a traditional Bengali form of theater .
This experience exposed him to the rich folk tradition of Bengal .
After some time , he went to Kolkata , and was accepted as a student by singer Gopal Krishna Bhattacharya , alias Nulo Gopal .
Allauddin committed to a 12-year practice program ; However , Nulo Gopal died of plague after the seventh year .
Khan then became a disciple of Amritalal Dutt , a close relative of Swami Vivekananda and music director at Kolkatas Star Theatre , with the goal of becoming an instrumentalist .
At this time , he also took lessons in European classical violin from Lobo , a bandmaster from Goa .
Khan got interested in sarod after a concert at Jagat Kishore Acharyas , zamindar of Muktagachha , where he listened to Ahmed Ali Khan , a student of Asghar Ali Khan .
Alauddin became his student , and studied the sarod under him for five years .
His next step was to go to Rampur for lessons from Wazir Khan Beenkar , court musician of the Nawab there , and one of the last direct descendants of the legendary Tansen .
Through him , Alauddin was given access to the Senia gharana .
He later became the court musician of Brijnath Singh Maharaja of Maihar Estate in Central Province .
During his time as a court musician , Khan completely reshaped the Maihar gharana of Indian classical music .
The Maihar gharana was established in the 19th Century , but Khans contribution was so fundamental that he is often thought to be its creator .
This was a period of rapid change for Hindustani instrumental music , thanks not least to Khan , who infused the beenbaj and dhrupad ang , previously known from the been , surbahar and sur-sringar , into the playing of many classical instruments .
For though he gave concerts on the sarod , Allauddin played many instruments , something that shaped his pedagogy .
He put together an orchestra with Indian instruments , the String Band now known as Maihar Band , and while his son , Ali Akbar Khan , was taught the sarod , his daughter Annapurna Devi learned the surbahar , students such as Ravi Shankar and Nikhil Banerjee played the Sitar , Jyotin Bhattacharya played the sarod , Rabin Ghosh played on violin and Baijnath Singh and Pannalal Ghosh the bansuri bamboo flute .
Baijnath Singh was first and Vasant Rai was Allauddin Khans last student .
Of course Ravi and Ali Akbar Khan were to be very famous and spread this gharana over the world - something that Allauddin himself had started when , in 1935-1936 , he went on an international tour with Uday Shankar s dance troupe .
Allauddin stayed at Maihar from 1918 to his death .
In 1955 , he established a Maihar College of Music .
He was given the Sangeet Natak Academy Award in 1952 , and the Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan - Indias third and second highest civilian decorations - in 1958 and 1971 , respectively .
Anecdotes about Khan range from throwing a Tabla tuning hammer at the Maharaja himself to taking care of disabled beggars .
A few years before the turn of the century , he married Madanmanjari Devi .
He had one son and sarod heir , Ali Akbar Khan , and three daughters , Sharija , Jehanara and Annapurna who grew up as Roshanara Khan .
Sharija died an early death suffering from diseases in her childhood and when Jahanara got married and a jealous mother-in-law burnt her Tanpura , a shocked Alauddin Khan decided not to train his only remaining daughter .
One day , however , he came home to discover Annapurna teaching her brother Ali Akbar Khan , and her talent made the emotional father change his mind .
Annapurna learned classical vocal music , Sitar , and Surbahar from her father .
She later married and divorced Ravi Shankar .
Khan was fond of sankeerna ragas , and created many ragas of his own , including Arjun , Bhagabati , Bhim , Bhuvaneshvari , Chandika , Dhabalashri , Dhankosh , Dipika , Durgeshvari , Gandhi , Gandhi Bilawal , Haimanti , Hem-Behag , Hemant , Hemant Bhairav , Imni Manjh , Jaunpuri Todi , Kedar Manjh , Komal Bhimpalasi , Komal Marwa , Madanmanjari , Madhabsri , Madhavgiri , Malaya , Manjh Khamaj , Meghbahar , Muhammed , Nat-Khamaj , Prabhakali , Raj Bijoy , Rajeshri , Shobhavati , Subhabati , Sugandha and Surasati .
Many of these have not become common Maihar repertoire ; Manjh Khamaj is perhaps the best known .
Some of Allauddins recordings have been released on CD , on the Great Garanas : Maihar compilation in RPG / EMI s Chairmans Choice series

Adana is an Indian raga .
It is also called Adana kanada .
It is often sang or played in drut laya after a vilambit composition in raga Darbari Kanada , as Adana is straighter than Darbari in its chalan , thus allowing faster passages .
The flow of this raga is similar to a mix of Madhyamad Saranga with Darbari .
Another common vivadi some artists use sparingly is shuddha ni which enhances the Saranga mood of the raga .
Flat Ga is usually omitted in ascent and in descent always appears in the distinctive Kanada phrase g M R S. Flat Dha is present in descent , but one should never linger on it .
In fact it is omitted by some musicians completely .
Most movements are in the upper tetrachord , around high Sa .
It is very common to begin the elaboration of this raga with high Sa .
Adana was a major raga in the 17th century and a combination of the then current ragas Malhar and Kanada .
In a ragamala from Mewar it is depicted as an ascetic man sitting on a tiger skin , however , Somanatha describes him as Kama the god of love .
His Adana was quite different from the raga as it is performed today

Baiju Bawra or Baijnath Prasad or Baijnath Mishra was an Indian dhrupad singer .
He was the court musician of Raja Mansingh Tomar of Gwalher , now Gwalior , along with Nayak Charju , Bakshu , Tansen and others .
Much of the information on Baiju Bawra is legendary and not historically verifiable .
Bawra was born in Chanderi on Sharad Purnima in the month of Ashwini in 1599 according to Vikram Samvat calendar .
He was called Bawra because he was insanely in love with Kalavati dancer in Chanderi .
Baiju learnt Dhrupad music by Guru HariDas Goswami in Vrindavan .
Bawra was a musician at the court of the Raja of Chanderi .
Later , he became a musician at the court of Raja Mansingh of Gwalher .
Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat had also patronized Baiju .
Like Tansen , the musician at the court of Mughal Emperor Akbar , Bawra was a disciple of Swami Haridas .
According to historical books preserved in Jai Vilas Mahal in Gwalior , he would light oil lamps by singing Raga Deepak , make it rain by singing the ragas Megh , Megh Malhar , or Gaud Malhar , and bloom flowers by singing raga Bahar as well as melting of stone by singing raga malkauns .
Besides Tansen , renowned singers , Baba Ram Das , who composed raga Ramdasi Malhar , and Nayak Charju , who composed raga Charju ki Malhar , were Baijus contemporaries .
Historian Abul Fazal at Emperor Akbar s court and historian Faqirullah at Emperor Aurangzeb s court have written that Baiju defeated Tansen in a singing competition at the court of Akbar .
Tansen then touched Baijus feet and asked for his own life .
In response , kind-hearted Baiju went back to Gwalior .
Baiju died of typhoid at the age of 71 on the eve of the Indian festival , Basant Panchami in Vikram Samvat 1670 in chanderi .
Baiju Bawra , a Hindi - language film was made on him in 1952 .
In the movie , Baiju is a musician who believes that Tansen is responsible for his fathers death .
He attempts to avenge his fathers death by challenging Tansen to a musical duel and is successful in defeating him .
This films story is completely different from Baijus real life , but still became a huge commercial success , especially due to the songs like O Duniya Ke Rakhwale sung by the legendary singer Mohammed Rafi
Geet Ramayan is a collection of 56 Marathi language songs chronologically describing events from the Indian Hindu epic , the Ramayana .
It was broadcast by All India Radio , Pune in 1955-1956 , four years before television was introduced in India .
Written by G. D. Madgulkar and the songs being composed by Sudhir Phadke , Geet Ramayan was acclaimed for its lyrics , music and singing .
It is considered a milestone of Marathi light music and the most popular Marathi version of Ramayana .
The team of Madgulkar and Phadke presented a new song every week for a year with every song being aired first on a Friday morning and then again on Saturday and Sunday morning , between 8:45 AM and 9:00 AM IST .
The programs first song Kusa Lava Ramayan Gati was aired on 1 April 1955 .
Though Geet Ramayan is based on sage Valmiki s epic Ramayana , Madgulkar chose a different narrative format and was praised for the lyrics , and was called Adhunik Valmiki .
The Geet Ramayan is considered as the crescendo of Madgulkars literary vigour .
Phadke mainly used ragas of Hindustani classical music to compose the songs .
He also selected the raga and the Tala of a song to suit the time of the incident and the narrative mood .
The poet and composer were praised for their contribution to the series .
The series showcased a total of 32 various characters from Ramayana .
Rama being the lead character of the series was given maximum number of songs , followed by eight songs for Sita .
Madgulkar expressed their various moods , ranging from their divinity to the human weaknesses .
Incidentally , the central antagonist of the Ramayana and Geet Ramayan , the demon-king Ravana , was not given any song .
The series is narrated by Kusha and Lava , twin sons of Rama and Sita , and the writer of Ramayana was also given one song in the series .
With increasing popularity since its release , Geet Ramayan has been translated into nine other languages : five Hindi translations and one each in Bengali , English , Gujarati , Kannada , Konkani , Sanskrit , Sindhi and Telugu .
It has also been transliterated into Braille .
Geet Ramayan was conceptualized in 1955 , four years before the introduction of television in India in 1959 .
During the early days of All India Radio , Pune , station director Sitakant Lad wanted to begin a radio programme which would be entertaining and provide moral education .
He hence outlined his plan to poet and writer G. D. Madgulkar .
Since the Ramayana is an Indian epic , Lad and Madgulkar came up with an idea of a version in singable verse .
Madgulkar accepted the challenge , enlisting his music-director friend Sudhir Phadke for the collaboration .
The team of Madgulkar and Phadke would present a new song every week for a year .
Every song would be aired first on a Friday morning and then again on Saturday and Sunday morning , between 8:45 am and 9:00 am IST .
The programme was initially planned for a year , but 1955 in the Hindu calendar had an extra month ; therefore , four songs were added to extend the series to a total of fifty-six .
Apart from the number of songs , Madgulkar and Phadke left music , lyrics and choice of singers ad libitum .
Madgulkar was given artistic liberty for the choice of the meters for the song , execution of the story line , and the message he could convey through it .
Initially , the programme was scheduled to begin on the occasion of Gudi Padwa , beginning of the New year according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar but later finalized to be Rama Navami , traditional birthday of Rama .
The programs first song Kusa Lava Ramayan Gati was aired on 1 April 1955 at 8:45 am IST .
Vidya Madgulkar , the poets wife , recalled in an interview that Madgulkar wrote the first song and gave it to Phadke the day before the recording ; however , Phadke lost the lyrics .
With the broadcast already scheduled , station director Sitakant Lad requested Madgulkar to re-write the song which was readily declined by an angered poet .
Lad then decided to lock the poet in one of recording rooms equipped with all the required writing material and agreed to unlock the door only when Madgulkar is ready with the lyrics .
Madgulkar then rewrote the lyrics from memory in fifteen minutes so Phadke could compose the music .
Though Valmiki was the main inspiration for the Geet Ramayan , Madgulkar chose a different narrative format .
He used a simple lyrical format with a flexible number of stanzas .
The metre used was similar to Bhavageete , with roughly the same number of matras in each line .
The metre was also suited to the narration and the characters who sang the song .
Madgulkar used various formats , including narrative , descriptive and communal songs .
He was praised for his lyrics , and was called Adhunik Valmiki ; and the Geet Ramayan is considered the crescendo of Madgulkars literary vigour .
Madgulkars narrative format was different than that of Valmikis where he did not end the series with the coronation of Rama and Sita , but included Sitas abandonment by Rama , and her giving birth to the twins , Lava and Kusha .
However , he chose not to include the last episode of Sitas final confrontation in Ramas court and her entering the earth .
Madgulkar ended the series with the song Ga Balano , Shriramayan which was voiced by Valmiki where he tells his disciples , Lava and Kusha , how they should recite the Ramayana in front of Rama .
Evidently , this also completes the cycle of songs where it had begun , with Lava and Kusha singing in Ramas court .
Madgulkar did not make any attempt to provide new interpretation or meaning to the Ramayana but told the same story in the simpler and poetic format .
With inclusion of characters like Ahalya and Shabari , he included the sentiments of religious devotion and also gave divine touch to the story while describing the marriage of Sita and Rama as a union of Maya and Brahman .
He composed songs on all seven chapters or Kanda of Ramayana .
Out of 56 songs , poet composed twelve songs on Balakanda , seven on Ayodhya Kanda , fourteen on Aranya Kanda , three on Kishkindha Kanda , four on Sundara Kanda , twelve on Yuddha Kanda and three on Uttara Kanda .
As the series became popular , the daily newspapers in Pune began to print the text of the new song every week after its first airing .
The first official edition of the text of these fifty-six poems and their prose narrations came out on the occasion of Vijayadashami , October 3 , 1957 , published for Akashwani by the director of the Publications Division , Delhi , in pocketbook size .
Musical director Sudhir Phadke composed the songs based on the ragas of Hindustani classical music , including Bhopali , Bhimpalasi and Madhuvanti .
The raga and Tala of a song was selected to suit the time of the incident and the narrative mood .
For example , the song Cala Raghava Cala is composed as a Bibhas raga , and the song describes an event taking place in the morning .
The songs Aj Mi Sapmucta Jahale and Yacka , Thambu Nako Darata are not based on a specific raga , but include several ragas in each song .
The singers , which included Vasantrao Deshpande , Manik Varma , Suresh Haldankar , Ram Phatak and Lata Mangeshkar , were familiar with the vocal style of Indian classical music .
Phadke voiced all the songs for Rama , and well-known Kirana gharana singer Manik Varma voiced the character of Sita .
Lata Mangeshkar sang one song for Sita , Maj Sang Laksmana , in which Sita questions Rama about her abandonment but her question remains unanswered .
A total of 32 characters from the Ramayana were voiced in the Geet Ramayan .
Madgulkar expressed the emotions of characters such as Rama , Sita , Hanuman - the monkey god and devotee of Rama - and Lakshmana ; he also attempted to give voice to the humblest characters in the epic .
The vanara are given a song describing a bridge forming over the ocean so Rama and his army could cross to Lanka .
The poet noted that the song described the sacrifice of joint labour and was an example of the principle , Union is strength .
Nishadraj Guha and the boatmen who helped Rama in crossing the Ganges river expressed themselves in Nakos Nauke Parat Phiru .
The author of the Ramayana , Valmiki , was also given a song with his advice to Ramas sons Kusha and Lava before they appear before Rama .
Being hero of the Ramayana and Geet Ramayan , Madgulkar expressed the varied moods of Rama ; he was the most-voiced character in the Geet Ramayan with ten songs , followed by Sita with eight .
He portrayed Rama as a complex character full of emotions and passions , with some of the questionable deeds , yet bound by a traditional virtue and the sanctity of a promise .
Madgulkar voiced Ramas personal ethical dilemmas along with his courage , and steadfastness .
He was shown to be patient with his brothers and mothers , obedient of father and sages , heroic on the battlefield , and diplomatic when dealing with the monkey king , Vali .
Madgulkar is said to have successfully shown Ramas divinity alongside his human weaknesses .
He was shown to be distracted at the loss Sita , and wailed in Lakshmanas presence .
In another situation , he uttered some heart-wrenching words to Sita , in front of his army with blaming her for all the happenings , and then he was also shown to explain his behavior with oaths and confessions of loyalty to Sita .
Ramas mother , Kausalya , sang three songs ; his brother Bharata , his father Dasharatha , Hanuman , Lakshmana , the demon Surpanakha , Ramas guru-sage Vishvamitra and Kusha-Lava have two songs each .
The central antagonist of the Ramayana , the demon-king Ravana , was not given a song ; his oppressive presence was expressed in prose narration , poetic descriptions and songs sung by the other characters .
After Geet Ramayans original broadcast was over in March of 1956 , requests of re-broadcast were flooding the radio station .
All-India Radio repeated the entire series of fifty-six weekly songs due to popular demand .
After the broadcast , Phadke produced public concerts of selected songs .
The first public performance was held in the Madgulkars bungalow , Panchavati at Wakdewadi , Pune on 28 May 1958 .
In 1979 , a Silver Jubilee celebration of the programme took place at the New English School in Pune for eight nights .
Atal Bihari Vajpayee , the then Minister of External Affairs , attended the show as the guest of honour along with the then Deputy Prime Minister of India Yashwantrao Chavan , Bollywood film director Basu Bhattacharya , actor Dada Kondke , and celebrated classical singers such as Bhimsen Joshi and Kishori Amonkar .
Vajpayee also attended the Golden Jubilee celebration with Sharad Pawar and Bal Thackeray .
National Award-winning art director Nitin Chandrakant Desai designed the stage depicting scenes from the Ramayana .
The event featured all the songs from the original Geet Ramayan now vocalized by Shridhar Phadke , Suresh Wadkar , Upendra Bhat , Padmaja Phenany Joglekar and others .
As the radio programme became popular , daily newspapers in Pune began printing the lyrics of the new songs each week .
The publication department of All India Radio also compiled the lyrics and excerpts from the introductory comments in a book form .
The 179-page volume , then priced at 2 , was launched on 3 October 1957 on the occasion of Vijayadashami .
In 1965 , the HMV released ten LPs featuring the voice of Sudhir Phadke .
In 1968 , the Gramophone Company of India released a 10 - cassette set , again featuring Phadkes voice , and 50,000 records were sold .

He has also written a book , Geet Ramayanache Ramayan , describing the making of the radio programme .
Live shows of Geet Ramayan are still produced on occasion of Rama Navami .

The Art and Practice of Ecstatic Chant , Music for Yoga and Other Joys , Loveland , Dial M for Mantra , and Pranayama , a collaboration with his wife , yoga teacher and bhakti dancer , Nubia Teixeira .
The two had a son , Ezra , which led to Uttal 's inspiration to focus his work towards kids .
Uttal began to lead children 's kirtan events near his home in Northern California and he created an album especially for children entitled Kirtan Kids : The Elephant , the Monkey , and the Little Butter Thief .
In addition to those , Uttal also hosted donation-based events at several yoga studios .
At these particular events , children would sit around in a circle and listen as Uttal told `` colorful stories drawn from Ramayana and other Indian myths . ''
The chants during these events were kid-friendly versions .

Rabin Ghosh , a 20th-century violin virtuoso of ' Seni-Maihar ' Gharana of North Indian Classical Music , India , was a disciple of Baba Ustad Allauddin Khan Saheb .
He was noted for his unique style of playing ` Ati-Vilambit ' with an extensive use of ` Micro-Tone ' to imitate the Indian Singing style .
Rabin Ghosh hailed from a family with a strong musical background .
His father was an .
From a very early age , Rabin Ghosh was influenced by the musical atmosphere , which drove him into playing Esraj , Flute , and Tabla .
He finally focused on Violin , under the guidance of Mr. Mani Majumder , one of the renowned violinists of the contemporary time of Western Classical Music .
After continuous training on Western Classical Music he shifted to North Indian Classical Music under the guidance of Sangeetacharya ' Haripada Chattopadhay , exponent violinist of ` Dagar Gharana ' of North Indian Classical Music .
Rabin Ghosh continued his training more than a decade under the tutelage of Haripada Chattopadhay .
During this time he not only won violin Competitions , also performed in concerts along with All India Radio , Calcutta .
In the year 1955 , Rabin Ghosh got an opportunity to play violin before Baba Allauddin Khan Saheb , the doyen of Hindustani Classical Music .
He played Raga Mian ki Todi before him .
Baba Allauddin Khan Saheb was satisfied to accept him as his disciple .
In the mid of 1955 , Rabin Ghosh left for Maihar .
Life at Maihar for Rabin Ghosh was very dedicated .
Besides receiving training from Baba Allauddin Khan Saheb , he was appointed as a teacher of Maihar Government Music College .
Rabin Ghosh had a very strict and long duration practice session which he maintained till the last day in Maihar .
In his own words I used to light a thick fragrance stick and would continue practice till it burned out totally .
At that time , Rabin Ghoshs practice sessions lasted about 12 hours a day but reached a peak of 14 to 16 hours a day .
During his stay at Maihar over seven and half years , he experimented with different techniques on violin sound production and researched sitting posture which helped with the long duration of practice sessions .
During the years of rigorous training under the tutelage of Baba Alauddin Khan Saheb in Maihar , Rabin Ghosh was inspired to ` Design and Develop Five-String Violin ' .
The need to access and explore the lower octave in expressing the mood of Raga RamDashi Malhar , in 1958 , the young artist Rabin Ghosh , had an extensive experimentation , which augmented 4 string violin to 5 string violin without compromising the original tonal quality of conventional violin .
For Five-String Violin he used to use 1st string ` E ' as ` Rishav ' , 2nd string ` A ' as ` Pancham ' , 3rd string 'D ' as ` Saraj ' , 4th string ` G ' as ` Madhyam ' , and 5th string ` C ' as ` Komol Nishad ' .
From 1960 , Rabin Ghosh used ` Five String Violin ' starting with his performances at Tansen Sangeet Sanmelan , Calcutta .
Rabin Ghosh 's playing style was enriched with the amalgamation of singing as well as tantrakari .
He used to use extensive ` Micro-Tone ' to imitate the Indian Singing style .
Another distinct feature of his playing style was holding the violin .
He used his ` specially made violin case ' for resting his violin .
He realized that playing could be more comfortable if the instrument is held from the both end facilitating to play finest Meend , Gamak and other technical applications .
Other aspect was to avoid the ` Excessive Flexion ' of the vertebral column of the performer , instead of resting violin somewhere of the body .
Maestro Rabin Ghosh composed ` Someswara Tala ' imagining the dancing posture of Nataraj , of 11 Beats , having division of 3 - 2 - 3 - .
Going beyond the periphery of performing and teaching Maestro Rabin Ghosh has put his earnest endeavor to compose a few orchestrations on Indian Classical Music .
During his tenure in Maihar , when he was completely engulfed in receiving training in Indian Classical Music from Baba Alauddin Khan Saheb , the motif kindled within his heart a unique feeling which prompted him to compose some pieces on Indian Classical Ragas completely orchestrated .
The ragas in which he explored himself are Jhila Kafi , Bhupali , Kirwani , Khamaj etc. .
His honest effort to con flux two parallel voices in a composition tuned out to be a grand success .
Abhisarika , Niharika , Sanchari and more such compositions shaped between 1973 and 1992 and were staged by his disciples from time to time .
A compact disc album named ` Niharika ' played by his disciples was released with orchestral works .
From 1970 and 1972 The Gramophone Company of India Limited released Three Long Playing Discs .
The stereo recordings consists solo performance of Raga Pahari Jhinjhoti , Raga Ahir Bhairav by Rabin Ghosh , Raga Gunkali with Himangshu Biswas in Flute , Patdeep .

Chandra and Shyamal Bose .
Maestro Rabin Ghosh published a book ` Swarankan Sanghati ' - integration of notation system , where he described and analyzed the common features as well as comparison and method of translating music between Indian Classical Music Notation System and Western Classical Music Notation System .

Anjanibai Malpekar was a noted Indian classical singer , belonging to the Bhendibazaar gharana of Hindustani classical music .
She was a disciple of Ustad Nazeer Khan of the gharana , with whom she started training at age 8 .
She made her professional debut at age 16 in Mumbai , where she spent the rest of her life .
She had a flourishing music career , till 1920 , when after death of her guru , she moved away from public performances , eventually retiring from public after 1923 .
Thereafter she focussed on training her music disciples , notably Kumar Gandharva and Kishori Amonkar .
In 1958 , she became the first woman to be awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship the highest honour conferred by Sangeet Natak Akademi , Indias National Academy for Music , Dance and Drama .
Malpekar was born on April 22 , 1883 , in Malpe in Goa , in music loving family that belonged to Goan Kalavant community .
Both her grandmother Gujabai and mother Nabubai were respected names in music circles .
At young age of 8 , she started her musical training under the tutelage of Ustad Nazeer Khan of Bhendibazaar gharana .
The gharana had its origins in the much older Moradabad gharana , and was based in the Bhendi Bazaar area of Mumbai .
Malpekar gave her debut performance at a concert in Mumbai in 1899 , at the age of 16 .
In those days , women of respectable families never sang in public , while Malepakar went on to have a flourishing singing career , with both public and royal patronage .
In time , she became the doyenne of the gharana .
Besides her singing , she also got acclaim for her beauty .
When painter M. V. Dhurandhar did an oil painting of her , another painter Raja Ravi Verma was inspired , and went to do a series of paintings with her as muse , including Lady in the Moonlight , Lady Playing Swarbat , Mohini and The Heartbroken , She modeled for him during his stay in Mumbai in 1901 and 1903 .
However this wasnt without its drawback , especially when singing in public concerts meant singing primarily to a male audience , this often led to harassment .
Thus in 1904 , she even developed fear of singing in public , and lost her voice , though she regained it after a year .
Meanwhile she married Seth Wasanji Ved .
After a successful career as a singer , after the death of her Guru Ustad Nazeer Khan in 1920 , she lost interest in concerts .
Finally , after a last performance at Town Hall , Mumbai , she gave up her public singing career in 1923 .
Thus at age 40 , she decided to devote the rest of her years , to teaching music .
In the coming decades , she taught some notable names in Indian classical music , including Kumar Gandharva who was her first disciple , Kishori Amonkar , Pandit T.D. Janorikar , Begum Akhtar and Naina Devi .
By the 1960s , Bhendibazar gharana based in Mumbai , became famous all over India , with number of popular musicians , besides Aman Ali Khan , it had Jhande Khan , Mamman Khan , Shabbir and Amir Khan .
In 1958 , when for her contribution to music , she was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship the highest honour conferred by Sangeet Natak Akademi , Indias National Academy for Music , Dance and Drama , she became the first woman to received the award .
She died on August 7 , 1974 in Bombay , at the age of 91
Ivor Cutler was a Scottish poet , songwriter and humorist .
He became known for his regular performances on BBC radio , and in particular his numerous sessions recorded for John Peel s influential radio programme , and later for Andy Kershaw s programme .
He appeared in The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour film in 1967 and on Neil Innes television programmes .
Cutler also wrote books for children and adults and was a teacher at A. S. Neill s Summerhill School and for 30 years in inner-city schools in London .
He told Andy Kershaw on his radio show that he also gave private poetry lessons to individuals .
In live performances Cutler would often accompany himself on a harmonium .
Phyllis King appears on several of his records , and for a number of years was a part of his concerts .
She usually read small phrases but also read a few short stories .
The two starred in a BBC radio series , King Cutler , in which they performed their material jointly and singly .
Cutler also collaborated with pianist Neil Ardley and singer Robert Wyatt .
Cutler was a noted eccentric , dressing in a distinctive style including plus-fours and hats adorned with many badges , travelling mainly by bicycle and often communicating by means of sticky labels printed with Cutlerisms , one of which , never knowingly understood came to be applied by supporters and detractors alike .
Others included Kindly disregard , reserved for official correspondence , and to remove this label take it off .
The hallmarks of Cutlers work are surreal , bizarre juxtapositions and close attention to small details of existence , all described in seemingly naive language .
In performance his delivery was frail , halting and minimally inflected .
His writing sometimes edged into whimsy or the macabre .
Many of his poems and songs are in the form of conversations delivered as a monologue .
In these , one party is often Cutler as a child , a poetic voice which he adopted in order to bypass the intellect .
Cutler describes the poverty of his early life and the neglect he experienced from his parents with great stoicism .
He expresses acceptance of his lot and gratitude for the basic elements of life , for nature , and for parental love , even though that love might bear the marks of strain .
In these works the humour arises from the childs curiosity and the playful or self-serving lies the parent tells him in instructing him to do a chore or in order to stop the incessant questions .
Cutler earned a faithful cult following .
John Peel once remarked that Cutler was probably the only performer whose work had been featured on Radio 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 .
Cutler was a member of the Noise Abatement Society and the Voluntary Euthanasia Society .
He retired from performing in 2004 , and died on 3 March 2006 .
The reception room of his home contained a number of pieces of ivory cutlery , intended as a pun on his name .
Cutler was born in Glasgow into a middle-class Jewish family of Eastern European descent .
He cited his childhood as the source of his artistic temperament , recalling a sense of displacement when his younger brother was born : Without that I would not have been so screwed up as I am , and therefore not as creative .
In 1939 Cutler was evacuated to Annan .
He joined the Royal Air Force as a navigator in 1942 but was soon dismissed for dreaminess .
He moved to London where he was employed by the Inner London Education Authority to teach music , dance , drama and poetry to 7 - to 11-year-olds .
Cutlers deeply held views on humanity meant he disliked corporal punishment and on leaving a teaching job he held in the 1950s he cut up his tawse and handed the pieces to the class .
He was married briefly and had two children .
Cutler began writing songs and poetry in the late 1950s , making the first of many appearances on BBC radio on the Home Service , where he featured on the Monday Night at Home programme on 38 occasions between 1959 and 1963 .
He gained popularity playing songs where he would often accompany himself on either a piano or the harmonium , and this success led to the release of a series of records starting with 1959s Ivor Cutler of YHup EP .
Cutler continued to make appearances on the BBCs programmes during the 1960s , and as a result of an appearance on the television show Late Night Line-Up , he was noticed by Paul McCartney , who invited Cutler to appear in The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour film .
In the film , Cutler plays bus conductor Buster Bloodvessel , who becomes passionately attracted to Ringo Starr s Aunt Jessie .
Following this film role , Cutler recorded an LP , Ludo , produced by The Beatles George Martin , and credited to the Ivor Cutler Trio , made up of Cutler with bassist Gill Lyons and percussionist Trevor Tomkins .
The LP , taking inspiration from trad jazz and boogie-woogie , sees Cutler playing the piano as well as his usual harmonium , and is considered the most traditionally musical of all his records .
After its release Cutler continued to perform for BBC radio , recording the first of his sessions for John Peel in 1969 .
Cutlers work on Peels shows would introduce him to successive generations of fans , and in the early 1990s , Cutler said , Thanks to Peel , I gained a whole new audience , to the amazement of my older fans , who find themselves among 16-to-35s in theatres , and wonder where they came from .
In the 1970s , Neil Ardley had Cutler sing on his A Symphony of Amaranths LP , and former - Soft Machine singer Robert Wyatt asked Cutler to play harmonium and sing on two of the tracks on his Rock Bottom LP .
The collaboration with Wyatt led to Cutler being signed to Wyatts record label Virgin Records , for whom Cutler recorded three LPs in the mid-1970s : Dandruff , Velvet Donkey and Jammy Smears .
Each of these discs intersperses Cutlers poems and songs with readings by his performing companion Phyllis King .
During the decade Cutler used his sessions for John Peel to introduce numerous episodes of his Life in a Scotch Sitting Room series , culminating in the 1978 LP Life in a Scotch Sitting Room , Vol .
2 , regarded as a particularly autobiographical work , on which Cutler recounts tales from his childhood amid an environment of exaggerated Scottishness .
Cutler also produced the work as a book , which was published in 1984 with illustrations by Martin Honeysett .
He also collaborated with Portal artist Frances Broomfield on an illustrated alphabet book , which was never completed .
Cutler contributed the track Brooch Boat to the cult 1980 album Miniatures , produced and edited by Morgan Fisher , which consisted entirely of one-minute-long recordings .
In the 1980s , Rough Trade Records released three LPs -- Privilege , Prince Ivor and Gruts .
Cutler also released the single Women of the World , recorded with Linda Hirst , through the label in 1983 .
He enjoyed further interest from the Creation record company in the 1990s , best known at the time as Oasis record label .
The label released two new volumes of poems and spoken word work : A Wet Handle and A Flat Man

In Hindustani music , a gharana is a system of social organization linking musicians or dancers by lineage or apprenticeship , and by adherence to a particular musical style .
A gharana also indicates a comprehensive musicological ideology .
This ideology sometimes changes substantially from one gharana to another .
It directly affects the thinking , teaching , performance and appreciation of music .
The word gharana comes from the Hindi word ghar , which means family or house .
It typically refers to the place where the musical ideology originated ; for example , some of the gharanas well known for singing khyals are : Agra , Gwalior , Indore , Jaipur , Kirana , and Patiala .
The gharana system in khyal was rooted in the guru-shishya tradition and was similar to the Dhrupad Bani system .
The gharana system was greatly influenced by the gradual fall of the Mughal Empire , which forced musicians to move from Delhi to princely states such as Gwalior , Lucknow , Hyderabad , Patiala and Rampur .
The gharanas have distinct styles of presenting the khyal -- how much to emphasize and how to enunciate the words of the composition , when to sing the sthayi and antara , whether to sing an unmetered alap in the beginning , what kinds of improvisations to use , how much importance to give to the rhythmic aspect , and so on .
However , an individual performer from a gharana may choose to borrow appealing stylistic aspects of another gharana in his or her gayaki .
The prominent khyal gharanas are : .
In the Benares Thumri Gharana , the words in the text of a song are musically embellished to bring out their meaning , while the Lucknow gharana presents intricately embellished and delicate thumris that are explicit in their eroticism .
The principal feature of the thumri of the Patiala gharana is its incorporation of the tappa from the Punjab region .
It is with this tappa element that the Patiala gharana makes its impact , departing from the khyal - dominated Benaras thumris and the dance-oriented Lucknow thumris .
The following are the six widely accepted Tabla Gharanas .
The prominent Tabla Gharanas are in bold : .
In Kathak performers today generally draw their lineage from three major schools of Kathak : the Jaipur gharana , the Lucknow gharana and the Banaras gharana ; there is also a less prominent Raigarh gharana which amalgamated technique from all three preceding gharanas but became famous for its own distinctive compositions
The Sarana Chatushtai is the only experiment according to Bharata Muni to obtain the correct physical configuration of Sruti swara arrangement to Shadja Grama Notes on a musical instrument .
The 22 Srutis are the only notes which can be useful for music in an `` octave '' , in this view .
The sections below describe the experiment .
Sarana Chatushtai experiment on two similar sitars .
The two veenas or sitars having the same qualities in all respect can be used to perform the Sarana Chatushtai experiment .
Establish the Shadjagrama on both the similar sitars as per the methodology explained in Natya Shastra chapter 28 to keep shruties distance wise for the respective notes of the shadjagrama .
Now we can measure the sruti value and hence provide 22 frets starting from the 5th sruti of second note Re .
The assumption here which needs to be made to realize Bharata Munis shruti of first datum note being the sound of free string Sa , requires the assumption of 4 virtual shruties of Sa which are actually obtained in the higher octave after Ni .
This assumption though not explicitly stated in the Natya Shastra needs to be made as was discovered by Avinash Balkrishna Patwardhan and is required to prove the Sarana Chatushtai experiment .
The shruti distances as per the compression factors are calculated for all the 34 length of the string .
18 frets are required to reach up to the end note Ni of the saptak in both the instruments .
When finally both the instruments are set in the Shadjagrama , one sitar is to be kept as Achala i.e. the string tuning of this instrument remains unchanged during the entire experiment , whereas the other sitar is named as Chala i.e. the changes in tuning strings during the experiment are to be performed on this sitar .
The Panchama note of this Chala sitar is to be lowered by one Pramana-Shruti that is to bring this sitar in the Madhyamagrama .
The procedure of Bharata states that the Achala sitar Re note is first played as Sa note and the Pa note of the Chala sitar is lowered down in sound to be played as Ma note of the Achala sitars Re note .
Setting the Chala sitar in the Madhyamagrama by lowering the Pa note by one Pramana Shruti is the first part of the first Sarana .
The next part is to sound the Chala sitar to Shadjagrama tune .
Here all notes on the Chala sitar will sound less by one Pramana shruti than the notes on the permanently set Achala sitar in the Shadjagrama .
Repeat the above mentioned procedure to further lower down the Chala sitar by one more Pramana Sruti .
Here we find when asked to play both the instruments , then the Ga note of Achala sitar will exactly match in tune or rather merge with the Re note of the Chala sitar , and the Ni note of Achala instrument merges with the Dha note of the Chala sitar .
Here we get the pair of 2 shruti values .
Repeat the above procedure once again and further lower down the Chala sitar by one more sruti in shadjagrama .
Now the difference in both the instruments set in Shadjagrama is of 3 Pramana Shruti values .
Here we see the notes Sa and Pa of Achala sitar will merge in Re & Dha notes of Chala sitar .
Repeat this procedure once again to finally bring down the Chala sitar lower by 4 sruties than the Achala sitar initially set in Shadjagrama .
Here we find the notes Ni , Ga , Ma of Achala sitar are found merging in the notes Sa , Ma and Pa of the Chala sitar .
Only when all 4 sarana 's are successfully tuned and the sound notes cross checked as mentioned by Bharata , then only one can know the 22 shrutis of Shadjagrama as required by the Natya Shastra

Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar was a Hindustani musician .
He sang the original version of the bhajan Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram , and founded the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya in 1901 .
His original surname was Gadgil , but as they hailed from the village Palus , they came to be known as the Paluskar family .
Vishnu Digambar Paluskar was born in a Marathi family of Kurundwad , a small town falling under the Deccan division of Bombay Presidency during British rule , presently in Maharashtra .
His father , Digambar Gopal Paluskar , was a singer of Kirtan .
He went to a local school in Kurundwad for primary education .
But tragedy struck Paluskar at an early age .
During a Hindu festival called Datta Jayanti , a fire-cracker burst near his face damaging both his eyes .
Being a small town , there was no immediate treatment available and Paluskar lost his eyesight .
Nevertheless , he regained it some years later .
The king of Miraj recognising the talent in the boy put him under the guidance of Balakrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar , a learned musician .
Paluskar trained under him for 12 years until in 1896 the relations between the teacher and student became strained .
After that Paluskar began touring the country and studied the musical traditions in each part of Northern India .
He went from place to place and visited many royal families in cities like Baroda and Gwalior , well known for their patronage of musicians .
But he broke a long standing tradition of Indian music by giving a public concert in Saurashtra and charging a nominal fee .
Till then , concerts were given only in palaces or temples .
He studied Brijbhasha , a dialect of Hindi , spoken at Mathura .
Vishnu Digambar met Pandit Chandan Chaube and learnt Dhrupad music from him .
In 1901 , he reached Lahore , where he decided to establish a music school .
On May 5 , 1901 Paluskar founded the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya , a School to impart formal training in Indian classical music .
This was a school open to all and one of the first in India to run on public support and donations , rather than royal patronage .
It was a challenge to the traditional method where a student lived under the teachers roof .
Many students from the Schools early batches became respected musicians and teachers in North India .
This brought respect to musicians , who were treated with disdain earlier .
In September 1908 , Paluskar went to Bombay to establish another branch of the School .
As the work-load increased , he shifted the school from Lahore to Bombay .
To accommodate all the students , he took loans , built a new building for the school and hostel as well .
To settle debts , he gave several public concerts .
But while on a concert tour in 1924 , Paluskars creditors attached his properties and auctioned off the school .
Paluskar died on August 21 , 1931 .
On July 21 , 1973 , the Posts and Telegraph Department , Government of India paid homage to Pandit Paluskar by releasing a commemorative stamp .
Today Paluskar is seen as the musician who brought respect to the profession of classical musicians and took Hindustani classical music out from the traditional Gharana system to the masses .
He has written a book on music called Sangeet Bal Prakash in three volumes , and 18 volumes on ragas as well .
His disciples -- famously Vinayakrao Patwardhan , Omkarnath Thakur , Narayanrao Vyas , Shankarrao Vyas , and B. R. Deodhar -- became renowned classical singers and teachers .
His son Dattatreya Vishnu Paluskar was also trained in classical music and carried on his fathers mission .
In 2000 , the India Today magazine named Pandit Paluskar to be one of the 100 people who shaped India

Dhrupad is a vocal genre in Hindustani classical music , said to be the oldest still in use in that musical tradition .
Its name is derived from the words dhruva and pada , where a part of the poem is used as a refrain .
The term may denote both the verse form of the poetry and the style in which it is sung .
Abul Fazl , courtier and chronicler at the court of the Emperor Akbar , defines the dhrupad verse form in his Ain-e-Akbari as four rhyming lines , each of indefinite prosodic length .
Thematic matter ranges from the religious and spiritual to royal panegyrics , musicology and romance .
Though Dhrupad is basically a vocal tradition , its musical aesthetics have been adopted by many instrumentalists .
Not only by various schools of Rudra Veena players but also by other instrumentalists , who look to Dhrupad for examples for their instrumental developments of raga , and go as far as to adapt the format : a slow , unmetered alaapa , Jhor , Jhala , to be concluded with one or more compositions in contrasting talas .
Ram Narayan and Hariprasad Chaurasia , to name but two acclaimed instrumentalists , pay homage to Dhrupad in the way they present a raga .
The earliest source that mentions a musical genre called Dhrupad is Ain-i-Akbari of Abu Fazl .
Later works attribute much of the material to musicians in the court of Man Singh Tomar of Gwalior .
In these accounts from the Mughal court Dhrupad is portrayed as a musical form which is relatively new ; and according to Sanyal , most sources agree that Drupad owes its origin to the court of Man Singh Tomar .
There is reference to Dhrupad in Bharats Natya Shastra , commonly dated to the 1st Century AD , and even in Sangit Ratnakar , a 13th Century text , taken as authoritative .
Ravi Shankar states that the form appeared in the fifteenth century as a development from the prabandha , which it replaced .
Under Mughal rule it was appropriated as court music .
However the musical background of dhrupad is commonly thought to have a long history , traceable back to the Vedas themselves .
The Yugala Shataka of Shri Shribhatta in the Nimbarka Sampradaya , written in 1294 CE , contains lyrics of similar fashion .
Swami Haridas , the guru of Tansen , was a well known dhrupad singer .
The 18th Century saw the beginning of a great decline of dhrupad singing .
A newer genre , khyal , which had coexisted with dhrupad for a couple of centuries , and which emerged partly as a reaction against so-called nibaddha or pre-composed music , gained popularity at dhrupads expense , placing fewer constraints on the singers and allowing greater improvisation and displays of virtuosity rare in dhrupad .
Also , new instruments were being developed - the sitar and the sarod - that were not suited to the slow tempo and low register favoured by dhrupad so that dhrupad instrumental also began to lose ground .
Only a few families carried on the tradition .
In 1960 the French ethnomusicologist Alain Danielou invited Nasir Moinuddin and Nasir Aminuddin Dagar to perform in Europe .
Their concerts were successful and , upon the untimely demise of Nasir Moinuddin in 1966 , his younger brothers Nasir Zahiruddin and Nasir Fayazuddin continued .
The Dagars toured widely and recorded .
Coinciding with growing foreign interest in Indian music , the Dagarvani-revival helped breathe new life into a few other families of dhrupad singers .
Today , dhrupad enjoys a place as a well-respected but not widely popular genre , no longer on the brink of extinction .
Dhrupad as we know it today is performed by a solo singer or a small number of singers in unison to the beat of the pakhavaj or mridang rather than the tabla .
The vocalist is usually accompanied by two tanpuras , the players sitting close behind , with the percussionist at the right of the vocalist .
Traditionally the only other instrument used was the Rudra Veena .
Some artists have used other instruments .
Preferably , such instruments should have a deep bass register and long sustain .
Like all Indian classical music , dhrupad is modal and monophonic , with a single melodic line and no chord progression .
Each raga has a modal frame - a wealth of micro-tonal ornamentations are typical .
The text is preceded by a wholly improvised section , the alap .
The alap in dhrupad is sung using a set of syllables , popularly thought to be derived from a mantra , in a recurrent , set pattern : a re ne na , te te re ne na , ri re re ne na , te ne toom ne .
Dhrupad styles have long elaborate alaps , their slow and deliberate melodic development gradually bringing an accelerating rhythmic pulse .
In most styles of dhrupad singing it can easily last an hour , broadly subdivided into the alap proper , the jor and the jhala or nomtom , when syllables are sung at a very rapid pace .
Then the composition is sung to the rhythmic accompaniment : the four lines , in serial order , are termed sthayi , antara , sanchari and aabhog .
Compositions exist in the metres tivra , sul and chau - a composition set to the 10-beat jhap tala is called a sadra while one set to the 14-beat dhamar is called a dhamar .
The latter is seen as a lighter musical form , associated with the Holi spring festival .
Alongside concert performance the practice of singing dhrupad in temples continues , though only a small number of recordings have been made .
It bears little resemblance to concert dhrupad : there is very little or no alap ; percussion such as bells and finger cymbals , not used in the classical setting , are used here , and the drum used is a smaller , older variant called mrdang , quite similar to the mridangam .
There are said to be four broad stylistic variants of classical dhrupad - the Gauri , Khandar , Nauhar , and Dagar , tentatively linked to five singing styles known from the 7th Century : Shuddha , Bhinna , Gauri , Vegswara , and Sadharani .
But more importantly , there are a number of dhrupad gharanas : houses , or family styles .
The best-known gharana is the Dagar family , who sing in the Dagar vani .
The Dagar style puts great emphasis on alap and for several generations their singers have performed in pairs .
The Dagars are Muslims but sing Hindu texts of Gods and Goddesses .
Some of the best dhrupad singers outside the Dagar family , such as Uday Bhawalkar , Ritwik Sanyal and the Gundecha Brothers , also belong to the Dagar vani .
From Bihar state come two other gharanas , the Malliks and the Mishras .
The Malliks are linked to the Khandar vani and emphasize the composed song over improvised alap with variety of layakaris .
Ram Chatur Mallik , Vidur Mallick , and Siyaram Tiwari were well known exponents of Darbhanga gharana in the last century .
Today the senior performer of the Darbhanga gharana is Prem Kumar Mallick .
Prashant Kumar Mallick and Nishant Kumar Mallick are Dhrupad vocalist among young generation of Darbhanga tradition .
The Mishras practise both Nauhar and Khandar styles with some unique techniques for nomtom alap .
This gharana flourished under the patronage of the kings of Bettiah Raj .
The most famous exponents of the Bettiah gharana today are Indrakishore Mishra and Falguni Mitra .
The form of dhrupad prevalent in Darbhanga and Bettiah is known as the Haveli style .
In Pakistan dhrupad is represented by the Talwandi gharana , who sing in the Khandar style

Chants of India is an album by Indian musician Ravi Shankar released in 1997 on Angel Records .
Produced by his friend and sometime collaborator George Harrison , the album consists of Vedic and other Hindu sacred prayers set to music , marking a departure from Shankars more familiar work in the field of Hindustani classical music .
The lyrical themes of the recorded chants are peace and harmony among nature and all creatures .
Sessions for the album took place in the Indian city of Madras and at Harrisons home in Henley-on-Thames , Oxfordshire , following his work on The Beatles Anthology .
Anoushka Shankar , John Barham , Bikram Ghosh , Tarun Bhatacharaya and Ronu Majumdar are among the many musicians who contributed to the recording .
Chants of India was well received by reviewers ; author Peter Lavezzoli describes it as a quiet masterpiece and the most fully realized collaboration by Shankar and Harrison .
Shankar considered it to be among the best works of his 60-year career .
In 2010 , the album was reissued as part of the Dark Horse Records box set Ravi Shankar-George Harrison , Collaborations , which combined various projects undertaken by the two artists , beginning in 1973 .
Chants of India was the last formal collaboration between Shankar and Harrison , who was diagnosed with cancer shortly after its release .
At the Concert for George in November 2002 , Shankar incorporated some of the selections from Chants of India , including the album-closing Sarve Shaam , in a set performed by daughter Anoushka as a tribute to Harrison .
Having maintained a close friendship in the decades since their last official collaboration in 1974 , Ravi Shankar and George Harrison began working together in 1995 on projects to celebrate Shankars 75th birthday .
Harrison first produced a four-disc career retrospective issued on EMI s Angel Records , Ravi Shankar : In Celebration , which also included unreleased recordings made by the pair , before serving as editor on Shankars second autobiography , Raga Mala .
When compiling In Celebration , Shankar and Harrison discussed with Angel Records the possibility of making an album of Vedic chants and other Hindu sacred texts set to music .
According to Shankar , the record company were hoping to repeat the commercial success of a recording by those Spanish monks .
Shankar had grown up in the Hindu holy city of Benares , where the public chanting of Vedic hymns his passion for music , author Reginald Massey writes , and as a young man during the 1940s he had embraced the concept of Nada Brahma , under the strict tutelage of music guru Allauddin Khan .
In his liner notes to Chants of India , Shankar nevertheless describes the undertaking as one of the most difficult challenges in my life , as a composer and arranger .
Shankar noted the precedents for such a venture : Sanskrit chants from the Vedas , Upanishads and other scriptures have been recorded by many in India and elsewhere , either in its original form by the Traditional Scholars ... or sung within raga forms by eminent musicians with accompanying instruments .
Some have even attempted to make them more popular by using a semi-classical and commercial approach .
I wanted to make a version different from all these , but still maintain the tremendous spiritual force , and purity of the Suktas , Shlokas and Mantras , and at the same time make it universally appealing .
Harrison biographer Gary Tillery describes the songs focus , following the opening invocations , as peace , love , ecology , and social harmony .
Chants of India reunited Shankar and Harrison with English musician and arranger John Barham .
Barham provided Western annotation of Shankars melodies , a role he had first supplied for Shankar at the Bath Music Festival in 1966 , when the Indian sitar virtuoso had duetted with Yehudi Menuhin .
Anoushka Shankar conducted the musicians at the sessions , Shankar and Harrison decided to move the project to Harrisons recording facility at Friar Park , his home in Henley-on-Thames , Oxfordshire .
According to Tillery , Madras had been chosen in order to cultivate authenticity , being a music capital of the South Asian region , yet the atmosphere at Sruthilaya seemed too secular for the aura of spirituality they wanted to create .
A large cast of local musicians contributed to the recording in Madras , on instruments such as veena , violin , flute , cello , tanpura and mridangam , while the chorus singers numbered 21 .
The pilgrimage inspired him in his current work with Shankar , author Joshua Greene writes , just as a 1974 visit to Vrindavan had been the catalyst for staging Shankars Music Festival from India revue and their joint North American tour that year .
In July 1996 , Shankar and Harrison reconvened at Friar Park , after Harrison had recorded a contribution for Carl Perkins Go , Cat , Go !
album .
The Friar Park sessions for Chants of India took place in the houses drawing room , with cables fed through from the studio area above - the same arrangement under which Harrison had produced the Music Festival from India studio album , in summer 1974 .
From 7 July , sessions ran intermittently through to late August .
Shankar later told Rolling Stone magazine that he wrote Mangalam at this time : Mangalam came to me while I was walking in Friar Park , Georges place , where we were recording .
I was looking at the trees and the sky , and feeling very elated all of a sudden , wishing everything should be good for everyone , and it just came to me .
Among the participating musicians at Friar Park were Shankars occasional tabla player Bikram Ghosh , along with Tarun Bhatacharaya , Ronu Mazumdar and Jane LIster .
Shankars wife Sukanya , a trained singer in the Karnatak tradition , was also among the vocalists during what the album sleeve lists as the London sessions .
Harrison was so moved that he embraced me with tears in his eyes and simply said , Thank you , Ravi , for this music .
According to Lavezzoli , the album was one of Shankars personal favorite works .
Angel Records issued Chants of India on 6 May 1997 in America , with a UK release following on 1 September .
The album was marketed as a collaborative work , and Harrison joined Shankar in promoting the release .
These activities included television appearances in New York and Paris , one of which , for Americas VH1 network , aired on 24 July as George & Ravi - Yin & Yang .
In what would turn out to be Harrisons final performance on a TV show , he and Shankar discussed the album and their shared experiences , such as the Concert for Bangladesh .
Harrison then accepted an acoustic guitar from host John Fugelsang and performed songs including the just-released Prabhujee , sung with Ravi and Sukanya Shankar .
Chants of India was critically well-received , while commercially it peaked at number 3 on Billboard magazines Top World Music Albums chart .
Peter Lavezzoli writes of the album : Chants of India is a quiet masterpiece , one of the most uplifting and musically engaging recordings of scared music ... Harrisons production created the ideal setting for each chant , all of which are exquisitely sung , and the album remains the most fully realized collaboration between both artists .
Jim Brenholts of Allmusic similarly praises the work : Shankars style and diversity allow him to open doors that are closed to other musicians ... Shankars compositional and sound-design styles add atmosphere .
Harrisons deft touch allows the music to develop and maintain its own integrity .
Among records of this nature , this one is special .
Harrison biographer Alan Clayson describes Chants of India as a thoroughly diverting production that sung lyrics as succinct as haiku and instrumental passages of a quirky complexity vaguely reminiscent of Frank Zappa .
Chants of India was the last formal musical collaboration between Shankar and Harrison .
During promotion for the album in summer 1997 , Harrison was diagnosed with cancer , a condition he was then thought to have beaten until a near-fatal stabbing by a deranged fan , on 30 December 1999 , encouraged its return .
On 29 November 2002 , a year after his death at the age of 58 , Shankar included selections from Chants of India in the opening , Indian music portion of the Concert for George , held at the Royal Albert Hall in London .
Anoushka Shankar performed the set , as sitarist and conductor , backed by some of the musicians and singers who had contributed to the Friar Park sessions in 1996 , including Sukanya Shankar , Chandrashekhar , M. Balachandar and Lister .
The album-closing Sarve Shaam appears at the start of David Leland s Concert for George documentary film , .
As part of Ravi Shankars 90th birthday celebrations in 2010 , Dark Horse Records reissued Chants of India in a four-disc box set titled Ravi Shankar-George Harrison Collaborations .
A project overseen and produced by Olivia Harrison , the box set also included the albums Shankar Family & Friends and Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India , together with previously unreleased film of the Music Festivals debut performance in September 1974 , directed by Stuart Cooper .
All songs are traditional , adapted by Ravi Shankar , except where noted
Sohni is a raga in Hindustani classical music in the Marwa thaat .
Alternate transliterations include Sohani and Sohini .
Like Bahar , it is a small raga , with not much space for elaboration .
It emotes the feel of longing , of passive sensuousness .
The raga is of audav-shadav nature , i.e , it has five swaras in the arohana and six in the avarohana .
Rishabh is komal and Madhyam is Tivra , while all other swaras are shuddha .
Pancham is not used .
Pakad : 1 .
Sa Ni Dha , Ga Ma # Dha Ga Ma # Ga. 2 .
Sa Ni Dha , Ni Dha Ga Ma # , Ga Ma # , Ga Re # Sa .
The rishabh is weak , but Gandhar is strong , unlike Marwa .
It is an Uttaranga pradhan raga , with the higher notes on the saptak being used more frequently .
Raga Sohni is associated with very late night / pre-dawn , the last or eighth period of day , roughly from 3-6AM .
It is somewhat similar to Marwa and Puriya ragas in the same thaat , and also to Basant in the Poorvi thaat

Bade Ghulam Ali Khan was a Hindustani classical vocalist , from the Patiala gharana .
Khan was born in Kasur , then in the Punjab province in British India ; after partition , Kasur became a part of Pakistan .
His father was a famous singer , Ali Baksh Khan , in a West Punjabi family of musical heritage .
At the age of seven , he learned Sarangi and vocal from his paternal uncle Kale Khan , who was also a singer and composer of repute , and after his death he picked up a few compositions from his father who had re-married by this time .
This tenure lasted for almost three years .
It was at this juncture that he improvised the musical instrument Kanun to the present Swarmandal which became his trademark .
When he was about 21 years old , he moved to Benaras where he accompanied a courtesan named Zarabai on the Sarangi and started to perform in public .
Though Khan started his career by accompanying female singers on the sarangi , he also used to sing a few compositions of his late uncle .
He was also a disciple of both Ustad Akhtar Hussain Khan and Ustad Ashiq Ali Khan , two scions of the Patiala Gharana .
He became popular as a vocalist after his debut concert in Kolkata .
Khan amalgamated the best of four traditions : his own Patiala-Kasur style , the Behram Khani elements of Dhrupad , the gyrations of Jaipur , and the behlavas of Gwalior .
His voice had a wide range , spanning three octaves , effortless rendition , sweetness , flexibility and ease of movement in all tempi .
His raga expositions were brief , contrary to convention , and while he agreed that the beauty of classical music lay in leisurely improvisation , he believed that the audience would not appreciate long alaps , and he had to sing for the masses and change the music to what the audience wanted .
After the partition of India in 1947 , Khan went to his home in Pakistan , but returned to India later to reside permanently .
He did not approve of the partition , stating : If in every home one child was taught Hindustani classical music this country would never have been partitioned .
In 1957 , with the help of Bombay chief minister Morarji Desai , he acquired Indian citizenship and moved to a government-provided bungalow at Malabar Hill .
He lived at various times in Lahore , Bombay , Calcutta , and Hyderabad .
For a long time , Bade Ghulam Ali stayed away from singing in films despite requests and persuasions from well known producers and music directors .
However , he was coaxed and convinced by K. Asif to sing two songs based on ragas Sohni and Rageshree for the 1960 film Mughal-e-Azam , with the music directed by Naushad .
He demanded a very , very high price , reportedly Rs .
25,000 per song , when the rate for popular and star playback singers such as Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi was below Rs .
500 per song .
Khan was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and the Padma Bhushan in 1962 .
Khan died in Hyderabad at Basheerbagh Palace in 1968 , after a prolonged illness which left him partially paralysed in his last years .
He continued to sing and perform in public with the support of his son Munawar Ali Khan until his death .
Today , the Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Yaadgar Sabha , founded by his disciple Malti Gilani , keeps his music and memory alive .
It aims to promote Hindustani classical music and organises many concerts to this end .
Its primary aim , however , is to provide medical aid to ailing musicians .
The Sabha organises a Sabrang Utsav every year in the memory of the maestro .
Under his pen name , Sabrang , Khan left numerous compositions .
Khan was married to Ali Jiwai , who died in 1932 .
His son Munawar was a classical singer .
His grandson , Raza Ali Khan , is also a classical singer .
Many years after the death of his first wife Allah Jiwai , he married an issueless widow , Allah Rakhi , who survived him and died on 11 August 1996 .
The main street at Basheerbagh is named Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan Marg in his honour

Tala , Taal or Tal , is the term used in Indian classical music for the rhythmic pattern of any composition and for the entire subject of rhythm , roughly corresponding to metre in Western music , though closer conceptual equivalents are to be found in the older system of rhythmic mode and its relations with the foot of classical poetry , or with other Asian classical systems such as the notion of usul in the theory of Ottoman/Turkish music .
A tala is a regular , repeating rhythmic phrase , particularly as rendered on a percussive instrument with an ebb and flow of various intonations represented as a theka , a sequence of drum-syllables or bol .
Indian classical music , both northern and southern , has complex , all-embracing rules for the elaboration of possible patterns and each such pattern has its own name , though in practice a few talas are very common while others are rare .
The most common instrument for keeping rhythm in Hindustani music is the tabla , while in Carnatic music it is the mridangam .
Each repeated cycle of a tala is called an avartan .
This is counted additively in sections which roughly correspond to bars or measures but may not have the same number of beats and may be marked by accents or rests .
So the Hindustani Jhoomra tal has 14 beats , counted 3 +4 +3 +4 , which differs from Dhamar tal , also of 14 beats but counted 5 +2 +3 +4 .
The spacing of the vibhag accents makes them distinct , otherwise , again , since Rupak tal consists of 7 beats , two cycles of it of would be indistinguishable from one cycle of the related Dhamar tal .
However the most common Hindustani tala , Teental , is a regularly-divisible cycle of four measures of four beats each .
The first beat of any tala , called sam is always the most important and heavily emphasised .
It is the point of resolution in the rhythm where the percussionists and soloists phrases culminate : a soloist has to sound an important note of the raga there , and a North Indian classical dance composition must end there .
However , melodies do not always begin on the first beat of the tala but may be offset , for example to suit the words of a composition so that the most accented word falls upon the sam .
The term talli , literally shift , is used to describe this offset in Tamil .
A composition may also start with an anacrusis on one of the last beats of the previous cycle of the tala , called ateeta eduppu in Tamil .
The tala is indicated visually by using a series of rhythmic hand gestures called kriyas that correspond to the angas or limbs , or vibhag of the tala .
These movements define the tala in Carnatic music , and in the Hindustani tradition too , when learning and reciting the tala , the first beat of any vibhag is known as tali and is accompanied by a clap of the hands , while an empty vibhag is indicated with a sideways wave of the dominant clapping hand or the placing of the back of the hand upon the base hands palm instead .
But northern definitions of tala rely far more upon specific drum-strokes , known as bols , each with its own name that can be vocalized as well as written .
In one common notation the sam is denoted by an X and the khali , which is always the first beat of a particular vibhag , denoted by 0 .
A tala does not have a fixed tempo and can be played at different speeds .
In Hindustani classical music a typical recital of a raga falls into two or three parts categorized by the quickening tempo of the music ; Vilambit , Madhya and Drut .
Carnatic music adds an extra slow and fast category , categorised by divisions of the pulse ; Chauka , Vilamba , Madhyama , Dhuridha and lastly Adi-dhuridha .
Carnatic music uses various classification systems of talas such as the Chapu , Chanda and Melakarta .
The Suladi Sapta Tala system is used here , according to which there are seven families of tala .
A tala can not exist without reference to one of five jatis , differentiated by the length in beats of the laghu , thus allowing thirty-five possible talas .
With all possible combinations of tala types and laghu lengths , there are 5 x 7 = 35 talas having lengths ranging from 3 to 29 aksharas .
The seven tala families and the number of aksharas for each of the 35 talas are ; .
In practice , only a few talas have compositions set to them .
The most common tala is Chaturasra-nadai Chaturasra-jaati Triputa tala , also called Adi tala .
Nadai is a term which means subdivision of beats .
Many kritis and around half of the varnams are set to this tala .
Other common talas include : .
The Suladi Saptha Tala system uses three of six possible angas in different arrangements ; .
Each tala can incorporate one of five jatis .
Each tala family has a default jati associated with it ; the tala name mentioned without qualification refers to the default jati ; .
For example one cycle of khanda-jati rupaka tala comprises a 2-beat dhrutam followed by a 5-beat laghu .
cycle is thus 7 aksharas long .
Chaturasra jati khanda-jati Rupaka tala has 7 aksharam , each of which is 4 matras long ; each avartana of the tala is 4 x 7 = 28 matras long .
For Misra-jati Khanda-jati Rupaka tala , it would be 7 x 7 = 49 matra .
The number of maatras in an akshara is called the nadai .
This number can be 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 or 9 , and take the same name as the jatis .
The default nadai is Chatusram : .
Sometimes , pallavis are sung as part of a Ragam Thanam Pallavi exposition in some of the rarer , more complicated talas ; such pallavis , if sung in a non-Chatusra-nadai tala , are called nadai pallavis .
In addition , pallavis are often sung in chauka kale , although this trend seems to be slowing .
Talas have a vocalised and therefore recordable form wherein individual beats are expressed as phonetic representations of various strokes played upon the tabla .
Various Gharanas also have their own preferences .
For example , the Kirana Gharana uses Ektaal more frequently for Vilambit Khayal while the Jaipur Gharana uses Trital .
Jaipur Gharana is also known to use Ada Trital , a variation of Trital for transitioning from Vilambit to Drut laey .
The khal vibhag has no beats on the bayan , i.e. no bass beats this can be seen as a way to enforce the balance between the usage of heavy and fine beats or more simply it can be thought of another mnemonic to keep track of the rhythmic cycle .
The khali is played with a stressed syllable that can easily be picked out from the surrounding beats .
Some rare talas even contain a half-beat .
For example , Dharami is an 11 1/2 beat cycle where the final Ka only occupies half the time of the other beats .
This talas 6th beat does not have a played syllable - in western terms it is a rest .
Some talas , for example Dhamaar , Ek , Jhoomra and Chau talas , lend themselves better to slow and medium tempos .
Others flourish at faster speeds , like Jhap or Rupak talas .
Trital or Teental is one of the most popular , since it is as aesthetic at slower tempos as it is at faster speeds .
There are many taals in Hindustani music , some of the more popular ones are : .
Other than these 35 talas there are 108 so-called anga talas .
The following is the exhaustive pattern of beats used in constructing them .
Compositions are rare in these lengthy talas .
They are mostly used in performing the Pallavi of Ragam Thanam Pallavis .
Some examples of anga talas are : .
Another type of tala is the chhanda tala .
These are talas set to the lyrics of the Thirupugazh by the Tamil composer Arunagirinathar .
He is said to have written 16000 hyms each in a different chhanda tala .
Of these , only 1500-2000 are available

When Guru Dutt made comparatively light-weight films like Baazi and Jaal , Burmanda reflected their mood with compositions like Suno Gajar Kya Gaye or De Bhi Chuke Hum and when Guru Dutt made his somber masterpieces - Pyaasa and Kaagaz ke Phool , he was right on target with Jinhe Naaz Hai Hind and Waqt ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam .
In 2004 , the soundtrack for Pyaasa was chosen as one of The Best Music in Film by Sight & Sound , the British Film Institute magazine .
In 1957 , S D Burman fell out with Lata Mangeshkar and adopted her younger sister Asha Bhosle as his lead female singer .
The team of S D Burman , Kishore Kumar , Asha Bhosle and lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri became popular for their duet songs .
Thus , he was responsible along with O. P. Nayyar for shaping Asha Bhosle as a singer of repute , who became his daughter-in-law after she married Rahul Dev Burman .
In 1958 , S D Burman gave music for Kishore Kumar s house production Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi , the same year he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for Music direction of Lajwanti and remains the only music director to have won the prestigious award .
Early on in his career , Burman refused to allow his voice be lip-synced on film by actors , as a result , even later on , in Hindi cinema , his thin yet powerful voice was often used as bardic commentary to haunting results , as in Ore Majhi Mere Sajan Hai Us Paar Bandini , Wahaan Kaun hai Tera from Guide and finally Safal Hogi Teri Aradhana from Aradhana , for which he received the National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the year , 1970 .
Ill health caused a slump in his career in the early 1960s but he gave many hit films in late 1960s .
In 1961 , S D Burman and Lata Mangeshkar came together during the recording of R.D. Burman s first song for the movie Chhote Nawab .
They reconciled their differences and started working again in 1962 .
The Dev Anand - S D Burman partnership , under Navketan banner , continued to churn out musical hits like Bombai Ka Baboo , Tere Ghar Ke Samne , Teen Devian , Guide and Jewel Thief .
In 1963 , he composed songs for Meri Surat Teri Aankhen and Manna Dey sang the song Poocho Na Kaise Maine in raga Ahir Bhairav .
This song is based on a Bengali composition by Kazi Nazrul Islam , Aruno-kaanti ke go jogi bhikaari , based on raga bhairavi .
That Movie also had a Song , Nache Mann Mora Magan , sung by Rafi , which songs Sachin Das capability to compose classical songs .
Other S D Burman hits from this period were Bandini and Ziddi .
In Bandini , Sampooran Singh , made his debut as a lyricist with the song Mora Gora Ang lai le , mohe shaam rang daai de , although other songs were written by Shailendra .
Guide starring Dev Anand , was probably the best of his work during the time with all the songs super hit as well as the film ; but unfortunately it did not receive the Filmfare Award in best music director category for that year , which remained always a discussion among the Bollywood film pandits .
Aradhana is considered a landmark score in the Bollywood history .
The music of the movie shaped the careers of singer Kishore Kumar , lyricist Anand Bakshi , filmmaker Shakti Samanta and R.D. Burman .
For the song Mere Sapno ki raani , Sachin Dev made R.D play the mouth organ .
Dev Anand and S D Burman continued their musical partnership in Prem Pujari .
S D Burman was a frank and outspoken man , with a strong sense of self-pride .
He openly criticised people whom he disliked or whose abilities he suspected .
But he was widely respected by the industry as a cranky genius.There was a time when Lata Mangeshkar refused to sing duets with Mohammed Rafi due to a dispute arising from sharing of royalty , and it was at the insistence of S. D. Burman , the two decided to reconcile , and again sing duets together .
Tere Mere Sapne , Sharmeelee , Abhimaan , Prem Nagar , Sagina , Chupke Chupke , and Mili are other classics from this period .
S D Burman went into a coma soon after rehearsing the song Badi sooni sooni for the film Mili .
He died on 31 October 1975 in Mumbai .
On 1 October 2007 , marking his 101st birth anniversary , India postal department released a commemorative postage stamp , in Agartala , where an exhibition on his life and work was also inaugurated ; the state government of Tripura , also confers the yearly , Sachin Dev Burman Memorial Award in Music .
Sachin Da was the only composer who had used both Kishore and Rafi in almost equal number of songs .
He regarded Kishore as his second son .
Kishore confessed that it was Sachin Da , who had given him the first chance .
Even after the rehearsal of Badi Sooni Sooni from Milli , when Sachin Da had a stroke , Kishore went up to the hospital and said to him that Dada , Please dont worry , your recording is after 3 days , you just see how well it goes .

, and the song is considered as one of the best songs of Kishore Kumar .
Sachin Da also used to telephone Kishore in the dead of night and on the telephone , he would start to sing the new tunes which he composed and ask Kishore to sing with him .
British singer of South Asian heritage , Najma Akhtar , recorded a Shanachie Records CD of Burmans work , Forbidden Kiss : The Music of S.D. Burman , an album of covers of Burman compositions .
The Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar was named after the composer by Sachins grandfather , who was an ardent fan of Burman .
The singer and mimicry artist Sudesh Bhonsle frequently parodies the nasal high-pitched voice and quixotic singing style of S. D. Burman .
Burman paired with tabla maestro late Brajen Biswas for his Bengali songs .
The beats or thekas created by Brajen Babu for these songs are unique and no one in the world can sing these songs in the original thekas .
All the thekas are according to the mood of the songs .
But recently , painter , sculptor and singer Ramita Bhaduri sang the tough songs of Burman like Ami chhinu aka , Rangeela , Aankhi Duti Jhare etc. in the original theka on the taleem of Brajen Biswas .
The CD from Raga Music was released at Kolkata Press Club .
The CDs are available in M. Biswas & Symphony .
Burman had a unique style of composing film songs .
While most of the composers used harmonium or piano to compose the tune , he composed tunes using rhythm such as clapping hands .
He was very fond of Paan and would not share the same with anybody
Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande was an Indian musicologist who wrote the first modern treatise on Hindustani Classical Music , an art which had been propagated earlier for a few centuries mostly through oral traditions .
During those earlier times , the art had undergone several changes , rendering the raga grammar documented in scant old texts outdated .
Ragas used to be classified into Raga , Ragini , and Putra .
Bhatkhande reclassified them into the currently used Thaat system .
He noted that several ragas did not conform to their description in ancient Sanskrit texts .
He explained the ragas in an easy-to-understand language and composed several bandishes which explained the grammar of the ragas .
He borrowed the idea of lakshan geet from the Carnatic music scholar Venkatamakhin .
Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande was born in 1860 , into a Chittapawan Brahmin family in Walkeshwar , Mumbai .
He was educated at Elphinstone College in Mumbai and Deccan College in Pune .
He graduated with a degree in Law in 1885 and joined the legal profession in 1887 .
Later he served a short stint as a lawyer in the High Court in Karachi .
During his college days , Bhatkhande began learning sitar playing from Vallabhdas .
He later learned vocal music from Raojiba , a Dhrupad singer .
He also trained in other aspects of classical music under Belbagkar , Ali Husain Khan , and Vilayat Hussain Khan .
He became a member of Gayan Uttejak Mandali , a musical circle in Mumbai .
Bhatkhande traveled throughout India , meeting with ustads and pandits , and researching music .
He began the study of ancient texts such as the Natya Shastra and Sangeet Ratnakara .
After the death of his wife and his daughter , Bhatkhande abandoned his legal practice and devoted the rest of his life to systematizing the prevailing forms of Hindustani music and building on that system a coordinated theory and practice of music .
During his travels in India , he spent time in Baroda , Gwalior , and Rampur .
In Rampur he was the disciple of legendary Veena Player Ustad Wazir Khan , the descendant of Miyan Tansen .
Bhatkhandes first published work , Swar Malika , was a booklet containing detailed descriptions of all prevalent ragas .
In 1909 , he published Shri Mallakshaya Sangeetam , in Sanskrit , under the pseudonym Chatur-pandit .
To make this cultural heritage accessible to the common man , he published commentary on his own Sanskrit grantha in Marathi over a span of several years ; it was published over four volumes bearing the title : Hindustani Sangeet Paddhati .
These volumes form today the standard text on Hindustani music , an indispensable starting point for any student of Hindustani Classical Music .
His disciple S N Ratanjankar , famous musician Shri .
Dilip Kumar Roy , Ratanjankars disciple K. G. Ginde , S.C.R.Bhatt , Ram Ashrey Jha Ramrang , Sumati Mutatkar and Krishna Kumar Kapoor are among the notable scholars who followed in the footsteps of Bhatkhande .
His notation system became standard and though later scholars like Pt .
V. D. Paluskar , Vinayak Narayan Patwardhan and Pt .
Omkarnath Thakur introduced their improved versions , it remained a publishers favorite .
It suffered a setback with onset of desktop publishing , which found inserting marks above and below Devanagari text cumbersome ; as a result , books carrying compositions yielded to theoretical texts .
A recently developed notation system Ome Swarlipi follows the logical structure introduced by Pt .
Bhatkhande but uses symbols instead of Devanagari alphabets .
After travelling widely and having discussions with practitioners of various schools , Bhatkhande arranged all the ragas of Hindustani classical music across 10 musical scales , called thaats .
Though the thaats do not encompass all possible ragas , they do cover the vast majority , and are a key contribution to Indian musical theory .
The thaat structure corresponds to the melakarta system of raga arrangement in Carnatic music , the south Indian variety of Indian classical music .
Bhatkhande wrote all of his works under one of the two pseudonyms , Vishnu Sharma and Chaturpandit .
Bhatkhande started schools and colleges in India for systematic teaching of Hindustani music .
In 1916 , he reorganized the Baroda state music school , and later , with the help of the Maharaja of Gwalior , established the Madhav Music College in Gwalior .
In 1926 , Rai Umanath Bali and his nephew Dr. Rai Rajeshwar Bali , then education minister of United Provinces , established Marris College of Music in Lucknow , Bhatkhande preparing the course material .
The college was later renamed Bhatkhande College of Hindustani Music , and is now known as Bhatkhande Music Institute .
Preparation of that course material was a landmark achievement of Bhatkhande since musical knowledge used to be passed on orally in earlier times from Gurus and Ustads to their disciples .
Bhatkhande prepared the Hindustani Sangeet Karmik Pustak Malika as a series of textbooks .
He also started the tradition of the All India Music Conferences to provide a common platform for discussion between Hindustani and Carnatic classical musicians .
Bhatkhande suffered paralysis and a thigh fracture in 1933 .
He died in 1936 on Ganesh Chaturthi day .
The Post and Telegraph Department of India paid homage to Bhatkhande by releasing on September 1 , 1961 a commemorative stamp containing his portrait .

Tori Amos is an American pianist , singer-songwriter and composer .
She is a classically trained musician and possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range .
Amos originally served as the lead singer of 1980s synthpop group Y Kant Tori Read , and as a solo artist was at the forefront of a number of female singer-songwriters in the early 1990s .
She was also noteworthy early in her solo career as one of the few alternative rock performers to use a piano as her primary instrument .
Some of her charting singles include Crucify , Silent All These Years , God , Cornflake Girl , Caught a Lite Sneeze , Professional Widow , Spark , 1000 Oceans , and A Sorta Fairytale , her most commercially successful single in the U.S. to date .
As of 2005 , Amos had sold 12 million albums worldwide .
She has been nominated for several awards , including 8 Grammy Award nominations .
Amos is the third child of Rev. Dr. Edison and Mary Ellen Amos .
She was born at the Old Catawba Hospital in Newton , North Carolina , during a trip from their Georgetown home in Washington , D.C. .
Her maternal grandparents were of mixed European and Eastern Cherokee ancestry ; of particular importance to her as a child was her grandfather , Calvin Clinton Copeland , who was a great source of inspiration and guidance , offering a more pantheistic spiritual alternative to her father and paternal grandmothers traditional Christianity .
When she was two , her family moved to Baltimore , Maryland , where she began to play the piano .
By age five , she had begun composing instrumental pieces on piano and , while living in Rockville , Maryland , she won a full scholarship to the Preparatory Division of the Peabody Conservatory of Music .
Her scholarship was discontinued at age 11 and she was asked to leave .
Amos has asserted that she lost the scholarship because of her interest in rock and popular music , coupled with her dislike for reading from sheet music .
In 1972 , the Amos family moved to Silver Spring , Maryland , where her father became pastor of the Good Shepherd United Methodist church .
At the age of 13 she began playing at gay bars and piano bars , chaperoned by her father .
Amos first came to local notice by winning a county teen talent contest in 1977 , singing a song called More Than Just a Friend .
As a senior at Richard Montgomery High School , she co-wrote Baltimore with her brother Mike Amos for a competition involving the Baltimore Orioles .
The song won the contest and became her first single , released as a 7 single pressed locally for family and friends during 1980 with another Amos-penned composition as a B-side , Walking With You .
Before this she performed under her middle name , Ellen , but permanently adopted Tori after a friends boyfriend told her it suited her .
At age 21 , Amos moved to Los Angeles to pursue her music career after several years performing on the piano bar circuit of the D.C. area .
In 1986 , Amos formed a music group , Y Kant Tori Read , the name of which was a reference to her days at the Peabody Conservatory , where she was able to play songs on her piano by ear , but was never successful at sight reading .
In addition to Amos , the group was composed of Steve Caton , drummer Matt Sorum , bass player Brad Cobb and , for a short time , keyboardist Jim Tauber .
Following several phases of writing and recording , during which Amos has since asserted that the band lost their musical edge and direction due to interference from record executives , in July 1988 , the Y Kant Tori Read s self-titled debut album was released .
Although its producer , Joe Chiccarelli , has stated that Amos was very happy with the album at the time , it is now out of print and Amos has expressed no interest in reissuing it .
Following the albums commercial failure and the groups subsequent disbanding , Amos began working with other artists as a backup vocalist .
She also recorded a song called Distant Storm for the film China OBrien ; in the credits , the song is attributed to a band called Tess Makes Good .
It was the only song recorded by the band , and its only commercial release was in the film .
Despite the disappointing reaction to Y Kant Tori Read , Amos still had to comply with her six-record contract with Atlantic Records , who in 1989 wanted a new record by March 1990 .
The initial recordings were declined by the label , which Amos felt was because the album had not been properly presented .
The album was reworked and expanded under the guidance of Doug Morris and the musical talents of Steve Caton , Eric Rosse , Will MacGregor , Carlo Nuccio , and Dan Nebenzal , resulting in Little Earthquakes , an album recounting her religious upbringing , sexual awakening , struggle to establish her identity , and sexual assault .
This album became her commercial and artistic breakthrough .
Amos traveled to New Mexico with personal and professional partner Eric Rosse in 1993 to write and largely record her second solo record , Under the Pink .
The album was received with mostly favorable reviews and sold enough copies to chart at No. 12 on the Billboard 200 , a significantly higher position than the preceding albums position at No. 54 on the same chart .
Her third solo album , Boys for Pele , was released in January 1996 .
The album was recorded in an Irish church , in Delgany , County Wicklow , with Amos taking advantage of the church recording setting to create an album ripe with baroque influences , lending it a darker sound and style .
She added harpsichord , harmonium , and clavichord to her keyboard repertoire , and also included such anomalies as a gospel choir , bagpipes , church bells , and drum programming .
The album garnered mixed reviews upon its release , with some critics praising its intensity and uniqueness while others bemoaned its comparative impenetrability .
Despite the albums erratic lyrical content and instrumentation , the latter of which kept it away from mainstream audiences , Boys for Pele is Amoss most successful simultaneous transatlantic release , reaching No. 2 on both the Billboard 200 and the UK Top 40 upon its release at the height of her fame .
Fueled by the desire to have her own recording studio to distance herself from record company executives , Amos had the barn of her home in Cornwall converted into a state-of-the-art recording studio , Martian Engineering Studios .
From the Choirgirl Hotel and To Venus and Back , released in May 1998 and September 1999 , respectively , differ greatly from previous albums as Amoss trademark acoustic piano-based sound is largely replaced with arrangements that include elements of electronica , dance music , vocal washes and sonic landscapes .
The underlying themes of both albums deal with womanhood , and Amoss own miscarriages and marriage .
Reviews for From the Choirgirl Hotel were mostly favorable and praised Amoss continued artistic originality .
While not her highest chart debut , debut sales for From the Choirgirl Hotel are Amoss best to date , selling 153,000 copies in its first week .
To Venus and Back , a two-disc release of original studio material and live material recorded from the previous world tour , received mostly positive reviews and included the first major-label single available for sale as a digital download .
Motherhood inspired Amos to produce a cover album , recording songs written by men about women and reversing the gender roles to show a womans perspective .
That idea grew into Strange Little Girls , released in September 2001 , one year after giving birth to her daughter .
The album is Amoss first concept album , with artwork featuring Amos photographed in character of the women portrayed in each song .
Amos would later reveal that a stimulus for the album was to end her contract with Atlantic without giving them new original songs ; Amos felt that since 1998 , the label had not been properly promoting her and had trapped her in a contract by refusing to sell her to another label .
With her Atlantic contract fulfilled after a 15-year stint , Amos signed to Epic in late 2001 .
In October 2002 , Amos released Scarlets Walk , another concept album .
Described as a sonic novel , the album explores Amoss alter ego , Scarlet , intertwined with her cross-country concert tour following 9/11 .
Through the songs , Amos explores such topics as the history of America , American people , Native American history , pornography , masochism , homophobia and misogyny .
The album had a strong debut , demonstrating that Amoss fan base remained intact through the label change .
However , Scarlets Walk is Amoss last album to date to reach certified gold status from the RIAA .
Not long after Amos was ensconced with her new label , she received unsettling news when Polly Anthony resigned as president of Epic Records in 2003 .
Anthony had been one of the primary reasons Amos signed with the label and as a result of her resignation , Amos formed the Bridge Entertainment Group .
Further trouble for Amos occurred the following year when her label , Epic/Sony Music Entertainment , merged with BMG Entertainment as a result of the industrys decline .
Amos would later hint in interviews that during the creation of her next album , those in charge at the label following the aforementioned merger were interested only in making money , the effects of which on the album have not been disclosed .
Amos released two more albums with the label , The Beekeeper and American Doll Posse .
Both albums received mixed reviews , some of which stated that the albums suffered from being too long .
The Beekeeper was conceptually influenced by the ancient art of beekeeping , which she considered a source of female inspiration and empowerment .
Through extensive study , Amos also wove in the stories of the Gnostic gospels and the removal of women from a position of power within the Christian church to create an album based largely on religion and politics .
The album debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 , placing her in an elite group of women who have secured five or more US Top 10 album debuts .
While the newly merged label was present throughout the production process of The Beekeeper , Amos and her crew nearly completed her next project , American Doll Posse , before inviting the label to listen to it .
American Doll Posse , another concept album , is fashioned around a group of girls who are used as a theme of alter-egos of Amoss .
Musically and stylistically , the album saw Amos return to a more confrontational nature .
Like its predecessor , American Doll Posse debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 .
During her tenure with Epic Records , Amos also released a retrospective collection titled Tales of a Librarian through her former label , Atlantic Records ; a two-disc DVD set Fade to Red containing most of Amoss solo music videos , released through the Warner Bros. reissue imprint Rhino ; a five disc box set titled , celebrating Amoss 15-year solo career through remastered album tracks , remixes , alternate mixes , demos , and a string of unreleased songs from album recording sessions , also released through Rhino ; and numerous official bootlegs from two world tours , The Original Bootlegs and Legs & Boots through Epic Records .
In May 2008 , Amos announced that , due to creative and financial disagreements with Epic Records , she had negotiated an end to her contract with the record label , and would be operating independently of major record labels on future work .
In September of the same year , Amos released a live album and DVD , Live at Montreux 1991/1992 , through Eagle Rock Entertainment , of two performances she gave at the Montreux Jazz Festival very early on in her career while promoting her debut solo album , Little Earthquakes .
By December , after a chance encounter with chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group , Doug Morris , Amos signed a joint venture deal with Universal Republic Records .
Abnormally Attracted to Sin , Amoss tenth solo studio album and her first album released through Universal Republic , was released in May 2009 to mostly positive reviews .
The album debuted in the top 10 of the Billboard 200 , making it Amoss seventh album to do so .
Abnormally Attracted to Sin , admitted Amos , is a personal album , not a conceptual one , with the album exploring themes of power , boundaries , and the subjective view of sin .
Continuing her distribution deal with Universal Republic , Amos released Midwinter Graces , her first seasonal album , in November of the same year .
The album features reworked versions of traditional carols , as well as original songs written by Amos .
During her contract with the label , Amos recorded vocals for two songs for David Byrnes collaboration album with Fatboy Slim , entitled Here Lies Love , which was released in April 2010 .
In July of the same year , the DVD Tori Amos - Live from the Artists Den was released exclusively through Barnes & Noble .
After a brief tour from June to September 2010 , Amos released the highly exclusive live album From Russia With Love in December the same year , recorded live in Moscow on September 3 , 2010 .
The limited edition set included a signature edition Lomography Diana F + camera , along with 2 lenses , a roll of film and 1 of 5 photographs taken of Tori during her time in Moscow .
The set was released exclusively through toriamos.com and only 2000 copies were produced .
In September 2011 , Amos released her first classical music album , Night of Hunters , featuring variations on a theme to pay tribute to such renowned composers as Bach , Chopin , Debussy , Granados , Satie and Schubert , through the Deutsche Grammophon label , a division of Universal Music Group .
Amos recorded the album with several musicians , including the Apollon Musagete string quartet .
To mark the 20th anniversary of her debut album Little Earthquakes , Amos released an album of songs from her back catalogue re-worked and re-recorded with the Metropole Orchestra .
The album , titled Gold Dust , was released in October 2012 through Deutsche Grammophon .
On May 1 , 2012 , Amos announced the formation of her own record label Transmission Galactic , which she intends to use to develop new artists .
One of the first artists signed is singer/songwriter , Lawrence Casey .
In 2013 , Amos collaborated with The Bullitts on the track Wait Until Tomorrow from their debut album They Die by Dawn & Other Short Stories .
She has also stated in an interview that a new album and tour will materialize in 2014 and that it will be a return to contemporary music .
September 2013 saw the launch of Tori Amos much anticipated musical project adaptation , George MacDonald s The Light Princess , along with book writer Samuel Adamson and Marianne Elliott .
It premiered at Londons Royal National Theatre and will run until February 2014 .
The Light Princess and its lead actress Rosalie Craig were nominated for Best Musical and Best Musical Performance , respectively , at the prestigious Evening Standard Award .
Rosalie Craig won the Best Musical Performance category .
On November 25 , 2013 , it was announced that Tori Amos 14th studio album album is entitled Unrepentant Geraldines .

In 2011 Adrienne Trier-Bieniek , a sociology graduate student at Western Michigan University , received her PhD for a dissertation entitled All I Am : Defining Music as an Emotional Catalyst through a Sociological Study of Emotions , Gender and Culture .
Trier-Bieniek focused on Amoss female fans and the emotional support they receive from listening to Amoss music .
Along with Patricia Leavy , Trier-Bieniek contributed a chapter to the book The Art of Social Critique which addressed Amoss later albums and songwriting skills .
Sing Us a Song , Piano Woman : Female Fans and the Music of Tori Amos by Adrienne Trier-Bieniek detailed Trier-Bienieks research with women who have used Tori Amoss music as a means to heal from trauma .
It also discusses the feminist themes in Tori Amoss songwriting/persona .
Early in her professional career , Amos befriended author Neil Gaiman , who became a fan after she referenced him in the song Tear in Your Hand and also in print interviews .
Although created before the two met , the character Delirium from Gaimans The Sandman series is inspired by Amos ; Gaiman has stated that they steal shamelessly from each other .
She wrote the foreword to his collection ; he in turn wrote the introduction to Comic Book Tattoo .
Gaiman is godfather to her daughter and a poem written for her birth , Blueberry Girl , was published as a childrens book of the same name in 2009 .
Amos married English sound engineer Mark Hawley on February 22 , 1998 .
Their only child , a daughter named Natashya Tash Lorien Hawley , was born on September 5 , 2000 , a few weeks after Toris 37th birthday .
The family divides their time between Sewalls Point in Florida , Kinsale in Ireland , and Cornwall in England .

The Sounds of India is a 1968 LP album by Hindustani classical musician Ravi Shankar .
It was digitally remastered and released in CD format by Columbia Records in 1989 .
Allmusic reviewer Adam Greenberg recommended listening to the album for Shankars amazing abilities but singled out the album for its historic value as a work that introduced Western listeners to Hindustani classical music using short lessons before each performance
Ram Narayan , often referred to with the title Pandit , is an Indian musician who popularised the bowed instrument sarangi as a solo concert instrument in Hindustani classical music and became the first internationally successful sarangi player .
Narayan was born near Udaipur and learned to play the sarangi at an early age .
He studied under sarangi players and singers and , as a teenager , worked as a music teacher and traveling musician .
All India Radio , Lahore , hired Narayan as an accompanist for vocalists in 1944 .
He moved to Delhi following the partition of India in 1947 , but wishing to go beyond accompaniment and frustrated with his supporting role , Narayan moved to Mumbai in 1949 to work in Indian cinema .
After an unsuccessful attempt in 1954 , Narayan became a concert solo artist in 1956 , and later gave up accompaniment .
He recorded solo albums and began to tour America and Europe in the 1960s .
Narayan taught Indian and foreign students and performed , frequently outside of India , into the 2000s .
He was awarded Indias second highest civilian honour , the Padma Vibhushan , in 2005 .
Ram Narayan was born on 25 December 1927 in Amber village , near Udaipur in northwestern India .
His great-great-grandfather , Bagaji Biyavat , was a singer from Amber , and he and Narayans great-grandfather , Sagad Danji Biyavat , sang at the court of the Maharana of Udaipur .
Narayans grandfather , Har Lalji Biyavat , and father , Nathuji Biyavat , were farmers and singers , Nathuji played the bowed instrument dilruba , and Narayans mother was a music lover .
Narayans first language was Rajasthani and he learned Hindi and , later , English .
At an age of about six , he found a small sarangi left by the familys Ganga guru , a genealogist , and was taught a fingering technique developed by his father .
Narayans father taught him , but was worried about the difficulty of playing the sarangi and its association with courtesan music , which gave the instrument a low social status .
After a year , Biyavat sought lessons for his son from sarangi player Mehboob Khan of Jaipur , but changed his mind when Khan told him Narayan would have to change his fingering technique .
Narayans father later encouraged him to leave school and devote himself to playing the sarangi .
At about ten years of age , Narayan learned the basics of dhrupad , the oldest genre of Hindustani classical music , by studying and imitating the practice of sarangi player Uday Lal of Udaipur , a student of dhrupad singers Allabande and Zakiruddin Dagar .
After Uday Lal died of old age , Narayan met traveling singer Madhav Prasad , originally of Lucknow , who had performed at the court of Maihar .
With Prasad , Narayan enacted the ganda bandhan , a traditional ceremony of acceptance between a teacher and his pupil , in which Narayan swore obedience in exchange for being maintained by Prasad .
He served Prasad and was taught in khyal , the predominate genre of Hindustani classical music , but returned to Udaipur after four years to teach music school .
Prasad later visited Narayan and convinced him to resign his position and dedicate his time to improvement as a musician , although the idea of giving up a steady life was not well received by Narayans family .
He stayed with Prasad and travelled to several Indian states until Prasad fell ill and advised him to learn from singer Abdul Wahid Khan in Lahore .
Following Prasads death in Lucknow , Narayan enacted the ganda bandhan with another teacher who gave him lessons , but soon left for Lahore and never performed the ritual again .
Narayan travelled to Lahore in 1943 and auditioned for the local All India Radio station as a singer , but the stations music producer , Jivan Lal Mattoo , noticed grooves in Narayans fingernails : sarangis are played by pressing the fingernails sideways against three playing strings , which strains the nails .
Mattoo instead employed Narayan as a sarangi player .
Traditionally , the sarangi is supposed to play after the singer and imitate the vocal performance , and play in the space between phrases .
Mattoo advised Narayan and helped him contact khyal singer Abdul Wahid Khan , a rigorous teacher under whom Narayan learned four ragas through singing lessons .
Narayan was allowed sporadic solo performances on AIR and began to consider a solo career .
After the partition of India in 1947 , Narayan moved to Delhi and played at the local AIR station .
His work for popular singers increased his repertoire and knowledge of styles .
Narayan played with the classical singers Omkarnath Thakur , Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , Hirabai Badodekar , and Krishnarao Shankar Pandit , and he accompanied singer Amir Khan in 1948 , when Khan sang for the first time at AIR Delhi following the partition .
As an accompanist for vocalists , Narayan showed his own talent and came to the foreground .
Singers of the city complained that he was not a dependable accompanist and too assertive , but he maintained he wanted to keep vocalists in tune and inspire them in a cordial contest .
Other tabla players and singers , including Omkarnath Thakur and Krishnarao Shankar Pandit , expressed admiration for Narayans playing .
Narayan became frustrated with his supporting role for vocalists and moved to Mumbai in 1949 to work independently in film music and recording .
He recorded three solo 78 rpm gramophone records for the British HMV Group in 1950 and an early ten-inch LP album in Mumbai in 1951 , but the album was not in demand .
The Mumbai film industry offered a good salary and obscurity for work that would have lowered his stature among classical musicians .
For the next 15 years he played and composed songs for films , including Adalat , Gunga Jumna , Humdard , Kashmir Ki Kali , Milan , Mughal-e-Azam , and Noorjehan .
He was considered a desired choice of film music director O. P. Nayyar .
Narayan performed in Afghanistan in 1952 and in China in 1954 and was well received in both countries .
His first solo concert at a 1954 music festival in the Cowasji Jehangir Hall , Mumbai , was cut short when an impatient audience , waiting for performances by famous artists , drove him from the stage .
Narayan pondered giving up the sarangi and becoming a singer .
He later regained confidence , performed solo for smaller crowds , and was favourably received in his second attempt to play solo for a Mumbai music festival in 1956 .
He has since performed at the major music festivals of India .
Narayan later gave up accompaniment ; this decision carried a financial risk because interest in solo sarangi was not yet substantial .
After sitar player Ravi Shankar successfully performed in Western countries , Narayan followed his example .
He recorded solo albums and made his first international tour in 1964 to America and Europe with his older brother Chatur Lal , a tabla player who had toured with Shankar in the 1950s .
The European tour included performances in France , Germany , sponsored by the Goethe-Institut , and at the City of London Festival , England .
Beginning in the 1960s , Narayan often taught and gave concerts outside of India .
On his Western tours he encountered interest in the sarangi because of its similarity to cello and violin .
The tabla player Suresh Talwalkar became a frequent accompanist for Narayan in the late 1960s .
Narayan continued to perform and record in India and abroad for the next decades and his recordings appeared on Indian , American , and European labels .
During the early 1980s he typically spent months each year visiting Western nations .
Narayan performed less frequently in the 2000s and rarely in the 2010s .
Narayans style is characteristic of Hindustani classical music , but his choice of solo instrument and his background of learning from teachers outside his community are not common for the genre .
He has stated that he aims to please the audience and create a feeling of harmony , and expects the audience to reciprocate by reacting to his playing .
Narayans performances are strung together from the meditative and measured alap and jor in dhrupad style , followed by a faster and less reserved gat section in khyal style .
He experimented with a style of jhala developed by Bundu Khan , but considered it more appropriate for plucked instruments and stopped performing it .
The gat section includes one or two parts with compositions .
When two gats are used , the first one tends to be at a slow or medium tempo , and the second one is faster ; the gats are usually performed in the 16-beat rhythmic cycle tintal .
Narayan often completes performances with ragas associated with thumri , which are referred to as mishra because they allow for additional notes , or with a dhun .
Narayan practices and teaches using a limited number of paltas , exercises in a small scale range that are used to prepare playing different numbers of notes per bow .
Derived from paltas are lengthy note patterns called tans , which contain characteristic melodic shapes and are used by Narayan for fast playing .
He uses his left hand for runs and to play an extended melodic range , and his right hand for rhythmic accentuations .
Narayans fingering technique , his low right hand position , keeping the bow in a close to right angle to the string , and his use of the full bow length are unusual among sarangi players .
Narayan is associated with the Kirana gharana through Abdul Wahid Khan , but his performance style is not strongly connected to it .
Most of Narayans compositions are from the singing repertoire of his teachers and were modified and adapted to the sarangi .
He has created original compositions and in performance varies those he was taught .
Narayan disfavors the creation of new ragas , but developed compound ragas , including those of Nand with Kedar and Kafi with Malhar .
Narayan uses a sarangi obtained from Uday Lal and built in Meerut in the 1920s or 1930s in his concerts and recordings .
He plays on foreign harp strings to produce a clearer tone .
Narayan experimented with modifications to his instrument and added a fourth string , but removed it because it hindered playing .
In the 1940s , he exchanged gut with steel for the first string and found it easier to play , but reverted to using only gut strings because the steel string altered the sound .
Narayan increased the status of the sarangi to that of a modern concert solo instrument , made it known outside of India , and was the first sarangi player with international success , an example later followed by Sultan Khan .
Narayans simplified fingering technique allows for glide and affected the modern sarangi concert style , as aspects of his playing and tone creation were taken up by sarangi players from Narayans recordings .
Narayan taught at the American Society for Eastern Arts and the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Mumbai in the 1970s and 1980s , where he gave the first master class for sarangi .
Narayan privately trained sarangi players , including his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle , his grandson Harsh Narayan , and Vasanti Srikhande .
He also taught sarod players , including his son Brij Narayan , as well as vocalists and a violinist .
In 2002 , he taught 15 Indian students and more than 500 students in the United States and Europe had studied with him .
Indian music in performance : a practical introduction , released in 1980 by Neil Sorrell in cooperation with Narayan , was described as one of the best presentations on modern North Indian music practice by Hans Neuhoff in Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart .
Narayan argued that appreciation of the sarangi and him came only after acknowledgment by the Western audience .
He attributed the lack of sarangi students to a lack of competent teachers and said that the Indian government should assist in preserving the instrument .
The Pt Ram Narayan Foundation in Mumbai awards scholarships to sarangi students , but Narayan stated he was skeptical the sarangi would survive .
Narayan received the national awards Padma Shri in 1976 , Padma Bhushan in 1991 , and Padma Vibhushan in 2005 .
The Padma Vibhushan , Indias second highest civilian honor , was presented by Indian President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam .
Narayan was awarded the Rajasthan Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for 1974-75 , the national Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for 1975 , and was made a fellow of the Rajasthan Sangeet Natak Akademi for 1988-89 .
He received the Kalidas Samman from the Government of Madhya Pradesh for 1991-92 and was presented with the Aditya Vikram Birla Kalashikhar Puraskar in 1999 by P. C. Alexander , governor of Maharashtra .
He also received the Maharashtra Gaurav Puraskar , the Shiromani Award , the Rajasthan Welfare Association Award , and in 2013 the Rajasthan Ratna .
The biographical film Pandit Ramnarayan - Sarangi Ke Sang was shown at the 2007 International Film Festival of India .
Narayan shared a close relationship with his older brother , Chatur Lal , who learned the tabla primarily to accompany his brothers sarangi playing .
Lal studied under tabla teachers in his youth , but later turned to farming .
Lal visited Narayan 1948 in Delhi after Narayan had become a professional sarangi player , and Narayan convinced Lal to work as a tabla player at the local AIR station .
Lal became an acclaimed musician , toured with instrumentalists Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan in the 1950s , and helped popularize the tabla in Western countries .
When Lal died in October 1965 , Narayan had difficulty performing and struggled with alcoholism , but overcame the addiction after two years .
Narayan assisted his brothers four children after their fathers death .
Chatur Lals son , Charanjit Lal Biyavat , is a tabla player and has toured Europe with Narayan .
Narayans wife Sheela , a homemaker , came to Mumbai in the 1950s and they had four children .
She died prior to 2001 .
His oldest son , sarod player Brij Narayan , was born on 25 April 1952 in Udaipur , and his daughter Aruna Narayan was born in 1959 in Mumbai .
She was the first woman to give a solo sarangi concert and immigrated to Canada in 1984 .
Another son , Shiv , who is a year younger than Aruna , has learned to play the tabla , and toured Australia with his father .
Brij Narayans son , Harsh Narayan , plays the sarangi .
In 2009 , Narayan performed at BBC s The Proms in the Royal Albert Hall , London , with Aruna , and he played at the 2010 Sawai Gandharva Music Festival , Pune , with Harsh .

Lowell George was born in Hollywood , California , the son of Willard H. George , a furrier who raised chinchillas and supplied furs to the movie studios .
Georges first instrument was the harmonica .
At the age of 6 he appeared on Ted Macks Original Amateur Hour performing a duet with his older brother , Hampton .
As a student at Hollywood High School , he took up the flute in the school marching band and orchestra .
He had already started to play Hamptons acoustic guitar at age 11 , progressed to the electric guitar by his high school years , and later learned to play the saxophone , shakuhachi and sitar .
During this period , George viewed the teen idol - oriented rock and roll of the era in a contemptuous light , instead favoring West Coast jazz and the soul jazz of Les McCann & Mose Allison .
Following graduation in 1963 , he briefly worked at a gas station to support himself while studying art and art history at Los Angeles Valley College for two years .
Initially funded by the sale of his grandfathers stock , Georges first band formed in 1965 and released at least one single on the Uni label , Smile , Let Your Life Begin .
Members included future Little Feat drummer Richie Hayward , Martin Kibbee who would later co-write several Little Feat songs with George , and Warren Klein on guitar .
Frank Zappa produced two tracks for the band , but they werent released until 1993 on the album Lightning-Rod Man , billed as Lowell George and The Factory .
The band made an appearance on the 1960s sitcom F Troop as The Bed Bugs .
They were also featured in an episode of Gomer Pyle , U.S.M.C. , Lost , the Colonels Daughter .
Although not visible in the scene inside the A Go-Go club , their music can be heard playing loudly .

Following the disbanding of The Factory , George briefly joined The Standells .
In November 1968 , George joined Zappas Mothers of Invention as rhythm guitarist and nominal lead vocalist ; he can be heard on both Weasels Ripped My Flesh and the first disc of You Cant Do That on Stage Anymore , Vol .
5 .
During this period , he would absorb Zappas autocratic leadership style and avant garde - influenced conceptual/procedural-oriented compositional methods .
He earned his first production credit on Permanent Damage , an album recorded by groupie group The GTOs .
George later asserted that he performed no real function in the band and left the group in May 1969 under nebulous circumstances .
GTOs member Pamela Des Barres has claimed that George was fired by the abstemious Zappa for smoking marijuana , while he claimed at a 1975 Little Feat concert that he was fired because he wrote a song about dope .
On the contrary , biographer Mark Brend asserts that Zappa liked the song but thought there was no place for it in the Mothers set ; George himself alternatively claimed that it was decided that I should leave and form a band by mutual agreement .
After leaving the Mothers of Invention , George invited fellow musicians to form a new band , which they named Little Feat .
George usually played lead guitar and focused on slide guitar .
Ry Cooder played the slide on the debut Little Feat album after George badly injured his hand while working on a powered model airplane , although George re-recorded some of his material .
Mark Brend wrote that Georges use of compression defined his sound and gave him the means to play his extended melodic lines .
When not working with Little Feat , George lent his talents as a session player .
George played guitar on John Cale s 1973 album Paris 1919 , Harry Nilsson s Son of Schmilsson album and The Meters Just Kissed My Baby in 1974 , and on John Sebastian s Tarzana Kid .
In 1976 he played on Jackson Browne s The Pretender .
Also with The Meters , Georges slide work features prominently on Robert Palmers first solo studio album , Sneakin Sally Through the Alley recorded in New Orleans , Louisiana in 1974 .
In the 1970s , Little Feat released a stream of studio albums : Little Feat , Sailin Shoes , Dixie Chicken , Feats Dont Fail Me Now , The Last Record Album , and Time Loves A Hero .
The groups 1978 live album Waiting for Columbus became their best-selling album .
In an interview with Bill Flanagan conducted eleven days before his death , George stated that he was keen to re-form Little Feat without Bill Payne and Paul Barrere in order to reassert his full control over the group .
Due to tensions within the group , especially between George and Payne and , to a lesser extent , Barrere , regarding musical direction and leadership , Payne and Barrere left the group in 1979 .
George was also a producer , and produced the Grateful Dead s 1978 album Shakedown Street , as well as Little Feats records , Valerie Carter s 1977 release Just A Stones Throw Away , and Georges 1979 solo album Thanks , Ill Eat It Here .
On June 15 , 1979 , George began a tour in support of his solo album .
On June 29 , 1979 , the morning after an appearance at Washington , D.C. s Lisner Auditorium where the bulk of Waiting for Columbus had been recorded , George collapsed and died in his Arlington , Virginia hotel room .
A postmortem report later stated that heart failure was the cause of death .
Georges body was cremated in Washington , D.C. on August 2 .

Ustad Amir Khan was a well-known Indian classical vocalist .
He is considered one of the most influential figures in Hindustani classical music , and the founder of the Indore Gharana .
Amir Khan was born in a family of musicians in Indore , India .
His father , Shahmir Khan , a sarangi and veena player of the Bhendibazaar gharana , served at the court of the Holkars of Indore .
His grandfather , Change Khan , was a singer in the court of Bahadurshah Zafar .
Amir Alis mother died when he was nine years old .
He had a younger brother , Bashir , who became a sarangi player at the Indore station of All India Radio .
He was initially trained in the sarangi by his father .
However , seeing his interest in vocal music , his father gradually devoted more time to vocal training , focusing on the Merukhand technique .
Amir Ali was exposed at an early age to many different styles , since just about every musician who visited Indore would come to their house , and there would be mehfils at their place on a regular basis .
Also , he learnt the basics of tabla playing from one of his maternal uncles , who was a tabla player .
Amir Khan moved to Bombay in 1934 , and there he gave a few concerts and cut about half a dozen 78-rpm records .
These initial performances were not well received .
Following his fathers advice , in 1936 he joined the services of Maharaj Chakradhar Singh of Raigadh Sansthan in Madhya Pradesh , but he stayed only about a year .
Amir Khans father died in 1937 .
Later , Khansahib lived for some time in Delhi and Calcutta , but after the partition of India he moved back to Bombay .
Amir Khan developed his own singing style , influenced by the styles of Abdul Waheed Khan , Rajab Ali Khan and Aman Ali Khan .
This unique style , known as the Indore Gharana , blends the spiritual flavor and grandeur of dhrupad with the ornate vividness of khyal .
He presented an aesthetically detailed badhat in ati-vilambit laya using bol-alap , followed by gradually speeding up sargams with various ornamentations , taans and bol-taans , including Merukhandi patterns , and finally a madhyalaya or drut laya chhota khyal or a rubaidar tarana .
While he was famous for his use of merukhand , he did not do a purely merukhandi alap but rather inserted merukhandi passages throughout his performance .
He often used the taals Jhoomra and Ektaal , and generally preferred a simple theka from the tabla accompanist .
He could do layakari , including bol-baant , which he has demonstrated in a few recordings , but he generally favored a swara-oriented and alap-dominated style .
He had a rich baritone voice with a three-octave range .
His performances had an understated elegance , reverence , restrained passion and an utter lack of showmanship that both moved and awed listeners .
According to Mohan Nadkarnis book Great Masters : Profiles in Hindustani Classical Vocal Music , Bade Ghulam Ali Khan s music was extroverted and exuberant , whereas Amir Khans was an introverted , dignified darbar style .
Amir Khansahib believed that poetry was important in khyal compositions , and with his pen name , Sur Rang , he has left several compositions .
Amir Khan helped popularize the tarana , as well as khyalnuma compositions in Persian .
As in the case of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , Amir Khans initial sarangi training was important in establishing him as a great singer .
Even though he had been trained in the sarangi , he generally performed khyals and taranas with only a tanpura and tabla for accompaniment .
Sometimes he had a subdued harmonium accompaniment , but he almost never used the sarangi .
Besides singing in concerts , Amir Khan also sang film songs in ragas , in a purely classical style , most notably for the films Baiju Bawra , Kshudhita Pashan , Shabaab , and Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje .
This attempt to introduce classical music to the masses through films significantly boosted Khansahibs visibility and popularity .
He also sang a ghazal Rahiye Ab Aisi Jagah for a documentary on Ghalib .
Khansahibs disciples include Amarnath , A. Kanan , Ajit Singh Paintal , Akhtar Sadmani , Amarjeet Kaur , Bhimsen Sharma , Gajendra Bakshi , Hridaynath Mangeshkar , Kamal Bose , Kankana Banerjee , Mukund Goswami , Munir Khan , Pradyumna Kumud Mukherjee and Poorabi Mukherjee , Shankar Mazumdar , Singh Brothers , and Srikant Bakre .
His style has also influenced many other singers and instrumentalists , including Bhimsen Joshi , Gokulotsavji Maharaj , Mahendra Toke , Prabha Atre , Rashid Khan , Rasiklal Andharia , Shanti Sharma , Nikhil Banerjee and the Imdadkhani gharana .
Although he referred to his style as the Indore Gharana , he was a firm believer of absorbing elements from various gharanas .
Amir Khan was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1967 and the Padma Bhushan in 1971 .
Amir Khans first marriage was to Zeenat , sister of the sitar player , Ustad Vilayat Khan .
From this marriage , which eventually failed and ended in separation , he had a daughter , Farida .
His second marriage was to Munni Bai , who gave birth to a son , Ekram Ahmed .
Around 1965 , Khansaheb married Raisa Begum , daughter of the thumri singer , Mushtari Begum of Agra .
He had expected that Munni Begum would accept the third wife ; however , Munni disappeared and it is rumored that she committed suicide .
With Raisa he had a son , Haider Amir , later called Shahbaz Khan .
Khansahib died a premature death in a car accident in Calcutta , and was buried at Calcuttas Gobra cemetery

Bismillah Khan , often referred to by the honorific title Ustad , was an Indian musician credited with popularising the shehnai , a subcontinental wind instrument of the oboe class .
While the shehnai had long held importance as a folk instrument played primarily during traditional ceremonies , Khan is credited with elevating its status and bringing it to the concert stage .
He was awarded India 's highest civilian honour , the Bharat Ratna , in 2001 , becoming the Third classical musician after M. S. Subbulakshmi and Ravi Shankar to be accorded this distinction .
Bismillah Khan was born on 21 March 1913 in Dumraon , Bihar in northern India .
He was the second son of Paigambar Khan and Mitthan .
His parents had initially named him Qamaruddin to rhyme with their first-born son Shamshuddin .
However , his grandfather , Rasool Bux Khan , the shehnai master of the court of Bhojpur , exclaimed Bismillah !
at the sight of him and thereafter he came to be known by this name .
His ancestors were court musicians and used to play in Naqqar khana in the princely states of Bhojpur , now in Bihar .
His father was a shehnai player in the court of Maharaja Keshav Prasad Singh of Dumraon Estate , Bihar .
At the age of six , he moved to Varanasi .
He received his training under his uncle , the late Ali Baksh Vilayatu , a shehnai player attached to Varanasis Vishwanath Temple .
Though a pious Shiite Muslim , he was also , like many Indian musicians , regardless of religion , a devotee of Saraswati , the Hindu Goddess of wisdom and arts , and often played at Hindu temples , including the famous Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi , on the banks of the river Ganga .
He also performed for spiritual master Prem Rawat .
Bismillah Khan was perhaps single-handedly responsible for making the shehnai a famous classical instrument .
He brought the shehnai to the center stage of Indian music with his concert in the Calcutta All India Music Conference in 1937 .
He was credited with having almost monopoly over the instrument as he and the shehnai are almost synonyms .
Khan is one of the finest musicians in post-independent Indian classical music and one of the best examples of Hindu-Muslim unity in India .
He played shehnai to audience across the world .
He was known to be so devoted to his art form that he referred to shehnai as his begum after his wife died .
On his death , as an honour , his shehnai was buried with him .
He was known for his vision of spreading peace and love through music .
Khan had the rare honor of performing at Delhis Red Fort on the eve of Indias Independence in 1947 .
He also performed raga Kafi from the Red Fort on the eve of India 's first Republic Day ceremony , on January 26 , 1950 .
His recital had become a cultural part of Indias Independence Day celebrations , telecast on Doordarshan every year on August 15 .
After the prime ministers speech from Lal Qila in Old Delhi , Doordarshan would broadcast a live performance by the shehnai maestro .
This tradition dated from the days of Pandit Nehru .
Khan had a brief association with movies .
He played the shehnai for Rajkumar s role of Appanna in the Kannada movie Sanaadi Appanna .
He acted in Jalsaghar , a movie by Satyajit Ray and provided sound of shehnai in Goonj Uthi Shehnai .
Noted director Goutam Ghose directed Sange Meel Se Mulaqat , a documentary about the life of Khan .
In the 1967 film The Graduate , there is a poster advertising Bismillah Khan and the seven musicians on a busy street of Berkeley , California .
He thought that if he would be able to share his knowledge it would not be so useful as it gives them a little knowledge .
On August 17 , 2006 , Khan was taken ill and admitted to the Heritage Hospital , Varanasi for treatment .
He died after four days on August 21 , 2006 due to a cardiac arrest .
He is survived by five daughters , three sons and a large number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren , and his adopted daughter Dr Soma Ghosh .
The Government of India declared a day of national mourning on his death .
His body along with a Shehnai was buried at Fatemain burial ground of old Varanasi under a neem tree with 21-gun salute from Indian Army .
Sangeet Natak Akademi , New Delhi , instituted the Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar in 2007 , in his honour .

Lucknow gharana , also known as Purab Gharana , is one of the six main gharanas or styles in tabla .
It is characterized by the full usage of the palm besides the fingers , resonant sounds , and the use of ring and little fingers on the Dayan .
The Gharana branched out of the Delhi gharana when the two brothers Modu and Bakshu Khan , the third generation of the lineage of Delhis Mia Siddhar Khan , moved to Lukhnow , due to political disturbances in Delhi , while one brother Makkhu Khan stayed on in Delhi .
In Lucknow , the Nawabs mainly patronised Kathak , a classical dance form of the North accompanied by the pakhavaj , the still living ancestor of tabla .
Modu and Bakshu Khan collaborated with the performers of these arts and ended up in creating a unique style of tabla playing adapted from Kathak and pakhavaj compositions , the style now being termed as Khula Baaj or Hatheli ka Baaj .
Among these upgrades , Gat and Paran are two types of compositions that are very common in Lucknow gharana .
Lucknow style has also conceived its very own item , known as Raon : it consists of extremely fast , delicate and colourful fillings within broad and bold rhythmic designs working as a framework .
Prominent names in this Gharana include Khalifa Abid Hussain Khan , Wajid Hussain Khan , Afaaq Hussain , Ilmas Hussain , Hirendra Kumar Ganguly , Santosh Krishna Biswas , Anil Bhattacharjee and Pt .
Swapan Chaudhuri .
Lucknow Gharana gave birth to two other Gharanas : Banaras and Farukhabad

Surbahar , , sometimes known as bass sitar , is a plucked string instrument used in the Hindustani classical music of North India .
It is closely related to the sitar , but has a lower tone .
Depending on the instruments size , it is usually pitched two to five whole steps below the standard sitar , but Indian classical music having no concept of absolute pitch , this may vary .
The instrument can emit frequencies lower than 20 Hz .
The surbahar is over 130 cm .
It uses a dried gourd as a resonator , and has a neck with very wide frets , which allow a glissando of six notes on the same fret through the method of pulling .
The neck is made out of tun , or teak wood .
It has four rhythm strings , four playing strings , and 15 to 17 unplayed sympathetic strings .
There are two bridges ; the playable strings pass over the greater bridge , which is connected to the tabli with small legs , which are glued in place .
The sympathetic strings pass over the smaller bridge which is directly glued on the tabli .
The main bridge has a slightly bent upper surface which results in a droning sound , because the vibrating span of the strings quivers ever so slightly .
The instrumentalist plays the strings using a metallic plectrum , the mizrab , which is fixed on the index finger of the players right hand .
Three plectrums are used to play the dhrupad style of alap , jor , and jhala on surbahar .
In the dhrupad style , instead of performing the sitarkhani and masitkhani gats , the instrumentalist plays the slow dhrupad composition in accompaniment with pakhawaj .
Some researchers believe that surbahar was invented around 1825 .
Though the invention is generally attributed to Ustad Sahebdad Khan , recent research shows that Lucknow - based sitarist Ustad Ghulam Mohammed may have been the inventor

Lal established himself as a staff artist for All India Radio , with whom he served until 1987 .
Among his works as a performer and recording artist in India , he played with sitar virtuosos Ravi Shankar and Debu Chaudhuri .
In 1974 , Shankar chose Lal to join his Music Festival from India revue , which was the largest Indian orchestra to perform in Europe up to that time .
In addition to recording a studio album in England with Shankars ensemble , released on George Harrison s Dark Horse Records in 1976 , Lal toured Europe with the Music Festival .
His fellow performers included leading figures of Indian classical music - among them , Alla Rakha , Lakshmi Shankar , Shivkumar Sharma , Hariprasad Chaurasia , Sultan Khan and L. Subramaniam .

Dagar Gharana is a dhrupad-based stylized singing founded by Ustad Behram Khan .
Some of its popular present day vocalists are Gundecha Brothers .
An award Dagar Gharana Award was instituted in 1981
Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan is an Indian sitar player .
Khan received the national awards Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan and was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for 1987 .
Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan regarded as one of the Sitar Trinity of India along with Ravi Shankar and Vilayat Khan and is the youngest of them .
He was born in 1929 , in Jawra , Madhya Pradesh , as the son of Jaffer Khan , a versatile vocalist , sitarist and beenkar .
He hails from the Beenkar Gharana of Indore .
He has been a distinguished All India Radio Artiste since the early 1940s .
A few years before the Beatles met Ravi Shankar , in 1958 , Khan collaborated with jazz pianist and composer Dave Brubeck .
Brubeck who was in Bombay through the state sponsored jazz diplomacy - the Jazz Ambassadors Program was impressed by the improvisation in Indian music and said that the experience accompanying Halim Jaffer Khan led him to play in a different way .
He says of that meeting , We understood each other .
Khan also performed with the noted English classical guitarist Julian Bream in 1963 .
Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan is perhaps best known for his innovation , Jafferkhani Baaj .
He describes it as , a synthesis of precision in technique , systematic thought with a vigorous playing style .
Cultural anthropologist and reader at the University of Mumbai , Dr. Kamala Ganesh states : His music making is full of eclectic yet deeply informed choices .
He is a thinking musician but puts across his complex views with a simplicity and feeling which demarcate the articulate performer from the articulate theoretician ... In him , one gets an unmistakable sense ... a syncretic tradition .
The Indian santoor player Shivkumar Sharma remembers of Khans performance of the raga Chaayanat : It was probably in 1955-56 , I was relaxing in my terrace in Jammu .
In the stillness of the night I heard the notes of Raga Chaayanat on the sitar emanate from my neighbors radio .
I immediately noticed that the tone of the sitar was completely different and the style of playing radically unique .
I rushed to switch on my radio ... I was totally engrossed and was very curious to know who this maestro was .
Of ragas such as Kirwani , Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan has been credited with bringing Carnatic ragas into the sitar repertoire : Kanakangi , Latangi , Kirwani , Karaharapriya , Manavati , Ganamurti , etc. but rendering them through a Hindustani sensibility and in the Jafferkhani style .
he was the first Hindustani musician to collaborate with Carnatic music in a performance with renowned Veena player Emani Sankara Sastry .
His early experimentation with polytonality in Indian classical instrumentation was achieved in his sitar quintet .
Khan has had a valuable involvement with Indian cinema .
He has composed and played for epic films like Mughal-e-Azam , Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje , Goonj Uthi Shehnai , Kohinoor and has collaborated with noted music directors such as Vasant Desai , C. Ramachandra , Madan Mohan and Naushad who has said , he not only enriched film music , but his participation lent prestige to my songs .
In 1976 , Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan created the Halim Academy of Sitar in Mumbai , India .
His legacy is being carried on by his son Zunain Khan , an accomplished sitarist himself .
Narrated by violinist Yehudi Menuhin , Deben Bhattacharyas film Raga features a young virtuosic Halim Jaffer Khan playing raga Sindh Bhairavi
Kirana Gharana is one of the most prolific Hindustani khyal gharanas .
It was founded in 13th-century by Gopal Nayak , a dhurpadiya or dhrupad singer , and a Hindu court musician based in Kairana , a town in present Shamli district in Uttar Pradesh .
However , later he embraced Islam , and soon he mastered the khayal tradition .
One of its important exponent were Abdul Karim Khan and Abdul Wahid Khan and later Ameer Khan and Bhimsen Joshi .
The name of this school of music derives from Kirana or Kairana , a town and tehsil of Shamli District in Uttar Pradesh .
It is the birthplace of Ustad Abdul Karim Khan , who was one of the most important musicians of this gharana and of Hindustani music in general in the twentieth century , and considered by some to be the real founder of the Kirana Gharana , while the roots of the tradition can be traced back to his great-grandfather Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Maula , the brother of Ghulam Ali .
A frequent visitor to the Court of Mysore , Ustad Abdul Karim Khan was also influenced by Carnatic music .
Much to the credit of Abdul Karim Khan , today most Hindustani musicians from Karnataka are exponents of Kirana Gharana and Kirana Gharana has imbibed many of the features of the Carnatic tradition .
Particularly the culturally fecund border region between Karnataka and Maharashtra is famous for its tradition of the Kirana school of singing .
Another towering figure of this gharana in the early 20th century was Abdul Karim Khan 's cousin Abdul Wahid Khan .
It was late in the nineteenth century that the two ustads Abdul Karim Khansahab and Abdul Waheed Khansahab revolutionized the very concept of khayal gayaki by introducing the vilambit or the slow tempo method to delineate the raga note by note .
In the Kirana Gayaki , the individual swaras of the raga are considered not just random points in the scale but independent realms of music capable of horizontal expansion .
Mind blowing , emotion drenched pukars in the higher octaves form a part of the musical experience .
Another unique feature of this gharana is the highly intricate and ornate use of the sargam taan which was improvised by Ustad Abdul Karim Khansahab as a direct influence of the Carnatic classical style .
Favorite ragas of performers from the Kirana gharana include Todi , Lalit , Multani , Patdeep , Puriya , Marwa , Shuddha Kalyan , Darbari Kanhara , and Komal-Rishabh Asavari .
Noted Marathi thespian PuLa Deshpande has pointed out that performers from the Kirana gharana have had a soft corner for the Komal Rishabh note of the Indian Classical Music scale .
The ragas mentioned above as Kirana favorites support this observation
Vilambit is an introductory slow tempo , or laya , between 10 and 40 beats per minute , used in the performance of a raga in Hindustani classical music .
For major ragas , the vilambit portion generally takes up two-thirds or more of the performance , and is followed by a short drut to conclude the performance
Agra Gharana is a tradition of Hindustani classical vocal music descended from the Nauhar Bani .
So far , Nauhar Bani has been traced back to around 1300 AD , during the reign of Emperor Allauddin Khilji of Delhi .
The first known musician of this tradition is Nayak Gopal .
The style prevalent then in the Gharana was `` Dhrupad-Dhamar '' .
Ustad Ghagghe Khudabuksh introduced the `` Khayal '' style of Gwalior Gharana into Agra gharana which Khudabaksh learnt from Natthan Paribaksh of Gwalior .
Furthermore the Khayal style of Atrauli Gharana was added in the late 19th century .
The gayaki of the Agra Gharana is a blend of khayal gayaki and Dhrupad - Dhamar .
In training , both the khayal and dhrupad components run hand in hand and are not taught in an isolated fashion .
This is obvious from the svaroccara of the Agra Gharana which demands that the projection of voice be more forceful and voluminous than encountered in khayal gayaki.The svarocarra of the gharana also hints the reminiscent of Dhrupad in which swaras are uttered open and bare .
Most khayal performances by artists of Agra gharana commence with the nom - tom alaap , a tradition unique to the Agra gharana .
Different facets of a raga are displayed with the help of bandish or cija while the raga is liberated using vistaar .
The use of bandish or cija for performing a raga is ubiquitous in all Hindustani classical music gharanas but cija or bandish occupy a special position in the teaching methodology of the Agra Gharana .
This is the only Gharana that has still continued to sing Dhrupad-Dhamar along with Nom-Tom Alap , Khayal , Thumri , Tappa , Tarana , Hori , Dadra , Ghazal , Kaul , Rasiya etc
Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale was a Hindustani classical vocalist , a composer , and a teacher .
Bhaskar Bakhale was born in an impoverished migrant Karhade Brahmin family in Kathor , a village in Gujarat , India .
His early training was in dhrupad and kirtan from Vishnubuwa Pingale in Vadodara .
The royal family of Vadodara arranged for musical lessons in the school run by its court musician Maula Baksha .
He then became a child artist at Kirloskar Natak Mandali , a musical theatre troupe of Annasaheb Kirloskar where he had the ganda-bandhan ceremony with Bande Ali Khan , a Rudra Veena performer from Kirana employed by the court of Indore .
Faiz Mohammed Khan of Gwalior gharana taught him in Vadodara 1886-1897 and then recommended further training from Natthan Khan of Agra gharana , a court musician at Jaipur and Mysore , and the father of Vilayat Hussein Khan .
This apprenticeship continued in Mysore and Dharwad till the demise of Natthan Khan in year 1901 .
In 1899 , Natthan Khan recommended further training from Alladiya Khan , the founder of Jaipur-Atrauli gharana and a court musician of Kolhapur .
Starting year 1901 , Bakhale learnt from Alladiya Khan , his brother Haider Khan , and his nephew Natthan Khan .
His apprenticeship with Alladiya Khan continued interrupted until Bakhales own death in 1922 .
Overcome with Bakhales memories , Alladiya Khan broke down and abruptly ended his 1922 Mumbai recital at the residence of Seth Vitthaldas ; the recital was to celebrate the birthday of Seth Vitthaldas and was attended by Shahu Maharaj , the king of Miraj , the king of Dewas , and other dignitaries .
During 1883-1885 , Bakhale performed as a child artist in the stage plays of Kirloskar Natak Mandali where Bhaurao Kolhatkar , Moroba Wagholikar , and Balakoba Natekar earned much fame as singers of folksy and light classical stage songs .
After completing his training in classical music , Bakhale returned as a classical vocalist in year 1899 or so .
During 1897-1901 , he served as a professor of music at a training college in Dharwad .
Starting year 1901 , he was based in Mumbai and Pune but performed throughout India and Nepal .
He was given the honorary title Deva Gandharva .
His notebook lists dhrupads and dhamars learnt by him but he rarely performed those in public .
His typical recital comprised khyal ragas and an assortment of dadra , tappa , thumri , bhajan , songs from Marathi stage plays , and traditional Marathi light classical forms .
He also had a successful career as the music director of Kirloskar Natak Mandali and , afterwards , of Gandharva Natak Mandali .
Govindrao Tembe benefited from Bakhales advisement in composing music for the stage play Sangeet Manapman .
Bakhale then composed music for new Marathi musical theatre stage plays such as Sangeet Vidyaharan , Sangeet Swayamwar , and Sangeet Draupadi by adopting compositions from classical Hindustani music .
These compositions continue to be performed on stage and in Hindustani classical recitals .
Several musicians , including Kumar Gandharva , Vasantrao Deshpande , and Anand Bhate , have released recordings presenting their interpretations of Bal Gandharva s renditions of these compositions .
Bakhale taught and mentored Bal Gandharva from year 1906 until his own death , and also brought Ahmed Jan Thirakwa to Gandharva Natak Mandali as its tabla maestro .
In year 1911 , Bakhale started Bharat Gayan Samaj , an institute to teach music in Pune ; the institute had its centenary in year 2011 .
Disciples to receive Bakhales full formal training were Bal Gandharva , Tarabai Shirodkar , Bapurao Ketkar , and Master Krishnarao Phulambrikar ; among these , Bal Gandharva received training specifically for stage songs only and not for classical vocal .
He also taught others including Dattatreya Bagalkotkar , Narahar Patankar , Gundopant Walawalkar , Ganapat Purohit , Harishchandra Bali , Bhai Lal Amritsari , and Dilip Chandra Vedi .
He also taught Ganesh Ramachandra Behare , a disciple of Abdul Karim Khan , for one year .
Govindrao Tembe , who was his close associate starting 1901 , had no interest in career as a vocalist and , instead , adopted Bakhales teachings for harmonium playing .
Bakhale taught Kesarbai Kerkar for 5 months in year 1914 and occasionally assisted Alladiya Khan in teaching her after she became Alladiya Khans student in year 1921 .
He also taught Vilayat Hussein Khan on a limited basis .
Among these , Govindrao Tembe had a 50 year long career as a harmonium player , as a music composer for stage plays and films , as an author of 5 books and several articles on music and musicians , and as a member of the central audition board of All India Radio .
Bal Gandharva , Master Krishnarao , Vilayat Hussein Khan , and Kesarbai Kerkar had long careers as musicians and eventually became recipients of Padma Bhushan and Sangeet Natak Akademi Award instituted by the Government of India .
Around year 1920 , Tarabai , held in high regards by many including Kesarbai Kerkar , renounced singing and retired to private life at a young age of 30 ; starting 1946 , she made a few live recordings for All India Radio before passing away in 1949 .
Dilip Chandra Vedi became a disciple of Faiyaz Khan of Agra gharana after Bakhales death and had a long career as a vocalist and as an instructor of music at Bharatiya Kala Kendra , New Delhi .
pt ram marathe is the famous disciple of bhaskarbua .
Bakhale was one of the first vocalists to receive traditional training from multiple gharana systems .
Since the turn of the 17th century , Hindustani classical music had become a stronghold of Muslim musicians and Balakrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar was one of the few Hindu vocalists to earn fame at it in the 19th century .
He toured and taught extensively in the states of Maharashtra , Gujarat , and Karnataka .
The next generation of Hindu musicians from these states included Bakhale , Vishnu Digambar Paluskar , Ramakrishna Vaze , and Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande who did much to liberate the teaching and dissemination of classical music and to create an honorable social status for professional musicians .
Unlike Paluskar and Bhatkhande , Bakhale introduced no radical reforms in the teaching methodology or in organizational aspects of this movement .
However , his personal concerts , rapport with other musicians , and compositions for stage plays -- rendered popular by Bal Gandharva , Keshav Bhosale , Dinanath Mangeshkar , and others -- was a major factor in cultivating a taste for classical and semi-classical music in Marathi speaking population of India .
B. R. Deodhar has observed that this contribution is one of the reasons why western India developed and remained as a major force in classical Indian music starting the turn of the 19th century .
Bakhale was universally regarded an ideal and perfectly balanced vocalist but .
his creative contribution to Hindustani classical music itself is suspect since he composed no new Raga and apparently introduced no major technical innovation either .
Bakhale has left no recorded legacy .
Gramophone Company had unsuccessfully arranged for two sets of his recordings in year 1911 .
No trace of his style or musical approach exists today apart from what can be discerned from his semi-classical compositions for stage plays .
His manuscript on all Hindustani classical compositions learnt by him , including the full repertoire of Faiz Mohammed Khan of Gwalior gharana , was in preparation at the time of his death .
Shaila Datar , a musician married to his grandson Sudhir , has since completed this project and has released the book .
Bharat Gayan Samaj , set up by Bakhale in Pune , organizes musical recitals in his memory and observes his anniversaries .
Kalyan Gayan Samaj , set up in Mumbai in year 1926 as a homage to Bakhale , is active in music circles and organizes a conference titled Deva Gandharva Mahotsav annually .
Pracheen Kala Kendra in Chandigarh holds a conference titled All India Bhaskar Rao Nritya and Sangeet Sammelan annually .
Pune University annually confers a Pt .
Bhaskarbuwa Bakhale Award on the student standing first in its Bachelor of Arts program in the music discipline .
Mumbai University annually confers a similar award on the student standing first in its Master of Arts program in the music discipline
Gajanan Anant Joshi also Gajananbuwa Joshi was a unique and versatile vocalist and probably the greatest violinist in the field of Hindustani music .
Pandit Gajananrao Joshi also known , respectfully and affectionately , as Gajananbuwa Joshi came from a family of musicians .
His grandfather Manohar had studied dhrupad and dhamar , and his father Anant Manohar Joshi was a distinguished khayal singer who had studied under Balakrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar .
Gajananbuwa studied gayaki of Gwalior gharana under his father and also under other teachers in whom he found something to learn , and assimilated other styles in his art .
His other gurus were Vazebuwa of Gwailor Gharana , Vilyat Hussein Khan from Agra gharana , Bhurji Khan from Jaipur-Atrauli gharana and Pandit Vinayakrao Ghangrekar for Tabla .
Pandit Gajananbuwa Joshi was a highly skilled violin player by the age of 20 .
His students include vocalist and violinist Madhukar Joshi , Vikas Kashalkar , Ulhas Kashalkar , Padma Talwalkar , and violinist Shridhar Parsekar .
He also taught vocalists Kaushalya Manjeshwar , Shubhada Paradkar , Veena Sahasrabuddhe and Jayashree Patnekar .
His daughter Malini , sons Manohar , Madhukar and Narayan are also trained musicians .
His sons variously took to singing , violin , and tabla .
His grasp was so quick that it is said that Kesarbai Kerkar did not like to have him attend her concerts because he could quickly incorporate her strengths in his own singing .
Buwa worked as a Professor of Music at the Faculty of Music , University of Mumbai in 1970 .
He also worked as a Music Advisor to All India Radio from 1956 to 1968 at Mumbai , Indore and Lucknow Radio Stations .
His autobiography and his compositions for Violin written by him was published in the form of a book by the renowned Mouj Publishing House in Mumbai .
Throughout his life , Gajananbuwa was invited to participate in almost all the major music conferences , festivals and events all over India .
In addition he was also invited to go to Nepal and Pakistan to take part in Music Programmes .
Buwa received the following prestigious awards for his contribution to Indian Classical music both as a violinist and a vocalist .
An award given in 1982 by the ITC Sangeet Research Academy , a Trust promoted by ITC Limited , Calcutta .
Tansen Samman given by the Government of Madhya Pradesh in 1985 .
Gajananbuwa 's first and principal Guru was his father Pandit Anant Manohar Joshi affectionately called Antubuwa .
His family and many of his disciples used to address him as ` Baba ' .
Antubuwa was born in 1881 in a small village ` Kinhai ' near Aundh in Satara District in Maharashtra State .
Antubuwa 's father Pandit Manoharbuwa was also a singer gifted with a melodious and sweet voice .
Pandit Manoharbuwa 's performances were so impressive that in a concert where other musicians were also performing Manoharbuwa would be the last performer ; an honour normally bestowed upon the ` best ' musician in a gathering of several musicians .
Pandit Manoharbuwa unfortunately died when Antubuwa was only seven years of age .
Antubuwa 's mother after some preliminary training in Music to Antubuwa by one Mr. Ayachit approached the great Balkrishnabuwa Ichalkatnjikar who agreed to teach Antubuwa .
Balkrishnabuwa himself was a highly accomplished and eminent musician of Gwalior Gharana Gayaki .
Antubuwa received training from Balkrishnabuwa for about eight to nine years after which Antubuwa began his own career as a Gwalior Gharana Vocalist initially as a court singer of the princely state of Aundh .
As luck would have it Antubuwa got an opportunity to travel with and accompany on Tanpura the Great Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb whose father was Ustad Haddu Khan Saheb one of the originators of the Gwalior Gharana .
Needless to say that exposure to Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb 's Gayaki enriched Antubuwa 's Gayaki .
After couple of years in the company of Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa settled in Mumbai and started his own school of music .
In addition to teaching , Antubuwa also wrote and published books for learners of music .
However , due to the changed circumstances in his life Antubuwa left Mumbai and returned to Aundh as a court singer of the Aundh State .
His services were welcomed by the well cultured and supporter of arts the prince Balasaheb Pantapradhinidhi .
Young Gajanan was already showing signs of a sharp and intelligent learner of his father 's music .
In Mumbai Antubuwa 's school was open for nearly eight hours .
So young Gajanan was exposed to music for a long time on a daily basis .
However Gajananbuwa 's face to face training from Antubuwa started in Aundh .
The initial musical conditioning of Gajananbuwa took place under his father 's tutoring .
The seeds of pure Gwalior Gayaki were thus sown in the fertile mind of Gajananbuwa at a very tender age .
Although Gajananbuwa later mastered the Gayaki of Jaipur and Agra Gharanas his first and last love always remained the Gayaki of Gwalior Gharana .
In fact his Violin playing mostly was based on Gwalior Gayaki .
It is interesting and quite revealing how a good grasp by Gajananbuwa of his father 's Gayaki was observed by none other than the great Ustad Faiyaz Khan Saheb of Agra Gharana .
Gajananbuwa had an opportunity to meet Ustad Faiyaz Khan Saheb in Mysore .
Khansaheb asked Buwa to sing for three consecutive days .
Buwa responded by singing for an hour or so on each day .
After the third day 's singing session of Gajananbuwa Faiyaz Khan Saheb asked Buwa how-come Buwa picked up the Gayaki of Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb given that Buwa would not even have seen Rehamat Khan Saheb let alone listened to Rehamat Khan Saheb 's music .
This is an excellent example of how a sensitive and intelligent young boy learnt the Gayaki of his father Antubuwa whose Gayaki in turn was influenced by Rehamat Khan Saheb 's Gayaki !

Giving a judgement on his sons progress in Music Antubuwa as a Guru of young Gajanan observed that .
`` Gajanan was very intelligent and quick to pick up with ease - like a blotting paper - the various features of Gayaki !
He had an inherent talent for rhythm .
He also learnt ` Jaltarang ' Harmonium , and Sitar .
He thus learnt both Gwalior Gayaki and instrumental music at a young age '' .
Listening to Antubuwa 's performance is like going close to the original roots of Gwalior Gayaki the Gayaki that Gajananbuwa preserved and enriched throughout his life .
Here are couple of anecdotes about Antubuwa that give some insight in the depth of Antubuwas thinking about Music .
One of Gajananbuwas disciples gave his maiden performance in the Shivanand Sangeet Mahotsava in Aundh .
After his performance was over , the somewhat nervous disciple approached Antubuwa and asked how did he - i e the disciple performed .
Antubuwa asked the disciple what Raga he rendered .
The disciple named the Raga .
The young disciple was eager to learn Antubuwas response .
After a pause Antubuwa said Well , Now that you have rendered such and such Raga , when would you start SINGING the MUSIC .
We leave the reader to work out the relevance of this story .
On another occasion whilst teaching one of his disciples Antubuwa said : A Raga is not a flat in Bombay with two doors .
It is a palace with hundred doors !

The same concept about Raga that it has many faces was described by a metaphor of an elephant who can be viewed by many angles .
The vocalist who described it was another great musician of recent times - Pandit Kumar Gandharva .
Perhaps this is an example of how great minds think alike !

Pandit Antubuwa passed away in 1967 in Gajananbuwa 's house in Dombivali .
For an in depth analysis of Antubuwas Music please refer to Dr Ashok Da Ranades book They lit the way .
Some anecdotes in Gajananbuwas life and career as a Musician : .
antubuvaanii buvaaNnaa ptraatuun lihile tujhii srv gaaykaaNnii hRdyaapaasuun taariiph kelii .
tii aikuun dhny jhaalo .
mii tulaa shikvle tyaace ciij jhaale !

In Gwalior on listening to Gajananbuwa in his vocal concert many music lovers and singers remarked to Antubuwa that his sons performance was matchless - without an equal !
Antubuwa in his letter to his son wrote I was so happy to hear so many singers admiring your singing from the bottom of their hearts .
I got my reward of being your Guru !

This fascinating event is narrated by Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur .
Baburao was the president of the famous Deval Music Club in Kolhapur when this event took place .
What follows is a brief paraphrased version in English of Baburao 's original piece in Marathi .
`` A programme to pay reverence and to honour the legendary actor singer Bal Gandharva for his immortal contribution to Marathi Theatre and Music took place in the Palace Theatre in Kolhapur .
The princess of the Kolhapur State Taraabi Saheb was the chief guest .
The organisers of the event had also arranged a violin recital of Pandit Gajananbuwa with an accompaniment on Tabla by Ustad Thirakhwa Khan Saheb .
Bal Gandharva was one of Buwa 's heroes .
Buwa started the recital with Raga Mulatani .
Buwa was in an excellent mood and spirit to pay his own respects to Bal Gandharva .
Buwa 's Mulatani on Violin and khansaheb 's accompaniment on Tabla overwhelmed the audience with joy !
No sooner the clapping noise of the audience was over than Buwa played the opening notes of the landmark song ` Narawar Krishna Saman ' .
Not only did the lyrical , playful and romantic rendering of Buwa 's violin almost mesmerised the audience but Bal Gandharva himself spontaneously uttered vaa vaa , devaa clapping his hands !

The excerpts from Baburao Joshis original piece in Marathi are given below : .
pd sNpl .
kaarykrm sNplaa .
pnn buvaa aanni khaansaaheb yaaNcii jodd ` ii mnaatuun hllii naahii !

A similar event took place later in Pune .
The location was the N M V High School .
On the grounds of the school a stage was built to celebrate Master Krishnaraos 60th Birthday .
Master Krishnaraos friends , fans , and disciples had organised a three day festival of music .
Musicians from different parts of India participated in the celebration .
Among them were Bade Gulam Ali Khan Saheb , Ustad Ajamat Hussain Khan Saheb , Gajananbuwa , and Ustad Thirakwa Khansaheb .
Gajanabuwa was an admirer of Master Krishnarao .
When Buwas turn came to play violin he started his recital with Raga Jogkans .
As usual Buwas extempore rhythmic work and Khansahebs equally ingenious accompaniment more than pleased the listeners .
Before Buwa started to play the second piece , Master Krishnarao who was sitting in the front made a request to Buwa .
Surprise !
Surprise !
Master Krishnarao asked Buwa to play Narwar Krishna Samman .
To witness this extraordinary concert was once in a lifetime opportunity !
Buwas violin was singing the tender and loving poem about Rukimini falling in love with Krishna .
Master Krishnarao and other celebrity musicians were showering the spontaneous responses to Buwas performance !
Here was the live music making at its best where the musicians and the listeners became one !

The significance of these two events is not easy to appreciate for many of us .
Here was Bal Gandharva one of the greatest singers of all time who had sung this song ` Narawar Krishna Saman ' thousand times on the stage .
He had almost ` lived ` this song !
Here was Master Krishnaro a friend , a colleague and a Guru Bandhu of Bal Gandharva .
He had acted with Bal Gandharva and would have listened to Narawar Krishna Samaan thousand times .
Ask the question : What was it that Bal Gandharva and Krishnarao found in Buwa 's rendering of the song that so much appealed to them ?
Only Bal Gandharva and Master Krishnarao would know the answer to this question .
However let us venture to guess or speculate an answer : .
Music is an abstract art form .
Through Music a musician may be searching some kind of experience that transcends the material world , an experience that is spiritual .
That search may be for the ultimate beauty , ultimate truth , God or Brahman or whatever you may call it .
Geniuses like Bal Gandharva and Master Krishnarao perhaps did get that feel of spiritual experience in their own music making .
It may be that their own experience of singing a song like Narawar Krishna Samaan mirrored in the act of listening to Gajananbuwas rendering of this song .
May be they re-experienced , relived that feel of the transcendental in Gajananbuwas music !

For Gajananbuwa to receive such an accolade from Narayanrao and Master - as Buwa often used to refer to Bal Gandharva and Krishnarao-must have been one of the finest and satisfying moments in his life .
There can not be a better evidence than these two concerts described above to support a value judgement that Gajananbuwa was probably the Greatest Violin Player if such an evidence is needed at all !

We see here an interesting chain of connections .
Ustad Alladiya Khan Saheb - the Mount Everest of Hindustani Classical Music had applauded Bal Gandharvas Gayaki .
Bal Gandharva and Master Krishnarao applauded Gajananbuwas singing violin .
Buwa was a disciple of Alladiya Khansahebs disciple and son Ustad Bhurji Khansaheb .
Bal Gandharva and Master Krishnarao were disciples of Alladiya Khan Sahebs disciple Pandit Bhaskarbuwa Bakhale !

For most music listeners whatever their level of competence and knowledge in Music there clearly is some indescribable magic in Buwa 's rendering of ` Narwar Krishna Saman ' .
That magic is as fresh today as it was then .
In 1950-51 , an all-India music conference was organised in Bharatiya Vidyabhavan in Mumbai that was broadcast by All India radio .
Gajananbuwa was invited to play Violin and so was Ustad Thirkhwa Khasaheb to accompany Buwa .
Another well known Tabla player of Banaras Gharana the well known Pandit Samta Prasad was also an invitee to the conference .
Pandit Sampta Prasad having heard that Thirkhawa Khansaheb was to accompany Gajananbuwa , asked the AIR management why am I not accompanying Gajananbuwa ?

He is such a well known musician .
Why only Thirkhawa Khansaheb should accompany Gajananbuwa ?

After some discussion between Buwa , AIR management and Thirkhawa Khansaheb , Khansaheb suggested that both Samta Prasad and he shoud accompany Buwa .
In the end it was agreed that both the Tabla masters would individually accompany Buwa .
Rarely two great Tabla players were so eager to accompany a great instrumentalist !

Here is a real treat for you .
Gajananbuwa plays Raga Mulatani and Khansaheb accompanies him on Tabla , a live performance .
Please visit Pandit Gajananbuwas Website for more information .
Pandit Gajananbuwa was one of the most versatile musicians of his time .
Indeed you could argue that he was a unique musician .
Here is a brief summary of the key facts of Gajananbuwa 's life .
He was a child prodigy .
He started translating the musical configuration - Tanas - in the musical notation - Saragama - at a young age .
Of course one could argue that Buwas talent at a young age was not a surprise because he was the son of the Great Pandit Antubuwa Joshi !

He was one of the few musicians who had mastered the Gayaki of three different Gharanas - i.e. Singing style of three musical traditions - schools .
It is difficult enough to learn and grasp the Gayaki of one Gharana .
It takes many years may be a lifetime to master the Gayaki of a single Gharana .
Buwa however mastered the traditions of three musical schools in one lifetime .
He was probably the only Musician of an exceptionally high standard who was both a vocalist and an instrumentalist .
Indeed he is rightly credited to have introduced the use of violin to play the Indian Classical Music .
He was an undisputed grand master of Laya - Rhythm .
He was an illustrious Guru who generously taught , trained and passed on his knowledge and Gayaki on a one to one basis to many noted musicians of today who continue the tradition of his musical style .
Buwa had an unending thirst to learn music , understand music , master music , widen his knowledge of music , and get a deep insight in music .
The obvious way to quench his thirst was to expose himself to the Gayaki of various established musicians of his time and then to learn and master the Gayaki of different Gharanas .
Mastering the Gayaki of a given Gharana naturally involved mastering new Ragas and new compositions .
However a question arises as to what was the source of Buwa 's thirst for being a lifelong learner of music ?
What motivated him ?

The source of such hunger to learn may have lied in his sheer sense of wonder and excitement about the beauty and the depth of the vast Universe of Music .
After learning and mastering Gwalior Gharana Gayaki from his father Pandit Antubuwa a young , ambitious and upcoming Buwa came in contact with other musical traditions .
Being aware of his own strength in terms of his sharp intellect , excellent memory , quick grasp of the musical material presented , fertile imagination and also the limitation of the quality of his poor voice he seems to have chosen the Gurus and the Gharanas that matched his musical background and his strength and limitations .
Thus he started his musical journey as a child learning from his father the great Pandit Antubuwa .
His further musical growth came about when he became a disciple of Pandit Vazebuwa .
It was Vazebuwa 's complex Gwailor Gayaki that attracted Gajananbuwa to Vazebuwa .
This was followed by his progress to the beautifully structured , logically precise and tightly woven complex Gayaki of Jaipur Gharana under the tutelage of his Guru Ustad Bhurji Khansaheb .
And finally in his late forties to enrich his Gayaki further he became a disciple of Ustad Vilayat Hussain Khansaheb to master the rhythm based ` Nom Tom ' Gayaki of Agra Gharana .
A remarkable and unique journey indeed !

He almost invariably sang Khyal in his performances .
He presented a given Raga in a well defined framework of a given Gharana .
His remarkable talent was such that in singing a Jaipur Gharana Raga say there would be no trace whatsoever of the Gayaki of another Gharana .
He did sometimes start with ` Nom Tom ' of Agra Gharana and would continue singing a Khyal in Gwailor Gharana Tradition .
But the two parts of his performance would be distinct , and the movement or flow from Nom Tom to Aalapi would be smooth and natural .
There would never be any mixture of Aalapi or Tana Patterns or phrases of the Gayaki of two or more Gharanas .
An extraordinary feat !

One of the key lessons Buwa learnt from his Guru Vazebuwa was how to unravel or unfold a given Raga .
The result of mastering this lesson from Vazebuwa was that in Gajananbuwa 's performances a listener would often experience both the clarity and simplification of complex patterns of Tanas .
The so-called conceptual or intellectual Gayaki of Jaipur Gharana sounded less complex in Buwa 's presentation .
His voice as a result of a continuous and rigorous daily Riyaz of many hours had acquired extraordinary weight and perfect tunefulness .
His tremendous and legendary hard work to Improve the quality of his voice is well documented .
One is reminded of a wonderful quote by Nietzsche the great German Philosopher : .
I know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and the impossible .
Far from perishing Gajananbuwa overwhelmingly succeeded in acquiring his weighty , tuneful and sonorous voice .
A broken earthen pot transformed into a golden jar !

The great Hirabai Badodekar once after attending Buwa 's concert in Pune in an annual Ganapati Festival generously complimented Buwa by saying Buwa , you are so exceedingly perfect in your tunefulness .
It seems that underlying Buwa 's musical journey there was a search for ORDER .
Music can be defined as ordered sound in time .
Buwa 's love for Laya , his complete mastery of Talas and rhythm , his restlessness to learn the Jaipur Gayaki - that is the very incarnation of the concept of order in a musical form - after he heard Surshree Kesarbai and his eventual success in mastering the Jaipur Gayaki are all examples of his instinctive and natural love for ` ORDER ' .
Some mathematicians define Mathematics as the science of order .
We may describe Music as an Art of order .
If Gajananbuwa had chosen to be a Mathematician it is more than likely that he would have made some significant contribution to Mathematics .
But the world of Hindustani Art Music is fortunate that he became a singer .
For otherwise the Indian Classical Music would have lost one of the finest vocalist of recent times who only lived for MUSIC - to learn , to teach and to perform Music !

For an excellent technical and lucid exposition of Buwa 's Gayaki , please check out Dr Ashok Da Ranade 's beautifully written essay in his book : Some Hindustani Musicians .
They Lit The Way .
Dr. Ashok Ranade a well known Musicologist and scholar was a disciple of Buwa .
The above book is published by Promilla & Co in association with Bibliophile South Asia .
To listen to Gajananbuwas vocal music please visit to the following link : .
Violin is capable of expressing precision , power , agility and a kind of mystical or spiritual beauty .
In the hands of a creative musician or a composer it has the ability to convey a deep emotion or a range of emotions imaginatively and intensely .
In other words violin is capable of extraordinary lyricism .
Violin is THE key string instrument in the Western Classical Music .
A western Classical Symphony without a violin is like Valmiki 's Ramayan without Rama or Shakespeare 's play Hamlet without the character of Hamlet .
Symphony is considered the highest form of musical expression in the Western Classical Music .
The Raga Sangeet - The Raga Based Musical System - is the highest form of musical expression in the Hindustani Art Music .
Pandit Gajananbuwa 's greatest achievement was to introduce violin to the world of Hindustani Art Music .
Note however that Buwa went well beyond simply introducing Violin to Hindustani Art Music .
He was and remains probably the Greatest Violinist in the field of Hindustani Art Music .
The entry of violin in Buwa 's life was an accident and a happy accident at that for the world of Hindustani Music !
Buwa 's father the great Antubuwa was a court singer in the small princely state of Aundh in Maharashtra .
The prince of Aundh was a culturally refined person .
He himself was a KIRTANKAR - kiirtnkaar .
The Prince of Aundh had an old violin that he gave to Antubuwa so that young Gajanan can accompany the Prince in his story telling recitals.Gajanan who was only a young boy obeyed his father and thus started his career as a violinist .
Gajananbuwa had no formal training or guidance from any one whatsoever in the technique of using and playing the violin .
There was no guidance to him about the intrinsic properties of a violin so that he can make proper use of such properties in his music making .
In short Buwa was a totally self trained violinist .
He naturally developed his technique to suit the musical material he wanted to present on the violin .
What was this material ?
It was his rich repertoire of Raga Sangeet that consisted of Ragas , compositions and Gwalior Gharana Gayaki .
What other musical material Buwa presented on his violin ?

Buwa was somewhat conscious of the not-so-good quality of his voice and may have felt that his voice was not adequate to sing the feel of the lighter musical phrases of Murakis or Khatakas to convey the lyricism of non-khyal genres of Hindustani Art Music .
Add to that his love and admiration for Bal Gandharva and Master Krishnarao .
Is it a surprise then that he found violin to be the best vehicle to play the famous songs from Marathi Musical Theatre and Dhuns in Ragas Kafi , Khamaj , Mand or Pilu ?
His semi classical pieces on violin revealed his romantic , playful , lyrical and imaginative musical mind .
What he lost in his adolescence by way of his broken voice was at least partially gained by his acquiring a superb mastery of violin .
Buwa exploited his proficiency in playing violin with a vengeance !
In almost every violin concert Buwa presented at least one Dhun or a Natya Song to the delight of his listeners .
But more importantly he fruitfully engaged in exploring the world of semi classical Hindustani Music .
What is remarkable is that Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole shows his masterful grasp of a wide range of musical genres .
In his vocal mode he sang only khyals of the three Gharanas .
In his violin playing he created his own compositions and rendered them in his Khyal Gayaki idiom .
And he displayed his creativity in the semi classical genres that allowed him a free play of his imagination .
In his violin playing his love and mastery of the rhythm and Tala gave him sufficient scope to display his aggressive rhythmic work using his forceful and somewhat rough bow work .
Is it a wonder that music lovers all over India enjoyed his violin concerts when Ustad Thirkhawa Khan Saheb accompanied Buwa on Tabla .
Here was an astounding treat to the music lovers when these two outstanding musicians would be improvising the dazzling magic of rhythmic patterns within the fixed framework of a given Tala !

Despite Buwa 's popularity as a violinist and his presence in the numerous concerts and musical conferences all over India , Buwa 's true love was his Gayaki in vocal mode .
He was the son of a great vocalist Pandit Antubuwa and his ambition was to be equally a great vocalist in his own right and continue the tradition of Antubuwa 's Gayaki .
He did succeed in fulfilling his ambition .
But in addition , thanks to the prince of Aundh 's gift of the violin to Buwa , Hindustani Art Music received a precious gift of Gajananbuwa 's violin that SANG Classical and semi classical music !

The expression singing violin can be truly and justifiably applied to Buwas violin .

Here is a web link for Gajananbuwas one to one tuitions he gave to his disciples .
Whenever Buwa sings a Jaipur Gharana composition he presents his structured rhythmic work more beautifully than the vocalists of Jaipur Gharana .
That surely has to be acclaimed as Buwas triumph !

Mr Vamanrao Deshpande - Musicologist , singer and critic : .
In the current somewhat run-down state of the Gwailor Gharana Gayaki that is the mother of other Gharanas , Pandit Gajananbuwa Joshi is at the forefront of Gwailor Gharana carrying forward its rich tradition .
Professor G H Ranade in the Sangeet Natak Academy Journal Number 4 writes : .
Gajananbuwa is ranked today , as a master of musicians .
In his own turn , he has added one more feather to his cap , by mastering the art of playing the violin , in a class by himself .
Antubuwas greatest contribution to music is thus personalised in his son Gajananbuwa .
What a wonderful compliment !

The best combination heard in the Sammelan was violin by Gajananrao Joshi of Bombay and tabla by Karamatullah Khan of Calcutta .
Both played with inspiration and verve and opened up new vistas of aesthetic enjoyment .
Joshis Raga Khamaj was intensely lyrical and was enlivened by occasional counterpoints .
His dancing reproduced by Karamatullah on tabla , to which the latter added his own inimitable fluttering notes .
Katamatullah could have stood on his own without occasional histrionics which detracted from the dignity of the occasion .
This is a rare gem .
Not many violin players have played GAVATI in this style .
Variety shown is indeed awesome.Those who have heard him live will bless you for ever .
Thanks a ton for uploading Jaijaivanti by Antubuwa ... I had listened to a 25-30 min recording in Shree by Antubuwa ... I was stunned after listening to Shree ... What a style of singing ... And Gajananbuwa is equally amazing during the vocal support .
There is no doubt that Pandit Gajananbuwa Joshi is legendary and will continue to delight his fans all over the world .
I have listened to a few tracks on the AudioFarm website and before I had never heard of Pandit Gajananbuwa Joshi or his pieces .
I have bookmarked the AudioFarm Pandit Gajananbuwa Joshi page and will listen to it in my spare free time .
Gajananbuwas vocal rendering of Bhimpalas is superb .
What is interesting about Buwas performance is that he starts with Nom Tom .
I recently listened to Faiyaz Khansahebs DES .
Outstanding !
I just love Nom Tom of Khansaheb , Dhrupad vocalists , Gajananbuwa and Ratnjankarbuwas few pieces among other musicians of Agra Gharana .
For me the way these singers perform Nom Tom is like a Bhakta asking the GOD of SWARS to bless them - the singers - by showing the inner beauty of the Swaras that is somehow hidden from them .
The singers are telling the God of Swaras - try as much as they do , the secret of that divine beauty of the Swars is some how not within their reach .
Hence their surrender to the SWARAS through the Nom Tom !!

May be Gajananbuwa was attracted to Agra Gharana for its singing of Nom Tom .
Of course having mastered the singing of Agra Gharana , Gajananbuwa had an advantage of presenting a given Raga in Agra Gharana Gayaki .
Is it a wonder that in many of his performances he would start with Nom Tom of Agra Gharana and follow the presentation in Gwailor Gharana style .
This is precisely what Buwa does in his performance of Bhimpalas .
What a delightful performance !

In my opinion a sonorous voice , strong fundamentals of music , a very good sense of laya and honesty towards art are the distinct features of Gajananbuwa that make his music dear to the ear .
Practice lessons prepared by Bach - one of the greatest Composers of the Western Classical Music - are similar to Gajananbuwas tuition piece for the Raga Deskar.-Bachs work has become a part of the Western Classical Music repertoire and indeed a concert piece !
The piece is called Well-Tempered Claviers .
In my view Buwas tuition piece such as the Palatas in Sargam in Raga Deskar as it stands would be a concert piece and may well have the same place in the Indian Classical Music as Bachs Well-Tempered Clavier has a place in Western Classical Music .
The legendary Bal Gandharva once said to Antubuwa the father of Gajananbuwa : .
Antubuwa , it is no surprise that your son Gajananbuwa sings Gwailor Gayaki so well .
After all he was brought up at home with your Gwailor Gayaki .
But Gajananbuwa presents the Jaipur Gharana Gayaki also with such mastery and confidence .
This appreciation coming from Bal Gandharva speaks volumes about Gajananbuwas Jaipur Gayaki !
Note also that Bal Gandharva himself was taught by Pandit Bhaskarbuwa Bakhale a disciple of Ustad Alladiya Khansaheb the founder of Jaipur Atrauli Gharana .
Here is a comment by Pandit Sujan Rane of New Jersey USA on Gajananbuwas performance of the famous song Dehata Sharanagata in Manapman on violin .
Pandit Rane was a desciple of Pandit Firoz Dastur of Kirana Gharana .
The recording of Buwas presentation of Dehata Sharanagata almost brought tears to my eyes .
Only Chhota Gandharva could sing such varieties .
Again I was fortunate to accompany him at Balmohan School , Dadar when I was learning Classical Music .
I remember that Chhota Gandharva had sung Dehata Sharanangata in four different ways at public demand , at Ravindra Natya Mandir way back in 60s .
The emperor of Tabla the Great Ustad Thirakhawa Khan Saheb said about Pandit Gajananbuwa : .
To date I have not seen such a fearless artist among Brahmins .
This comment was Khansahebs compliment to and appreciation of Buwas adventurous , aggressive , extempore and perfect rhythmic work in general and in particular when Khansaheb was accompanying Buwa on Tabla .
Is it a wonder that Buwas Violin and Khansahebs Tabla accompaniment was always a real treat to the music lovers and even the Great Grand Masters like Bal Gandharva and Master Krishnrao !

She was a music producer at All India Radio and later with Doordarshan .
She started her musical training under Girja Shankar Chakravarty in her teens , later restarted it with Mushtaq Hussain Khan Rampur-Sahaswan gharana and Rasoolan Bai of Benaras gharana in the 1950s .
Born in an aristocratic family in Kolkata , she was married into the royal family of Kapurthala State at age 16 , and was started singing in concerts only after her husband died in 1949 , and she moved to Delhi .
In 1974 , she was awarded the Padma Shri , the fourth highest civilian honour given by Government of India .
Born Nilina Sen , in an aristocratic Bengali family in Kolkata , where her grandfather was Keshub Chandra Sen , nationalist leader and social reformer from the Brahmo Samaj movement .
Youngest of her four siblings , brother Sujit , and sisters Binita and Sadhona , Nilina grew amidst liberal upbringing from their parents Saral Chandra Sen , a barrister and Nirmala .
She first got interested in music , when her uncle , Panchu took young Nilina to a concert of Angurbala , at a local theatre .

The Bishnupur Gharana is a form of singing that follows the Dhrupad tradition of Hindustani music , one of the two forms of Indian classical music .
It originated in Bishnupur , West Bengal , India in late 18th-century .
The name of the town means city of Vishnu in Bengali .
In the ancient past , this area , known as Mallabhum was the abode of Malla Kings who were vassals to the Mughal Empire who were devotees of Lord Vishnu and patrons of music .
Bishnupur Gharana was established in 1370 A. D. by the court musicians of Malla Kings .
Historians suggest that ` Mallabhum ' had once been the cultural centre of Eastern India .
It also has the distinction of being the only Gharana in West Bengal .
The gharana is reputed to have been established in the 13th century , even though there is no historic evidence to support this .
In the 17th century , during the reign of Mughal emperor Aurangazeb , Islamic fanaticism was at its peak in the Mughal empire , and thus many musicians moved to the court of the Maharaja of Bishnupur who was a known patron of the arts .
The famous Dhrupad Singer Bahadur Khan of the Senia Gharana , descendant of Tansen , fled to Bishnupur and made his Gharana popular and sought refuge in the court .
Bahadur Khan was not only a vocalist but could also efficiently play on such instruments as the Veena , the Rabaab , the surashringaar .
The king , Raghunath Singh Deo II , made all arrangements to honour him as his court singer .
The Maharaja also announced that anyone having a sweet voice and interested in music could learn from Bahadur Khan without any fees .
He also bore the financial liability for the poor students .
In time , a good number of students became the disciples of Bahadur Khan .
Historical evidence points to Pt .
Ramachandra Bhattacharya , a desciple of Ud .
Bahadur Khan as the founder of the gharana .
Bishnupur Gharana therefore has a strong link to Betia Gharana through this unbroken relationship .
In the later part of the eighteenth century and towards the early and mid-nineteenth century , when music of different ` Gharanas ' were gradually assimilating around the Khayal style , the Dhrupad style continued flourishing among the musicians of Bishnupur .
Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande desired to be a disciple of Radhika Prasad Goswami since he found the most authentic renditions of the ragas and the most exhaustive repertoire of songs in Bishnupur Gharana .
In 1921 when Prince Edward came to visit India , six artists of various gharanas were chosen to perform six Ragas for six Seasons .
Three of them were from Bishnupur Gharana : Gopeswar Bandyopadhyay , Satyakinkar Bandyopadhyay and Khetra Mohan Goswami .
First maiden Gramophone record in Khayal in 1902 Tara Parameshwari by Lal Chand Baral , who learnt under Ramprassanna Bandyopadhyay published by Gramophone Concert and Nicole .
First Dhrupad record In 1902 Naad Bidya Sabse Sera Raag Darbari , Taal Choutal , by Surendranath Bandyopadhyay published by Gramophone Concert .
Khayal started from Ramshankar Bhattachariya 's age .
His writings on Khayal is being found Bramhamoyi Paratpara , on the Raga Yaman Kalyan .
Ramprasanna Bandyopadhyay was the foremost Surbahar and Sitar Artist of India up to 1928 .
Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande first came across the Ustads of Bishnupur in a conference in Benaras around 1921/22 and this conference was attended by Radhika Prasad Goswami , Gopeswar Bandyopadhyay and Satyakinkar Bandyopadhyay .
They gave a trio performance in Dhrupad .
After this they gave individual performance .
Satyakinkar Bandyopadhyay also played Sitar in that conference and stood first along with Enayat khan .
In this style , the artist excels in unfolding the beauty of the Raga through the alap .
It is simple , devoid of heavy , cumbersome ornamentation .
It is free from intricate play with the rhythm .
Layakari is however allowed in Dhamar , another form of vocalization .
The Khayal of the Bishnupur School is noted for its sweet , lilting melody .
It is adorned with the usual ornaments , which add variety to the melodic presentation of the Raga .
The dhrupad of the Bishnupur gharana uses shuddha dhaivata in raga vasanta , a touch of komal nisada in the descending notes of Raga Bhairava .
It has abandoned kadi madhyam in raga ramakeli , and uses suddha dhaivata in raga puravi and Raga Lalita and komal nisad in raga vehaga .
It has also developed its own character with regard to rhythm .
It was this gharana which invented the tradition of Sawal-Jabab in Hindustani Music.n .
Its origins and the development have led to a great openness in the teaching and evolution within this gharana .
Most of the exponents of Bishnupur learnt Dhrupad vocal and instrumental music simultaneously .
In spite of producing such a talented group of musicians , Bishnupur lacked venues for performances .
This prevented Bishnupur from becoming a performance center for the artists of the gharana.It was only in 2007 that an auditorium was opened in the town enabling public performances in the music of the gharana to the listening public
Rag Lalit is a studio album by Indian classical musician Ram Narayan , released in 1989 .
Recorded December 3 , 1987 , in Wyastone Leys near Monmouth , Wales , the album features a performance of the serene dawn raga Lalit on sarangi .
Narayan performs a long non-metrical introduction to unfold the raga , during which he adds a pulse , until he is joined by tabla to perform a composition .
The album consists of a single track performance of the raga Lalit .
Lalit is commonly described as calm and devotional and is performed at dawn .
Neil Sorrel portrayed Lalit as conveying a feeling of instability and connects this to the performance time , when night changes into day .
Rag Lalit was recorded in a single take in Wyastone Leys near Monmouth , Wales , on December 3 , 1987 , and includes the tuning of the sarangis sympathetic strings through plucking .
In the performance , Narayan plays a long alap and a jor that increases in speed and range and makes use of gamaks .
Suresh Talwalkar , a frequent accompanist of Narayan , joins in playing a gat in the rhythmic 16-beat cycle tintal , which is separated into four groups of four beats .
When Talwalkar plays a solo , the sarangi repeats the melody .
The performance was mastered in England , but not edited .

Trilok Gurtu is an Indian percussionist and composer , whose work has blended the music of his homeland with jazz fusion , world music and other genres .
He has released his own albums and has collaborated with many artists , including Terje Rypdal , Gary Moore , John McLaughlin , Jan Garbarek , Joe Zawinul , Bill Laswell , Maria Joao & Mario Laginha , and Robert Miles .
Gurtu was born to Hindu Brahmin parents in Mumbai , and attended Don Bosco High School in Mumbai .
His mother , singer Shobha Gurtu , encouraged him to learn playing tabla , and he studied playing the instrument under Shah Abdul Karim .
Gurtu began playing western drum kit in the 1970s , and developed interest in jazz .
In a 1995 television special on Jimi Hendrix , Gurtu mentioned having initially learned Western music without awareness of overdubbing , which , he said , forced him to learn multiple parts which most musicians would have never attempted .
In the 1970s , he played with Charlie Mariano , John Tchicai , Terje Rypdal , and Don Cherry .
One of Gurtus earliest recordings was around 1977 in the record Apo-Calypso in an album of the German ethnic fusion band , Embryo .
His mother also sang in that record , and later joined him in his first solo CD , Usfret .
In the 1980s , Gurtu played with Swiss drummer Charly Antolini and with John McLaughlin in McLaughlins trio , accompanied variously by bassists Jonas Hellborg , Kai Eckhardt , and Dominique DiPiazza .
The line-up with Hellborg performed at least one concert opening for Miles Davis in Berkeley , California in 1988 .
Collaboration between Gurtu and McLaughlin included vocal improvisations using the Indian tala talk method of oral drumming notations for teaching drum patterns .
Sometimes , Eckhardt would join in with hip-hop beat-box vocals for a three-way vocal percussion jam , while Gurtu and McLaughlin would throw in a few amusing words such as some Japanese brand names mixed with some Indian words .
Some of the unusual aspects of Gurtus drum playing include playing , without a drum stool , in a half-kneeling position on the floor , and use of an unconventional kick drum that resembles a large drum head with a kick-pedal , and a mix of tablas and western drums .
Gurtus unique percussion signature involves dipping cymbals and strings of shells into a bucket of water to create a shimmering effect .
Gurtu joined Oregon after the death of drummer Collin Walcott .
He played in three records produced by this band : Ecotopia , 45th Parallel , and Always , Never and Forever .
In the early 1990s Gurtu resumed his career as a solo artist and a bandleader .
Various noted musicians have backed him in a number of his CD releases .
In 1999 , Zakir Hussain and Bill Laswell founded a musical group , Tabla Beat Science , which played a mixture of Hindustani music , Asian underground , ambient , Drum and Bass , and Electronica .
Gurtu joined this group along with Karsh Kale and Talvin Singh .
The group released three albums before going dormant in late 2003 .
In 2004 , Gurtu created an album , Miles Gurtu , with Robert Miles .
His collaboration with the Arke String Quartet began in 2007 with the release of the album Arkeology .
In 2010 Trilok Gurtu played into the album Piano Car , opera of minimalist composer Stefano Ianne with Ricky Portera , Nick Beggs , Mario Marzi , Terl Bryant , John De Leo .
In 2012 , Trilok Gurtu collaborated with electronic folk duo Hari & Sukhmani in their hometown of Chandigarh and produced a song Maati on the music documentary-travelogue The Dewarists .

Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha was the eldest son of Raja Bahadur Kirtyanand Sinha of the Banaili estate .
As the eldest child of a Raja , Shyamanad Sinha had many pursuits that was the hallmark of the aristocracy then but one that made him extraordinary was his talent and ability in hindustani classical music .
Though Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha learned music from many eminent names , his acknowledged Guru was the legendary Ustad Vishmadev Chattopadyay of Kolkata , who in turn had learnt music from Ustad Badal Khan of Delhigharana and Ustad Faiyaz Khan of agra Gharana .
The musical journey of Shyamanand Sinha began early in his life when he started playing harmonium and clarionet with an elder relation in his family .
The turnaround happened when in 1935 , he happened to come across a 78 RPM record of Ustad Vishmadev Chattopadyay .
The record had Rut Basant in Raga Rageshri Bahar and Piya Pardes in Patdeep , famous renditions by the Ustad .
This moved him so much that he was now determined to learn music from him .
When Ustad Vishmadev Chattopadyay visited his home for a performance in Champanagar , he created an even deeper impression on him .
Kumar Girijanand Sinha in his book , Banaili - Roots to Raj , notes that he was so moved by his performance that he began weeping like a baby .
He earnestly requested and was able to convince the Ustad of his sincerity , and so the Ustad agreed to become his Guru .
Shyamanand Sinha learnt from Ustad Vishmadev Chattopadyay from 1936 to 1939 .
After Vishmadev Chattopadyay left for Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry , Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha continued his music lessons , at the advice of his guru , from Ustad Bachu Khan Sahib of Agra .
Ustad Bachu Khan was the son of Ustad Badal Khan.Other eminent singers from whom he obtained music lessons were Ustad Muzzaffar Khan , Ustad Mubarak Ali Khan , Pandit Bholanath Bhatt , Kedarjee , Ustad Altaf Hussain Khan of Khurja , Mahaveer Mullick , and Jaduveer Mullick .
Though not a professional vocalist , Shyamanand Sinhas singing was a literal feast for the listeners .
He was not only blessed with a gifted voice but had tremendous natural ability to bring pran in ragas and make them come alive in a most pleasing manner .
He belonged to the old school of Hindustani classical music and believed in maintaining purity and spontaneity in performance .
His rendition of bandishes , and he possessed a veritable treasure trove obtained from his gurus , was an absolute delight and mesmerised the listeners transferring the singers sense of ecstasy to the audience in a way that very few have managed to this day .
His choice of bandishes for performances were carefully selected for their sahityic value .
He laid particular emphasis on the mood of words and with extraordinary felicity married them to the mood of the ragas .
For this reason , he stood apart from the current day performers as well as many of his contemporaries .
A taan was to be used to beautify the rendition , where apt , and in the raganga , not just for its sake .
Lamenting about modern classical music , in an interview with AIR , he stated Ab to Bilaskhani me bhi wahi taan hote hain aur malhar me bhi wahi , ang mere kehne ka matlab hai .

At another place , he mentions jo bhi gao sur me gao .
As a further indication of his humility , when it came to singing , he states one can not sing if he said he can sing , adding that only the blessings of the god and guru can enable one to sing .
Shyamanand Sinha believed that singing was the highest form of devotion and this reflected in his performances .
President Zakir Hussain , once when he was Governor of Bihar , was so moved by his performance that he embraced him stating that the Rajkumars singing was like praying to the almighty .
The Agra influence on his singing was most unmistakable .
But , as indciated above , he learnt from many others and developed his own unique style of singing .
Padmashri Gajendra Narayan Singh , former Chairperson of the Bihar Sangeet Natak Academy in his book Swar Gandhhas written that Kumar Shyamanand Singh of Banaili estate had such expertise in singing that many great singers including Kesarbai were convinced about his prowess in singing.In case you can not believe this please ask Pandit Jasraj .
After listening to Bandishes from Kumar Saheb , Jasraj was moved to tears and lamented that alas !
he could have such ability himself .
-LSB- http://girijanandsinha.blogspot.com/2008/11/banaili-roots-to-raj-continued-dynasty_3028.html .
Along with his singing prowess , his legendary voice made a tremendous mark on one and all who came in touch with him .
This included some great contemporary singers like Kesarbai Kerkar .
Kesarbai was visiting Champanagar for a performance and was so enthused by Rajkumars rendition of Dwarikanath Sharan Me Teri that she insisted politely that he teach the song to her .
She even expressed her readiness to make him her Guru for this song .
After some hesitation , as Kesarbai then was an acknowledged maestro and he still young and yet in his early days , he agreed to teach her the song .
Kesarbai sang this composition on a few occasions later and never forgot to acknowledge her Guru for the song .
His regular disciples included Shri Sitaram Jha , Kumar Jayanand Sinha , Saktinath Jha , Shankaranand Singh , Suryananranyan Jha , Girijanand Sinha , Udyanand Singh , Jayanta Chattopadhyay , Vandana Jha , Amar Nath Jha , Kaushal Kishore Dubey , Shyam Chaitanya Jha , Vijay Kumar Jha and Ram Sharan Sinha .
-LSB- http://girijanandsinha.blogspot.com/2008/11/banaili-roots-to-raj-continued-dynasty_3028.html .
Unfortunately , the excellence of his singing style and tradition did not survive his death though his influence stayed with some of his disciples who are striving hard to keep the flame burning in Purnia .
Not a professional musician , he sang for his own pleasure and which reflected in his singing .
He was prone to stop singing in the middle of a performances , whenever he felt mood was deserting him , saying ab tabyat nahi lagti bhai .
This made it difficult to plan a concert around him .
However , many of his admirers still managed to get him out for public performances in many places .
However , in general , he shunned music as a profession and never sought public recognition .
As mentioned earlier , he rarely gave public performances , most of his performances being during impromptu baithaks at his residence in Chamapanagar in the presence of his admirers and disciples .
Go and ask some of these who were fortunate to listen and they would narrate the experience in a daze as if re-visiting the emotion he generated when he sang .
Despite his strong reluctance for public acknowledgement , his followers conferred him with the title of Sangeet Bhaskar and Sangeet Sudhakar for his mastery in classical singing .
Shyamanand Sinha was also a great patron of classical music .
Ustad Vilayat Hussain Khan in his book Sangeetangyon ke Sansmaran has written : There is no better connoisseur and cognoscente of music in Bihar than Kumar Shyamanand Singh .
He was one of the chief patrons of the All India Music Conference and presented the convocation address at the 11th All India Music Conference of the The Prayag Sangit Samiti at Allahabadh on 19 December 1948 .
He used his great wealth to open the purse strings of patronage to many maestros of Hindustani Classical Music of his time at his residence in Champanagar , turning it into a place of learning and development of classical music .
Ustad Salamat Ali Khan -LSB- http://www.virsaonline.com/Articles/Articles%2004.htm , Ustad Altaf Hussain Khan of Khurja and Ustad Bachu Khan Sahib and many others were provided residence and patronage in Champanagar .
He also invited many great maestros for performances , among them were Aftab - e - Maushiqi Ustad Faiyaz Khan , Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , Ustad Mubarak Ali Khan , Ustad Nisaar Hussain Khan , Pandit D.V. Paluskar , Surshri Kesarbai Kerkar , Sawai Gandharva , Ustad Vilayat Hussain Khan , Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan , Ustad Altaf Hussain Khan of Khurja , Pandit Jasraj , Dilip Chand Vedi , Ustad Mushtaq Hussain Khan , Pandit Narayanrao Vyas , Pandit Basavaraj Rajguru , and Ustad Salamat Ali Khan and Nazakat Ali Khan -LSB- http://girijanandsinha.blogspot.com/2008/11/banaili-roots-to-raj-continued-dynasty_3028.html , Malang Khan , Allauddin Khan , Mushtaq Ali , Pandit Bholanath Bhatt , Pandit Chinmay Lahiri , Mahaveer Mullick , Jaduveer Mullick and Ramchatur Mallick.Ustad Yunus Hussian Khan refers to Raja Shyamanand Singh of Chamapanagar as having invited him to sing on the occasion of his sons marriage .
-LSB- http://www.agragharanarukavipa.org/artists/past/yunus_hussain_khan.htm .
It is narrated that , in 1944 , at the time of the Dasehra festival , he invited Usrad Salamat Ali Khan and Nazakat Ali Khan to perform at his palace .
Kumar Saheb was so enthused by the expert rendition of Raag Malkaus thst he would not allow them to leave Champanagar .
The boys and their father stayed as guests of the Rajkumar for nearly two months .
He also was responsible for sending them to All India Music Conference as his court musicians where they received wider recognition for the first time .
Pandit Channulal Mishra first performance as a young artiste was at Champanagar for Kumar Saheb .
After listening to him , Kumar Saheb wanted to keep the boy at Champanagar as his court musician .
Unfortunately , the few professional recordings done by All India Radio in the latter part of his life are untraceable .
Only a few amateur recordings of his singing are available with his family members and friends .
These are rare treasures and absolute delight for the senses .
They have somehow survived his idiosyncratic hatred for recording largely due to the efforts of his disciple nephew Kumar Girijanand Sinha , and lately by Kumar Girijanand Sinhas nephew , Santosh Jha .
Every year on his birth anniversary a classical musical programme is organised in Purnea in his memory .

Ustad Nasir Aminuddin Dagar was an Indian dhrupad singer in the dagar-vani style .
He is also remembered as the younger brother in the legendary jugalbandi or duo of Senior Dagar Brothers .
He along with his elder brother Ustad Nasir Moinuddin Dagar was responsible in reviving the dhrupad tradition that had fallen to a nadir after the death of their father Ustad Nasiruddin Khan Dagar .
Ustad Nasiruddin Khan had an early premonition of his own death and spend ten years training his two elder sons Moinuddin and Aminuddin so as to impart all his musical knowledge to them .
Subsequently after Ustad Nasiruddin Khans demise the two brothers trained under Ustad Riyazuddin Khan and Ustad Ziauddin Khan Dagar .
Young Aminuddin gave his first performance at the age of eleven .
It was however the 1940s that saw the meteoric rise of Moinuddin and Aminuddin as the Senior Dagar Brothers -- two of the brightest stars in the Dhrupad firmament .
Within themselves they not only transformed the art of Dhrupad singing but also breathed new life to the form of duet or jugalbandi singing .
Previously jugalbandi in the field of classical music had degenerated into a competition between the two singers where each tried to outdo the other in exhibitionism .
Moinuddin and Aminuddin on the other hand brought back the concept of a harmonious synchronization between the two singers .
In a typical performance by the Senior Dagar Brothers , the honey rich voice of Aminuddin will draw the audience into a deep meditative mood by gradually descending the notes of the lower octaves and Moinuddin would dazzle the listeners with his alankars or ornamentations in the upper octave .
After having established Dhrupad in a pedestal of glory in India , they were invited to perform abroad .
The two brothers visited Russia and Japan mezmerising the audience of both East and West with their divine music .
Their music proved to be so charming that Alain Danielou the renowned musicologist and the then director of UNESCO invited them to tour Europe and perform under the UNESCO banner in Berlin Venice and Paris .
In 1964 the European audience listened enthralled to their singing and newspaper after news paper declared the glory of Dhrupad and of the Senior Dagar Brothers .
A review of their performance published in Le Monde of Paris dated 17 November 1964 perhaps best expresses the mood of the western audience : '' ... we will remain under the deep impression of an art of such greatness and intensity that ... we feel touched and moved to the deepest of our being . ''
Ustad Nasir Moinuddin Dagar died soon after this concert in 1966 .
Aminuddin who had regarded his brother as his greatest guru and his father substitute was left completely devastated but he continued his journey as a solo performer .
The next phase of Aminuddins life unfolded in Kolkata where he came in January 1966 as the founder principal of Birla Academy Swar Sangam .
In 1975 he founded his own Dhrupad institute and named after his elder brother Ustad Nasir Moinuddin Dagar Dhrupad Sangeet Ashram .
He planned it as an Ashram where disciples will stay close to their guru and learn the subtle nuances of Dhrupad through the age old guru sishya parampara .
It is now the oldest surviving institute solely dedicated to the preservation and propagation of dagar-vani Dhrupad .
It is here that Aminuddin trained some of the best dhrupad singers of the next generation including Alaka Nandy , Ashoka Dhar , Sujata Moitra and Anu Burman .
Ustad Nasir Aminuddin dagar had been honoured with numerous awards and accolades .
Below is a list of some important awards that he received :

Mukherjeas musical education continued uninterrupted throughout his performing career , but there were periods during which he was not under the direct tutelage of a master .
These years spent in relative isolation from the Indian music scene , Mukherjea believes , contributed as much to his growth as a musician as did his formal training .

Mukherjeas contribution to music is considerable if unconventional .
He has been recognised as a pedagogue , theorist and performer of merit .
This recognition , however , has been sporadic in coming , although his own involvement with music remained fairly consistent across different stages of his life .
While at UCLA , Mukherjea served as an instructor of Hindustani instrumental music in the newly formed ethnomusicology department , and collaborated closely with Nazir Jairazbhoy in the early days of the program .
His students include Dr. Peter Manuel , Professor of Music at Hunter College , CUNY , who has acknowledged his debt to Mukherjea in several publications .
Mukherjea performances have been limited .
His 25-year span as a performing artist saw him play about fifty concerts in all .
It was entirely by chance that he encountered Lyle Wachovsky of India Archive Music , New York , who gave his music a global audience by publishing a full-length CD of Ragas Shuddha Kalyan and Shukla Bilawal .
Most of Mukherjeas concerts have been recorded , and if one manages to get past the often poor recording quality , he has much to offer to the connoisseur of Indian raga music .
Additionally , from 1983 to 1990 , Mukherjea was a regular broadcaster on All India Radio , Delhi .
While Kalyan was living in Los Angeles , his friend Jeffrey Pawlan made a high quality recording of Kalyan playing Piloo alap on the sarod on Sept. 22 , 1974 .
It is 10.5 minutes long .
This recording has now been digitized and will be available soon from the Rajan Parrikar Music Archive .
Mukherjeas music is difficult to categorise under usual taxonomic classifications .
While rooted in tradition , it does not rigidly adhere to convention .
His approach values logic and aesthetic sensitivity above other considerations .
A good example of this is his approach to interpreting the controversial Raga Shuddha Kalyan , which finds mention in an article by Deepak Raja on the issue .
In May 1995 , Mukherjeas musical career came to a sudden end , as he suffered a paralytic stroke , and lost mobility of the left side of his body .
Research in topology continued for a number of years , but waned eventually as Kalyans eyesight , already a matter of concern at the time of his stroke , began to deteriorate very rapidly into near-total visual impairment .
In the last phase of his life , Mukherjea led an active life for a person of his physical limitations .
He was deeply involved in the community of visually impaired computer users , and had assisted several such individuals in setting up the Audio Desktop of Emacspeak .
Additionally , he continued to play an inspirational role in the lives of a number of young mathematicians .
On the musical front , other than providing occasional guidance to other disciples of Radhika Mohan Maitras gharana , he nurtured a number of his own pupils , including Anirvan DuttaGupta and Arnab Chakrabarty .
One of Kalyans friends in Los Angeles was Jeffrey Pawlan .
After Kalyan moved back to India in 1976 , they lost track of each other .
Jeffrey reconnected via email and phone in January 2009 .
Here is additional information from an email that Kalyan wrote to Jeffrey on Jan. 25 , 2009 : .

The project also gives out the scope of featuring national and international musicians from time to time .
Yet , sweeter than the cooing nightingale is a sound .
You think only you can talk ?
Think again ... Silent voices ... voices of the raindrops nestling on the leaves of the Amazonian rain forest , the endless babble of a breathless river , the murmur of the broken wind ... sand , water , breeze , the voice is all over , all around .
Put your ears close to the earth ... you 'll hear the soil 's heart beat in all ... The sound of the soil is the quintessence of existence ... Nada ... Nada Brahmam ... the ` Param Braham ' .
The soil is who you 're .
It is from where you came , and it is where we will go .
The evening of 16 September is an echo of that voice .
It 's an evening where distance , time loose sense .
An evening of enchantment devoted to that one rhythm ... the rhythm of the heart and soul .
The rhythm of the ragas of the musician , the bells of the dancer , the words of the poet .
The evening begins with an invocation of that ` Sound of the soil ' ... The light of the lamp , the holy stotras and mantras , the mudras of the dancer shall evoke the Goddess of the Soil from whom we 're born .
The journey moves on with the magic of music ... the north and the south , Hindusthani and Carnatic coming close to each other to show it 's the same soil we 're born from and divisions are but man-made .
The mystic Sufi nostalgia of Baul & Fakirs singers will tell the story of the elements of the soil ... as will the clashing of the swords of Kalaripayattu speak of the vigour and strength with which Mother Earth holds us all .
The giddy strains of Manipur Khol players in between and the heady beats of Dhak at the end of the show will make us realize how different yet how similar can the .
understanding of the same soil be , and the words of the poet shall thread all these strains together showing the eternal quality of this voice ... The Sound of the soil ... one which connects the hearts beyond distance .

The Delhi Gharana is the oldest of all tabla gharanas , and is also the first to establish improvisation rules .
It was founded in North-East India , and is easily one of the most , if not the most , common Gharana used today , the Purbi Gharana also originates form the eastern areas of Delhi .
Delhi Gharana , the very first Gharana of Tabla , was founded in the early 18th century most probably by Mia Siddhar Khan Dhadi , who is often also referred to as the inventor of the Tabla , although it is debatable , as there have been similar pair-drums in ancient India called Pushkar Vadya .
Siddhar Khan is the earliest available name found in historical records .
Even mention of the instrument Tabla is not found earlier than Siddhar Khan .
Khan , having been a pakhawaj player , was responsible for incorporating pakhawaj bols to the style .
However , the tabla , not the pakhawaj , is now the main instrument of the Delhi Gharana .
Siddhar Khan and his descendants contributed greatly to the development of the Tabla language and compositional structures of the Peshkars and the Qaidas .
The Delhi tabla style is famous for its vast and rich repertoire of Qaidas .
Overall , the sound quality tends to focus on avoiding the overuse of loud , resonant baya strokes in favor of lighter , more precise strokes .
Bols such as dha , tete , terekete and tinnakena are prominent .
The temperament and style of playing is generally soft and esoteric .
A few notable masters of this school are Ustad Natthu Khan , Gamay Khan , his son Inam Ali Khan , Chatur Lal and Latif Ahmed Khan

Akhtari Bai Faizabadi or Begum Akhtar was a well known Indian singer of Ghazal , Dadra , and Thumri .
She received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for vocal music , and was awarded Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan by Govt .
of India .
She was given the title of Mallika-e-Ghazal .
Begum Akhtar was born in Bada Darwaza , Town Bhadarsa , Bharatkund , Faizabad District , Uttar Pradesh .
Her father , Asghar Hussain , a young lawyer who fell in love with her mother Mushtari and made her his second wife , subsequently disowned her and his twin daughters Zohra and Bibbi .
Akhtar was barely seven when she was captivated by the music of Chandra Bai , an artist attached to a touring theatre group .
However at her uncles insistence she was sent to train under Ustad Imdad Khan , the great sarangi exponent from Patna , and later under Ata Mohammed Khan of Patiala .
Later , she travelled to Calcutta with her mother and learnt music from classical stalwarts like Mohammad Khan , Abdul Waheed Khan of Lahore , and finally she became the disciple of Ustad Jhande Khan .
Her first public performance was at the age of fifteen .
The famous poetess , Sarojini Naidu , appreciated her singing during a concert which was organised in the aid of victims of a Bihar earthquake of 1934 .
This encouraged her to continue singing ghazals with more enthusiasm .
She cut her first disc for the Megaphone Record Company , at that time .
A number of gramophone records were released carrying her ghazals , dadras , thumris , etc. .
Begum Akhtars good looks and sensitive voice made her an ideal candidate for a film career in her early years .
When she heard great musicians like Gauhar Jan and Malak Jan , however , she decided to forsake the glamour of the film world for a career in Indian classical music .
Her supreme artistry in light classical music had its moorings in the tradition of pure classicism .
She chose her repertoire in primarily classical modes : a variety of raags , ranging from simple to complex .
After the advent of talkie era in India , Beghum Akhtar acted in a few Hindi movies in thirties .
East India Film Company of Calcutta approached her to act in King for a Day and Nal Damayanti in 1933 .
Like others of that era , she sang her songs herself in all her films .
She continued acting in the following years .
Subsequently Beghum Akhtar moved back to Lucknow where she was approached by the famous producer-director Mehboob Khan , as a result of which she acted in Roti which was released in 1942 and whose music was composed by maestro Anil Biswas .
Roti contained six of her ghazals but unfortunately due to some trouble between producer and director , Mehboob Khan subsequently deleted three or four ghazals from the film .
All the ghazals are available on Megaphone gramophone records .
Beghum Akhtar , meanwhile , left Bombay and returned to Lucknow .
In 1945 , Akhtaribai married a barrister , Ishtiaq Ahmed Abbasi , and became known as Begum Akhtar .
However , after marriage , due to her husbands restrictions , she could not sing for almost five years and subsequently , she fell ill , that is when her return to music was prescribed as a befitting remedy , and in 1949 she returned to the recording studios .
She sang three ghazals and a dadra at Lucknow Radio Station .
She wept afterwards and returned to singing in concerts , a practice that lasted until her death .
Her voice matured with time , adding richness and depth .
She sang ghazals and other light classical pieces , singing them in her inimitable style .
She has nearly four hundred songs to her credit .
She was a regular performer on All India Radio .
She usually composed her own ghazals and most of her compositions were raag based .
During her last concert in Ahmedabad she raised the pitch of her voice as she felt that her singing had not been as good as she had wanted it to be and she felt unwell .
The additional demand and stress that she put herself under resulted in her falling ill and was rushed to the hospital .
She died on October 30 , 1974 in the arms of Nilam Gamadia , her friend , who invited her to Ahmedabad , which has become her final performance .

Ustad Inayat Hussain Khan was the founder of this gharana .
The gharana find its origins in Ustad Mehboob Khan , the chief khayal singer the royal court of Rampur State , his tradition was followed by his son Ustad Inayat Hussain Khan and in turn by Inyats brother-in-laws , Ustad Haider Khan , and Padma Bhushan Ustad Mushtaq Hussain Khan -LRB- , thus all the singers were connected with each other , and gharana was named after their ancestral place , Sahaswan , in present Badaun district .
Amongst noted disciples of Padma Bhushan Ustad Mushtaq Hussain are Padma Shri Ustad Ghulam Sadiq Khan , married to his youngest daughter and associated with the Music department of the Delhi University , Sulochana Brahaspati , Sumati Mutatkar , Shanno Khurana and Naina Devi .
Inayat Khan was a child prodigy , and his first married the daughter of Haddu Khan of the Gwalior gharana , and took talim from Ustad Bahadur Hussain Khan , a descendant of Mian Tansen himself .
The style has influences of the Dhrupad singing typical of the Gwalior gharana , and the Rampur-Shahaswan style is sometimes regarded as an off-shoot of the Gwalior gharana .
The Rampur-Sahaswan gayaki is closely related to the Gwalior Gharana , which features medium-slow tempos , a full-throated voice and intricate rhythmic play .
The gharana style is also known for the diversity and intricacy of the taans , as well as tarana singing .
The renowned singers of this gharana include the first and , perhaps the foremost disciple of Ustad Inayat Hussain Khan , Ustad Hyder Khan sahab .
In fact , Ustad Hyder Khan and his family plays a vital role in upbringing the legacy of this illustrious family as , not only him but , after his demise , his son Ustad Fida Hussain Khan and his grandson , the renowned maestro Padma Bhushan Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan made sure that the legacy carries forward to the next generation .
Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan was not just a singer but a great teacher who has given the gharana what it has in the modern era .
Also , another legendary singer of this gharana is Padma Bhushan Ustad Mushtaq Hussain Khan , who was a disciple of Ustad Hyder Khan and later on , groomed by Ustad Inayat Hussain Khan sahab .
He was the recipient of the first Padma Bhushan award in singing .
Belonging to the family of the gharana are the disciples and relatives of Padma Bhushan Ustad Mushtaq Hussain Khan Sahab , one of the other pioneers of the gharana .
His family consists of his sons , Ustad Ishtiyaaq Hussain Khan , Ustaad Is-haaq Hussain Khan , Ustad Ghulam Hussain Khan , Ustaad Ghulam Abid Khan , Ustad Ghulam Taqi Khan !
, Ustad Wajid Husain khan , Ustad Jafar Hussain Khan Badayuni , Ustad Afzal Hussain Niazami,son-in-law Ustad Ghulam Sadiq Khan , Ustad Ghulam Nizam-ud-deen Khan , Ustaad Ghulam Fareed-ud-deen Khan , Ustaad Shujaat Hussain Khan , Ustaad Sakhawat Hussain Khan , Ustaad Shehzad Hussain Khan , Ustaad Maqbool Hussain Khan , Ustaad Muhammad Ahmed Khan , Ustad Ghulam Siraj Khan , Ustad Ghulam Abbas Khan , Ghulam Naqi Khan , Ghulam Rasool Khan , Ghulam Habib Khan , Naushad Ali Khan , Ghulam Azeez Khan , Usama Khan Niazi , Zeashaan khan , Salman Khan Niazi , Ghulam Fakhr-ud-deen Khan , Amir Khan , Areeb Khan Niazi , Ghulam Hasan Khan , Muneer Khan Niazi , Mushtaq Hasan Khan and the youngest Classical singer of the gharana Master Mehndi Hasan Niazi .
Belonging to the other family of the same gharana are also the desciples and releatives of Padma Bhushan Ustad Mushtaq Hussain khan .
Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan gave some of the best exponents in the field of Indian Classical Music such as Ustad Hafeez Ahmed Khan , Ustad Sarfaraz Hussain Khan , Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan , Ustad Iftikhar Hussain Khan Ustad Ghulam Akbar Khan , Zulfiqar Hussain Khan , Ateeq Hussain Khan , Ustad Rashid Khan , Ustad Mujahid Hussain Khan , Mushahid Hussain Khan and Wajahat Hussain Khan and Ghulam Niyaz Khan .
Also belonging to the same lineage are Ustad Aftab Ahmed Khan , Ghulam Qadir Khan , Ghulam Murtuza Khan , Nadeem Khan , Danish Hussain Khan , Azeem Khan , Shazeb Hasan , Arshad Khan , Rizwan Khan and Shahbaaz Hussain .
Apparently , there were artists who came in and learned under the able guidance of these legends of Rampur Sahaswan Gharana such as Chajju Khan and Nazir Khan , Pandit Ganpat Rao , Ustad Hafeez Khan of Gudiyani .
Some other famous names in the same category of musicians who came from elsewhere and learned in Rampur Sahaswan Gharana are Shanno Khurana , Sulochana Brihaspati , Arun Bhaduri , Deepak Chatterjee , Pradeep Chatterjee , Pranab Biswas , Prasad Kharpade , Chandan Das , A.Hariharan , Sonu Nigam and Shaan , to name a few .
In 2006 , Dr Sakuntala Narasimhan , herself a disciple of Ustad Hafeez Ahmed Khan , published a book on the Rampur-Sahaswan gharana titled , The Splendour of Rampur-Sahaswan Gharana

The Indian santoor is an ancient string musical instrument native to Jammu and Kashmir , with origins in Persia .
A primitive ancestor of this type of instruments was invented in Mesopotamia .
The santoor is a trapezoid - shaped hammered dulcimer often made of walnut , with seventy two strings .
The special-shaped mallets are lightweight and are held between the index and middle fingers .
A typical santoor has two sets of bridges , providing a range of three octaves .
The Indian santoor is more rectangular and can have more strings than the Persian counterpart , which generally has 72 strings .
In ancient Sanskrit texts , it has been referred to as shatatantri vina .
In India , the santoor was used as an accompaniment instrument to the folk music of Kashmir .
It is played in a style of music known as the Sufiana Mausiqi .
The Sufi mystics used it as an accompaniment to their hymns .
The trapezoid framework is generally made out of either walnut or maple wood .
The top and bottom boards sometimes can be either plywood or veneer .
On the top board , also known as sound board , wooden bridges are placed , in order to seat stretched metal strings across .
The strings , grouped in units of 3 or 4 , are tied on nails or pins on the left side of the instrument and are stretched over the sound board on top of the bridges to the right side .
On the right side there are steel tuning pegs or tuning pins , as they are commonly known , that allows tuning each unit of strings to a desired musical note or a frequency or a pitch .
The santoor is played while sitting in an asana called ardha-padmasana position and placing it on top of the lap .
While playing , the broad side is closer to the waist of the musician and the shorter side is away from the musician .
It is played with a pair of light wooden mallets or hammers with both hands .
The santoor is a very delicate instrument and is very sensitive to light strokes and glides .
The strokes are played always on the strings either closer to the bridges or a little away from bridges .
Both styles result in different tones .
Sometimes strokes by one hand can be muffled by the other hand by using the face of the palm just to create variety
Kamalesh Maitra , often referred to by the title Pandit , was an Indian classical musician , composer and teacher .
He is recognised as the last master of the tabla tarang - a melodic percussion instrument consisting of numerous individually tuned hand drums , set in a semicircle .
Maitra grew up in Calcutta and played the tabla until joining Uday Shankar s ballet company in 1950 and taking up the tabla tarang .
He became the companys musical director and toured internationally with the troupe through to the mid 1970s .
Along with Alla Rakha , Shivkumar Sharma , Hariprasad Chaurasia and others , Maitra was among the musicians that Ravi Shankar selected for his Music Festival from India revue in 1974 .
He then accompanied Shankar on ex - Beatle George Harrison s North American tour that year - a venture that led to him performing with American jazz musicians Emil Richards and Tom Scott .
Maitra settled in Berlin in 1977 , where he performed and worked as a music teacher .
In 1980 , he formed the Ragatala Ensemble , an orchestra that fused elements of Indian and European classical music with jazz and other Western genres .
Among his recordings , Tabla Tarang - Melody on Drums has received critical acclaim , one reviewer describing it as a milestone in world music .
Maitra developed strong cultural ties with Berlin and continued to live and work in Germany until his death in 2005 .
Kamalesh Maitra was born in Tangail in East Bengal in 1928 .
and the family lacked the musical lineage commonly associated with Hindustani classical music .
Maitra spent his formative years in Calcutta , absorbing much of the European influence on the city .
At the age of twelve , he began playing a variety of hand drums , including tabla .
In 1950 , Maitra joined Uday Shankar s ballet and dance company , as master drummer .
Having established himself as a tabla player , he was asked to master the tabla tarang , an instrument made up of between ten and sixteen tablas , specifically the treble-variety dayan .
With each hand drum tuned to a different pitch , producing a range of roughly one and a half octaves , Maitra was able to provide a combined melodic-rhythmic role in performances of ragas or ballet and dance compositions .
While developing the potential of the tabla tarang , he continued his advanced musical studies , learning the lute-like sarod under the tutelage of Ali Akbar Khan .
From 1955 , Maitra was musical director of Shankars troupe , for whom he composed and directed music for a wide range of stage productions .
During a period of over twenty years , he toured the United States , China , Africa and Europe with the company .
In 1974 , Udays brother Ravi Shankar invited Maitra to join his Music Festival from India revue , sponsored by former Beatle George Harrison , a champion of Indian classical music in the West .
Maitras fellow performers included internationally acclaimed musicians such as Alla Rakha , Lakshmi Shankar , Shivkumar Sharma , Hariprasad Chaurasia , Sultan Khan and L. Subramaniam .
Maitra recorded a studio album in England with the Music Festival orchestra - released in 1976 on Dark Horse Records - contributing on tabla tarang , sarod and ektara , before they all undertook a short European tour .
The Music Festival from Indias debut performance , filmed at Londons Royal Albert Hall on 23 September 1974 , was released on DVD in 2010 , as part of the four-disc box set Ravi Shankar-George Harrison , Collaborations .
Maitra then joined the Music Festival personnel for Harrisons North American tour in November-December 1974 , performing in the more jazz - inflected style of Shankars Shankar Family & Friends crossover album .
In keeping with Shankars efforts to elevate the status of Indian percussionists , Maitra combined with Rakha , T.V. Gopalkrishnan and Rijram Desad in extended , four-way drum soloing - the highlight of their set , and a source of fascination for Harrisons rock drummers Jim Keltner and Andy Newmark .
For the finale to the Indian portion of each concert , Maitra and the rest of Shankars ensemble played with Harrisons entire band , which also included jazz percussionist Emil Richards and saxophonist Tom Scott .
Long interested in the possibilities of Indo-European musical fusion , Maitra performed at the 1976 Meta-Music Festival in Berlin , in what was then West Germany .
After moving to Berlin the following year , he began teaching Indian classical instrumentation , and in 1980 formed the Ragatala Ensemble with some of his students .
In 2003 , Germanys House of World Cultures website wrote of Maitras music with the Ragatala Ensemble : The group has enabled him to fulfil his old dream of having his compositions played by a mixed European-Indian orchestra .
The pieces follow the rules of classical Indian music but are deliberately fused with elements of European classical music , jazz and new music .
Among his subsequent projects , from 1983 to 1988 Maitra participated in the Nada Brahma - the Whole World is Sound initiative by Joachim-Ernst Berendt ; in 1992 , as part of Berlins Indian Festival , his orchestral works were performed at the HKW ; and in 2000 he contributed to Festival of Vision - Berlin in Hong Kong .
He worked again with Shankar on the soundtrack to the film Genesis , recorded in Paris .
In his 1997 autobiography , Raga Mala , Shankar describes Maitra as an extremely versatile musician , while the Boston Phoenix once said of his playing : far from an eccentric novelty , is simply one of the great drummers of India to record in this century .
He also worked with Charlie Mariano , an American saxophonist who similarly relocated to Europe during the 1970s , and Israeli clarinetist Giora Feidman .
Among Maitras many recordings , starting with Tabla Tarang - Magnificent Percussion of India for HMV India , in 1993 he released Masters of Raga : Kamalesh Maitra on Germanys Wergo record label .
The album features tabla accompaniment from Kumar Bose .
The following year , the Gramophone Company of India issued The Voice of Sarod from the Strokes of Drums - Tabla Tarang by Kamalesh Maitra , on which he played three ragas accompanied by Rakhas son Fazal Qureshi on tabla and Laura Patchen on tambura .
This was followed in 1996 by Tabla Tarang - Melody on Drums , issued in America by Smithsonian Folkways .
in November 1993 , contains a performance of Raga Charukeshi on which music critic Ken Hunt praises Maitras playing as phenomenal .
In September 2000 , Maitra was awarded the Musicale Vitale prize at Berlins Werkstatt der Kulturen festival .
He continued to perform and record with the Ragatala Ensemble until 2003 , the same year that he premiered his final orchestral work , Raag Symphonia , in Berlin .
Maitra died on 22 April 2005 , aged 76 , in Kreischa , near the German city of Dresden .
Hunt describes him as a master musician and attributes much of his musical vision to the pioneering spirit of Uday Shankar , who painted the backdrops against which many trained musicians learned to deliver traditional music in a new age for people with no grounding or appreciation of traditional styles of dance or music .
Maitra is commonly referred to as the last master of the comparatively rare tabla tarang

Balakrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar was an Indian vocalist of Khayal - genre of Hindustani classical music .
He learnt under Gwalior gharana , and brought its singing style to Maharashtra , also became the founder of Khayal music in Maharashtra .
Balakrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar was born in Maharashtra .
He travelled to Gwalior , then Mecca of Khayal style in Indian Classical Music , and learned under Vasudeorao Joshi .
He then returned to Maharashtra , and settled near Miraj because its climate suited him .
Soon Miraj and the area near it became a major hub of Hindustani classical music and has remained so for more than 100 years .
It is a combination o conducive cultural climate , the aptitude shown for classical music by people in the area , and tireless efforts of teachers among whom Balakrishnabuwa , being the first to bring the gayaki to western India , deserves to be put on a special pedestal .
Buwas slow , majestic singing was marked by gravitas .
His chief disciples include Vishnu Digambar Paluskar , his own son Annabuwa , Anant Manohar Joshi , Mirashi buwa and Vamanbuwa Chafekar .
Annabuwa predeceased him .
His sons death caused him great sadness in his final years .
While he had some reservations about his disciple Paluskars efforts towards popularising music , Paluskar played a major role in expanding appeal of classical music to common folks .
Most other styles of singing have had their origins in Gwalior Gharana because it was among the earliest styles to take root and enjoy wider popularity
Bharat Gupt , A retired Associate Professor in English , who taught at the College of Vocational Studies of the University of Delhi , is an Indian classicist , theatre theorist , sitar and surbahar player , musicologist , cultural analyst , and newspaper columnist .
Bharat Gupt was born on 28 November 1946 in Moradabad , a small city of mixed Hindu-Muslim population , known for Hindustani music and Urdu poetry .
His parents moved in the early 50s to Delhi where he went to school and college and studied English , Hindi , Sanskrit and philosophy , spending , however , every summer in the district town .
He then spent a year in the US at the end of Counter-Cultural days , in the late 1960s ; then he moved to Canada and took a Masters degree from Toronto .
Back in India , he learnt to play the sitar and surbahar , training for eight years under the eminent musician Pandit Uma Shankar Mishra .
He also studied ancient Indian musicological texts and modern Indian Music , yoga sutras and classics under Acharya K.C. Brihaspati and Swami Kripalvananda .
Doctoral Dissertation : A Comparison of Greek and Indian Dramatic Theories as Given in the Poetics and the Natyasastra .
Trained both in modern European and traditional Indian educational systems , he has worked in classical studies , theatre , music , culture and media studies and researched as Senior Fellow of the Onassis Foundation in Greece on revival of ancient Greek theatre .
As a classicist I came to realise that ancient Greek drama and culture as a whole , was given an unduly empirical color by the modern West .
Looking at things from my own location I saw that Greek theatre was closer to ancient Indian theatre as an ethical and religious act or hieropraxis .
Instead of being seen as Western and Eastern , Greek and Indian theatres should be seen rooted in the Indo-European cultural beliefs , myths and idolatory and the aesthetics of emotional arousal .
After his graduation , a series of grants and programs enabled him to pursue his cultural interests : .
In 1995 he was also a member of the Jury for the International Onasis Prize for Drama .
He is Associate Professor of English at College of Vocational Studies , University of Delhi and is on visiting faculty at the National School of Drama , Delhi .
From 1995 to this day he has made numerous and extensive lecture tours , speaking on theatre and music at various Universities in India , North America and Greece , a country he loves deeply and visits at least once a year .
He has also directed major lectures and directed seminars .
As part of his research material he has made about 2000 photographs of amphitheaters and antiquities all over Greece as well as in Syracuse , Italy .
He writes for research journals and national newspapers on cultural and educational issues .
As a reviewer , he is a frequent contributor to Journal of Sangeet Natak Academy , Journal of Music Academy Madras , Indian Musicological Society , Baroda .
His practical involvement with traditional Indian temple architecture resulted in initiating the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ashok Vihar its a nagar style stone temple with carvings which will give Delhi a traditional temple after a millennium .
In 2001 , he was one of the founding members of the International Forum for Indias heritage : a non-religious , non-ideological , apolitical body , IFIH is a network of scholars , educationists , artists , scientists , social workers , environmentalists , thinkers and writers , who have come together to promote India 's cultural heritage .
In 1976 , he married Yukti , and the couple had two sons : Abhinav and Udayan .
In August 2010 he became the grandfather of a boy named Atharva , after the 4th Veda .
He retired from the University of Delhi in Nov. 2011 but continues to lecture at other forums .
Much of his writing is devoted to classical Indian and classical Greek drama , comparing their similarities and differences and exploring the possibilities of common Indo-European origins .
His first book , Dramatic Concepts - Greek and Indian , was directly inspired by his Greek travels and studies .
This study offers a fresh approach in comparing ancient Greek and Indian dramatic theories .
Instead of treating the Poetics and the Natyashastra as Western and Eastern viewpoints , it places them within the broad framework of ancient Indo-European culture and the art of sacred drama .
It demonstrates that hieropraxis was basically different from post-Renaissance European drama which was entirely secular in content and Realistic in presentation .
The Poetics and the Natyashastra on the contrary , belonged to theatres which pleased both gods and men , and which used semiotised gesture , dance , music , and dialogue to create a highly ornate theatrical reality .
The book aims at comparing not only the concepts as propounded by Aristotle and Bharata Muni , but also attempts to reconstruct the Greek and Indian performances to highlight their similarities and differences .
Concepts like anukarana , dharmi , abhinaya , itivritta , mimesis , muthos , melopoiia , katharsis and rasa , etc. , as revisited and expounded here , can be seen as means of creating dramatic shows which go beyond message and entertainment to provide sublimer experiences .
Although it is rare to find a comparative treatment of Greek and Sanskrit drama as thoughtful and passionate as this one , students of classical Indian theater will recognize a familiar topic in the title .
Gupt asserts that examining genres cross-culturally can only lead to dead ends because literary genres are culturally and historically unique ; instead , a comparison of performance modes is likely to be more illuminative .
One of the books strengths is the detailed comparative description of the ritual roots of theater in the Indo-European cultures of ancient Greece and India All in all , this work does represent the most thorough study in this particular critical genre , and if Gupts engaging idiosyncrasies can be acknowledged , the book will succeed in fostering an appreciation of Sanskrit literature for those who commit to reading the texts he discusses , even in translation .
DAVID L. GITOMER , Comparative Drama , Kalamazoo .
Fall 1997 .
And excerpts from another review , by Richard Schechner , TDR .
Gupt argues that rasa , the juice or essence of the theatrical-aesthetic pleasure experience , is comparable to katharsis : Katharsis should not be viewed as mere relief , it could better be regarded as restoration to a state of pleasure not generally experienced the process of rasa emergence requires the removal of obstructions -LSB- ... Katharsis and rasa , with their separate points of emphasis , both begin with purification and end in delight .
272-73 This is an insight not previously proposed by anyone , a definite advance in performance theory .
However much his book has been about ancient practices and theories , Gupt concludes his study looking forward : The vision of ancient hieropraxis which represents a balance of various media of theatrical communication , can be extremely useful .
The harmonious use of the visual gestural , symbolic , and kinetic and the aural spoken , sung , and musical as achieved in ancient drama , and as exemplified in the dramatic theories of Greece and India , has many a lesson for the present day world theatre .
The lesson , according to Gupt , is to suggest a codified alternative which can be offered as a stable and distinct alternative to commercial realism which continues to dominate modern theatre , both in the West and India .
Gupts book is important , examining in depth questions often raised but rarely pursued .
Frequently , those making comparative studies are more knowledgeable about one side or the other .
Radical assertions concerning Indo-European or Eurasian theatre are in the air but rarely brought down to the scholarly earth .
Gupt knows both the Indian and the Greek ancient theatre ; his book is full of details , provocative in the best sense , theoretical without losing touch with concrete data , and despite the difficulty of its subject , easy to read .
Dramatic Concepts Greek and Indian ought to be an assigned textfor courses , some existing , most waiting to be taught , comparing ancient Indian and Greek theatres and performance theories .

Then followed the translation of the 28th chapter of the Natyashastra , devoted to the musical scales .
This translation of the text includes the translation of the Sanskrit commentary of Achaarya KCD Brihaspati , a leading musicologist of modern times and Gupts teacher , who presents an original interpretation of the sloka , although he often makes reference to earlier contributions of the sage Abhinavagupta .
it is sometimes argued that presents a music meant for theatre and not for the independent art .
This controversy is a creation of the post-industrial era in India , when as in the West , the relationship of music with poetry , dance , painting and sculpture was ruptured .
Such issues , however , have been raised in the world of Indian music only .
In literary studies , with a better formal tradition of critical training , nobody has ever raised the question whether the metres given in the two chapters of the Natyasastra are meant for theatrical employment or for literary use ... The twenty-eighth chapter of the Natyasastra limits itself to the employment of notes or svaras in music .
It begins with an announcement , I shall now enunciate the rules relating to the playing of instruments .
But we are soon told that the human body is also an instrument , thus covering vocal music in the ambit of atodyavidhi .
For the ancients , pada or song was the beginning of music , strings were the middle and drumming was the end .
Music as merely notes and rhythm , svara and tala , was inconceivable .
The instruments emulated the human voice and the drums followed its rhythmic statement .
This pattern obtains even now in Indian music .
The post-Renaissance European concept of music as instrumental tonal orchestration has deprivileged the verbal composition , as a result of which , there is a revision in the concept of music even in traditional societies .
this is a book that greatly advances our understanding of ancient Indian music .
It should be part of the library of any music theorist or musicologist with an interest in the historical development of gandharva , the term used by the NS for the musical art .
Because of its combination of the original text with a translation and a new commentary , and due to its generally lucid treatment of the subject matter , the book has definite advantages over its predecessors .
Bharat Gupt is to be congratulated for bringing out this ancient masterpiece in a publication that is both readable and highly informative .
India - A Culture Decline Or Revival ?
, a book published in 2008 , critically analyses the state of affairs in India after the British left in 1947 and examines whether Independence has ushered an era of cultural and social freedom or a cultural decline has set in -- a thought-provoking subject .
It is often taken for granted that Independence from the British rule also ushered an era of cultural and social freedom in India .
The author wishes to examine if that is true or if a cultural decline set in soon after .
Based on a verse in the Pancatantra , the book has been divided into six parts : Eka , Kula , Grama , Janapada , Prithvi and Atma .
Issues of education ; conflicts between the classes , regions , jatis , languages and religions ; expansion of proselytizers ; lack of governance ; tensions between the legislators and judiciary ; rise of unbridled consumerism ; falling standards of democracy ; dilemmas created by notions of dharma challenged by Westernized modernity ; and the problems of attaining universal harmony , are all put into a perspective under these six categories .
While examining the state of affairs the author also suggests a way for the pursuit of happiness through unselfish transcendence .
It is further imagined that in spite of its poverty , India is admired by the richer nations of the West as a culturally evolved nation .
This self-congratulation , lingering from the euphoric days of our freedom struggle , sounds now like the thunder on distant mountains shedding not a glimmer of hope on our present lives .
For most of us our memory is enough to be a lived-through account of the cultural decline that set in barely within a decade after freedom .
Any analysis is sufficient to counter the smug belief , still fostered in schools and political speeches about the superiority of our culture , once voiced in Iqbals song , Saare Jahaan se acchaa Hindustan hamaaraa .
Very insidiously this rhyme nurses a misplaced conviction that while many other ancient civilizations were wiped out in time , India alone is indestructible ... The song takes special pride in stating that while the Greek and Roman civilizations , the so-called predecessors of the West , lost to ravages of time , Indian civilization alone remains immortal .
Bharat Gupt is a vocal activist for the revival of Indian Heritage and its comeback in the educational system .
The following is an excerpt from his polemic article Who is afraid of Sanscrit ?
: .
India alone excels in belittling its classical heritage as it has unfortunately codified it as its `` Hindu past .
This classification began in the colonial period when non-European cultures were primarily seen in religious denominations as non-Christian coloured races further divided into two broad categories , primitives or static cultures .
Within the western world these approaches were countered first by Orientalists and later by Modernists , both opponents of Newtonian rationalism .
But while the Orientalist contributed to the discovery of the East by the West , they also succeeded in creating a somnambulist reassurance in the minds of many Indians who never tire of revelling in praises of India by Schopenhauer , Max Muller , Blavatsky , Whitman and the like .
In spite of the Orientalists , administrators like Macaulay forged for India an education system which had little or marginal place , not only for Sanskrit literature , but for all the traditional arts and sciences like music , poetry , dance , theatre and painting , Ayurveda , Rasayan , Jyotisha , metrics , etc. .
This dichotomy continued well into the semi-century of independence and flourishes strong as ever .
In the book Globalization & identity : cultural diversity , religion , and citizenship by Majid Teranian & B. Jeannie Lum , editors -RRB- , where Gupt contributed the essay Religious plurality in education , passionately arguing that religious - multi-religious - education should come back to schools , in order to promote understanding of other faiths .
The editors note , in the introduction : .
Gupt provides several recommendations for the transformation of Indias school system in teaching the Heritage Curriculum as Heritage Activity that incorporates many of the activity-based modes of instruction we associate with progressive education .

Tim Reynolds is a Grammy nominated multi-instrumentalist known as both a solo artist and as a lead guitarist for the Dave Matthews Band .
One reviewer has declared Reynolds an under-rated master .
Reynolds plays the guitar , piano , sitar , drums , violin , bass , keyboards , ethnic percussive instruments , solo djembe , harp , uses drum machines for special effects , and sings , although his performances are primarily instrumental rock music .
As well as being the founding member of the band TR3 , he is one of the musicians who performed at Millers , in Charlottesville Virginia , befriending and encouraging the bartender , a young Dave Matthews , to form a band of his own , introducing him to local musicians , several of whom make up the Dave Matthews Band .
While Reynolds declined the offer to join as an official member , he recorded and toured as a sideman with the Dave Matthews Band from its inception until late 1998 , rejoining them as a permanent member in June 2008 .
He often tours with Dave Matthews as an acoustic duo , in addition to performing as a member of Dave Matthews & Friends .
Reynolds was born in Wiesbaden , Germany , where his father , a career military man , was stationed .
He says he hails from nowhere , because the family moved so often .
Some of the places the family lived include Germany , a farm in Indiana , then on an army base in Alaska , then to Kansas , then to Missouri , where he lived longer than any other place until he was old enough to move away as an adult .
Both parents were extremely devout Christians and he says he grew up with Christian music all around him .
However , his older sister owned some albums from The Beatles , which he says , even as a very young child , he loved instantly , playing air guitar to their music .
Upon reaching adolescence , Reynolds was able to learn guitar and electric bass guitar , so he could perform in the familys local Church choir three times a week , with the secret added bonus that he was able to begin experimenting with learning what eventually became second nature ; adding riffs infused with rock and roll , funk and soul music by the age of twelve .
Upon graduation from high school , he moved away from home , and after moving from the Midwestern States , landed in Charlottesville , Virginia , finding jazz , jazz fusion , and experimental music enthusiasts there .
Reynolds found the college town a more welcoming environment for him to branch out musically there than in any of his previous homes , and added to his experimentation other musical influences to his repertoire , including sixties psychedelic rock , citing some of his early influences as Jimi Hendrix , Carlos Santana and Led Zeppelin .
By the 1990s , he had formed the Tim Reynolds Three or TR3 , and had added other influences to his repertoire ; music from Nine Inch Nails , Bob Marley and Marilyn Manson .
In addition , he continued to learn to play other instruments , including the sitar , sarod , the mandello , keytar , tubular bells and other exotic instruments that are not commonly seen in Western rock artists of the rock and roll musicians of the time .
Reynolds was performing in Charlottesville in the late 1980s when his old college roommate , Nic Cappon , encouraged him to perform at a local bar , Millers , where he met bartender Dave Matthews .
Reynolds explains : I played there in Charlottesville all the time .
Dave Matthews was the bartender .
I knew the rest of his band way before that .
We played together in Charlottesville since I moved there in 1981 .
I would play with LeRoi Moore and Carter Beauford .
Dave moved to town in 1987 .
When the Dave Matthews Band started , I already had my own band .
I told him , `` Ive got a band and I kind of like the way it is .
You should start your band .
I could see that he needed to do his own thing .
In 1993 , Reynolds and Dave Matthews started playing a few acoustic duo sets .
These featured Matthews music , stripped down to just the acoustic guitar , paired with Reynoldss guitar , and Reynolds occasional use of slide guitar .
During these sets , Reynolds would play between one to four of his own pieces that spanned his own catalog of work .
After a few years these shows gained popularity , and in 1996 Matthews and Reynolds embarked on their first full tour together as a duo .
In 1999 , coinciding with the release of the 40-date tour , Live at Luther College was released .
After a short break , Reynolds toured again with Matthews as a duo in 2003 .
Reynolds and Matthews then reprised their duo shows as an opening act for the Dave Matthews & Friends tour in 2003 and early 2004 .
They played several shows together in 2006 and 2007 .
Reynolds joined Matthews on a mini-tour of Europe in February and March 2007 .
On August 14 , 2007 , Matthews and Reynolds released a live CD/DVD set , Live at Radio City , including the songs Stay or Leave , Gravedigger , Cornbread , and Dancing Nancies , among others .
It also includes two of Reynolds own songs ; You are My Sanity and Betrayal .
The Radio City show was also released in high definition on Blu-ray Disc .
In 2008 , Reynolds once again joined Dave Matthews Band for the recording Big Whiskey and the Groogrux King with producer Rob Cavallo .
It was Reynoldss first recording collaboration with Matthews since 2003s Some Devil and his first with the Dave Matthews Band since 1998s Before These Crowded Streets .
Reynolds and Matthews performed together several times in April 2008 : in support of Presidential candidate Barack Obama , at the Seeds of Compassion show in Seattle , Washington , and at Jack Johnson s Kokua Festival at the Waikiki Shell on the island of Oahu , in Honolulu , Hawaii .
Reynolds toured as lead guitarist with the Dave Matthews Band in support of Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King in early 2008 .
As of the summer tour of 2013 , he is still a full time member of the Dave Matthews Band .
Following the release of Dave Matthews first solo album , Some Devil , Matthews brought together many of the albums collaborators and embarked on a small winter 2003/2004 U.S. tour .
The group consisted of Trey Anastasio on guitar , Brady Blade on drums , Tony Hall on bass , Ray Paczkowski on keys , and Reynolds on guitar .
Each show opened with a small acoustic Matthews and Reynolds set , and then followed with the full band set with Reynolds performing on electric guitar .
Most of Some Devil was played live that tour , along with a wide variety of covers , including , by Reynolds request , Peter Gabriel s hit Solsbury Hill .
Dave Matthews & Friends performed occasional shows again in 2004 , 2005 , and 2006 .
In 2008 , Reynolds joined Dave Matthews Band on their summer North American tour , and scheduled to rejoin them on their Spring 2009 North American tour .
Both Matthews and Reynolds have an open taping policy that additionally extends to TR3 , which is available on his website .
The pair contend that no two concerts are alike , due in great part to Reynolds inspired exploration of the melody on stage .
Reynolds and Matthews performed on a 2008 album called Songs for Tibet , an initiative to support Tibet , Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso and to underline the human rights violations allegedlly committed against Tibet by China .
On Oct. 4 2009 Reynolds performed with Matthews in St. Louis , Missouri to support Farm Aid in 2009 .

The shehnai , shahnai , shenai or mangal vadya , is a double reed oboe , common in India , Pakistan , Bangladesh and Iran , made out of wood , with a metal flare bell at the end .
Its sound is thought to create and maintain a sense of auspiciousness and sanctity and , as a result , is widely used during marriages , processions , and in temples , although it is also played in concerts .
Shenai is similar to South India s nadaswaram .
This tubular instrument gradually broadens towards the lower end .
It usually has between six and nine holes .
It employs one set of quadruple reeds , making it a quadruple reed woodwind .
By controlling the breath , various tunes can be played on it .
The shehnai has a range of two octaves , from the A below middle C to the A one line above the treble clef .
The ancestor of North Indian shehnai is believed to be from Persian Surna .
The shehnai is thought to have been developed by improving upon the pungi .
There are varying legends of the shehnais origin .
In one of these , a shah initially banned the playing of the pungi in his court due to its shrill sound .
A barber , belonging to a family of musicians , improved on it and created the shehnai .
As it was played in the Shahs court and giving due reference to the nai or barber , the new instrument was called shehnai .
Another theory of the origin of the shehnai is that the name is a modification of the word sur-nal .
The word nal/nali/nad is used in many Indian languages to mean pipe or reed .
The word sur means tone or tune -- musical note or simply music -- and is used as a prefix to the names of many Indian instruments .
The sur-nal is said to have given its name to the surna/zurna which is the name by which the reed-pipe is known throughout the Middle East and eastern Europe .
Shehnai is usually played at traditional North Indian weddings and is associated with the bride leaving her parental house for her husbands house .
Sometimes , two shehnais can be tied together , making it a double shawm similar to the ancient Greek aulos .
Whereas the counterparts played in West Indian and Coastal Karnatka are indigenous to the territory .
Shenai players were/are an integral part of Goan/Konkani and temples along the western coast and the players are called as Vajantri and they were alloted lands for services rendered for the temples

The Gwalior Gharana is one of the oldest Khyal Gharanas .
The rise of the Gwalior Gharana started with the reign of the great Mughal emperor Akbar .
The favorite singers of this patron of the arts , such as Miyan Tansen , first amongst the vocalists at the court , came from the town of Gwalior .
During the time of Mughal kings Ustad Nathan Pir Bakhsh and his maternal grandsons were the legendary Haddu , Hassu and Nathu Khan .
The main musician in the court at the time was Ustad Bade Mohammad Khan who was famous for his taanbaazi .
Both Ustad Bade Mohammad Khan and Ustad Nathan Pir Bakhsh belonged to the same tradition of Shahi Sadarang .
Some sources believe that Ustad Nathan Pir Bakhsh settled in Gwalior and evolved the style features that led to this gharana .
Others claim that individuals named Nathan Pir Bakhsh and Nathu Khan founded the gharana .
The accepted version is that Nathan Pir Baksh left Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh to escape the professional rivalry with Ustad Shakkar Khan that had taken an ugly turn .
He arrived in Gwalior with his maternal grandsons Haddu Khan and Hassu Khan .
Another great khyal singer , also originally from Lucknow , was Ustad Bade Mohammed Khan who brought the Taan into khyal singing .
Haddu Khan and Hassu Khan further enhanced the style of the Gwalior gharana as we recognize it today .
Hassu Khan died prematurely .
Haddu Khan s son , Rehmat Ali Khan was a widely acclaimed singer who liberated the Gwalior style from the methodical form it followed to the emotional style that he preferred .
A distinguishing feature of the gharana is its simplicity , and one means to this is the selection of well-known ragas so that the listener is saved the effort of trying to identify the raga .
While the khyal singer does include Raga Vistar and Alankar to enhance the beauty and meaning of the raga , there is no attempt to include the Tirobhava feature in the interest of adding interest or mystery to the listeners experience .
The singing itself places Bandish at the heart of the presentation because of the gharanas belief that the full melody of the raga and guidance on its singing is provided by the bandish .
The asthayi section is sung twice before the antara , to be followed by swar-vistar in medium tempo .
This slow rendition of the notes is known as the Behlava , and is sung from Ma in the lower register to Pa in the higher register , following the pattern of the Aaroha and Avaroha of the raga .
The behlava is divided into the asthayi and antara .
The Dugun-Ka-Alap follows in which groups of two or four note combinations are sung in quicker succession but the basic tempo remains the same .
The Bol-Alap is next in which the different words of the text are sung in different ways , to be followed by Murkis in which notes are sung with ornamentation to a faster pace .
Bol-Taans entail the formation of melodic sequences with the words of the song .
The other Taans , including the Gamak , follow .
The Sapat Taan is important to the Gwalior style and refers to the singing of notes in a straight sequence and at a Vilambit pace .
Both Dhrupad and khyal singing evolved in Gwalior and there are many overlaps .
In the khyal style there is one form , Mundi Dhrupad , that incorporates all the features of dhrupad singing but without the Mukhda .
Common ragas include Alhaiya Bilawal , Yaman , Bhairav , Sarang , Shree , Hameer , Gaud Malhar , and Miya Ki Malhar
The tambura , tanpura , tamburi is a long-necked plucked lute found in different forms in Indian music culture .
Hindustani musicians speak of tanpura whereas Carnatic musicians say tambura ; tamburi is a smaller instrument used for accompanying instrumental soloists .
For practical use , all these types are called tanpura in the text .
The body shape of the tanpura somewhat resembles that of the sitar , but it has no frets - as the strings are always plucked at their full lengths .
One or more tanpuras may be used to accompany vocalists or instrumentalists .
It has four or five wire strings , which are plucked one after another in a regular pattern to create a harmonic resonance on the basic note or keynote .
Tanpuras form the root of the ensemble and indeed of the music itself , as the tanpura creates an acoustic dynamic reference chord from which the ragas derive their distinctive character , color and flavor .
Concerning its history , a quote from A. D. Ranade : The first unambiguous reference to the tanpura is in Sangit Parijat .
It is neither mentioned by the earlier texts nor does it find a place in sculptures .
An electronic tanpura , a small box that imitates the sound of a tanpura , is often used in contemporary Indian classical music performances instead of , or in addition to a tanpura .
Tanpuras come in different sizes and pitches : larger males , smaller females for vocalists , and a yet smaller version is used for accompanying sitar or sarod , called tamburi .
Male vocalists pitch their tonic note , often at C # ; female singers usually a fifth higher , though these tonic notes may vary according to the preference of the singer , as there is no absolute and fixed pitch-reference in the Indian classical music systems .
The male instrument has an open string length of approximately one metre ; the female is three-fourths of the male .
The standard tuning is 5-8-8-1 or , in Indian sargam , PA-sa-sa-SA .
For ragas that omit the fifth tone , pa , the first string is tuned down to the natural fourth : 4-8-8-1 or Ma-sa-sa-Sa .
Some ragas require a less common tuning with shuddh NI , NI-sa-sa-SA .
With a five-string instrument , the seventh or NI can be added : PA-NI-sa-sa-SA or MA-NI-sa-sa-SA .
The name tanapura is probably derived from tana , referring to a musical phrase , and pura , which means full or complete .
Both in its musical function and how it works , the tanpura is unique in many ways .
It does not partake in the melodic part of the music , but it supports and sustains the melody by providing a colourful and dynamic harmonic resonance field based on one precise tone , the basic note or key note .
Also , it is not played in rhythm with the music , as the precise timing of plucking a cycle of four strings in a continuous loop is a determinant factor in the resultant sound .
The special overtone-rich sound and the audible movement in the inner resonances of tone is achieved by applying the principle of jivari or jawari which creates a sustained buzzing sound in which particular harmonics will resonate with focused clarity .
Jiva refers to soul , that which gives life , implying that the tanpura embodies an animated tone quality .
Another linguistic reference is sawari which means saddle .
The principle of jivari can be compared to the prismatic refraction of white light into the colours of the rainbow , as its acoustic twin principle at work , amplifying the inner resonances of a tone to audible harmonics .
To achieve this effect , the strings pass over a wide , arched bridge , the front of which slopes gently away from the surface of the strings .
When a string is plucked , it has an intermittent periodical grazing contact with the bridge ; this intermittent grazing of the string on the curved bridge will move around in the sonation process , as the points of contact will gradually shift , being a compound function of amplitude , the curvature of the bridge , pitch and string tension .
When the string is plucked , it has a large amplitude , moving up and down and contacting the bridge on the down-phase .
As the energy of the strings movement gradually diminishes , the contact point of the string with the bridge slowly creeps up the slope of the bridge like a wave out of the sea spending itself on the beach .
Depending on scale and pitch , this can take between three and ten seconds .
This dynamic process can be fine-tuned using a cotton thread between string and bridge : by shifting the thread , the grazing contact sequence is shifted to a different position on the bridge , changing the harmonic content .
Every single string produces its own cascading range of harmonics and , at the same time , builds up a particular resonance .
According to this principle , tanpuras are attentively tuned to achieve a particular tonal shade relative to the tonal characteristics of the raga .
These more delicate aspects of tuning are directly related to what Indian musicians call raga svaroop , which is about how characteristic intonations are important defining aspects of a particular raga .
The tanpuras particular setup , with the cotton thread as a variable focus-point , made it possible to explore a multitude of harmonic relations produced by the subtle harmonic interplay in time of its four strings
Mallikarjun Bheemarayappa Mansur was an Indian classical singer of the khyal style in the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana of Hindustani classical music .
He received all three national Padma Awards , the Padma Shri in 1970 , Padma Bhushan in 1976 , and Padma Vibhushan , the second highest civilian honour given Government of India in 1992 .
In 1982 , he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship , the highest honour conferred by the Sangeet Natak Akademi , Indias National Academy of Music , Dance & Drama .
Mansur was born on December 31 , 1910 , at Mansur , a village five km .
west of Dharwad , Karnataka .
His father , Bheemaraayappa was village headman , a farmer by occupation was an ardent lover and patron of music .
He had four brothers and three sisters .
His elder brother Baswaraj owned a theatre troupe , thus at age nine Mansur did a small role acted in play .
Spotting the talent in his son , Mallikarjuns father engaged him to a travelling Yakshagana troupe .
The owner of this troupe took a liking to the tender and melodious voice of Mallikarjun and encouraged him to sing different types of compositions during the drama-performances .
Hearing one such performance , he was picked up by Pundit Appaya Swamy under whom he had his initial training in Carnatic music .
Sometime later , he was introduced to classical Hindustani music under Nilkanth Bua Alurmath of Miraj who belonged to the Gwalior Gharana .
The latter brought him to Ustad Alladiya Khan , the stalwart and the then patriarch of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana , in the late 1920s , who referred him to his elder son , Ustad Manji Khan .
Following Manji Khans untimely death , he came under the tutelage of Ustad Bhurji Khan , the younger son of Ustad Alladiya Khan .
This grooming under the Khan Brothers had the most important influence on his singing .
Mansur was well known for his command over a large number of rare ragas such as Shuddh Nat , Asa Jogiya , Hem Nat , Lachchhasakh , Khat , Shivmat Bhairav , Bihari , Sampoorna Malkauns , Lajawanti , Adambari Kedar and Bahaduri Todi , as well as his constant , mercurial improvisations in both melody and metre without ever losing the emotional content of the song .
Initially , his voice and style resembled that of Manji Khan and Narayanrao Vyas , but gradually he developed his own style of rendition .
He also remained music director with His Masters Voice and later music advisor to All India Radio s Dharwad station .
Mansur wrote an autobiographical book titled Nanna Rasayatre in Kannada , which has been translated into English as a book titled My Journey in Music by his son , Rajshekhar Mansur .
Mallikarjun Mansur was married to Gangamma .
He had seven daughters and a son Rajashekhar Mansur .
Amongst Pt Mansurs children , Rajashekhar Mansur and Neela Kodli are vocalists .
Rajashekhar Mansur was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi award in 2012 .
To mark his birth centenary , a three-day music festival was organized in Dharwad and Hubli from December 31 to January 2 , 2011 , wherein singer from across India performed , also performances were held at the Kariyamma Devi temple premises at his birth place Mansur village .
His ancestral home in Mansur was also converted into a memorial .
In 2013 , a five audio CD collection , Akashvani Sangeet of his music including rare Vachana Gayana renditions , was released by All India Radio archives at a ceremony held at Srijana Rangamandir at the Karnatak College Dharwar campus
