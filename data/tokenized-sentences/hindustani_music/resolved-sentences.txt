The sarod is a lutelike stringed instrument of India , used mainly in Indian classical music .
Along with the sitar , it is among the most popular and prominent instruments in Hindustani classical music .
 The sarod is known for a deep , weighty , introspective sound , in contrast with the sweet , overtone-rich texture of the sitar , with sympathetic strings that give The name Sarod a resonant , reverberant quality .
 The name Sarod is a fretless instrument able to produce the continuous slides between notes known as meend , which is important to Indian music .
The sarod is believed by some to have descended from the Afghan rubab , a similar instrument originating in Central Asia and Afghanistan .
 The name Sarod roughly translates to beautiful sound or melody in Persian , one of the many languages spoken in Afghanistan .
 Although the sarod has been referred to as a bass rubab The name Sarod tonal bandwidth is actually considerably greater than that of the rubab , especially in the middle and high registers .
 Lalmani Misra opines in Lalmani Misra Bharatiya Sangeet Vadya that the sarod is an combination of the ancient chitra veena , the medieval rubab and modern sursingar .
 There is also speculation that the oud may be the origin of the sarod.Jafar Khan brother of Pyar Khan and Basit Khan invented The name Sarod at the court of Wajid Ali Shah .
 Among the many conflicting and contested histories of the sarod , there is one that attributes The name Sarod invention to the ancestors of the present-day sarod maestro , Amjad Ali Khan .
 Amjad Ali Khan 's ancestor Mohammad Hashmi Khan Bangash , a musician and horse trader , came to India with the Afghan rubab in the mid-18th century , and became a court musician to the Maharajah of Rewa .
It was his descendants , notably his grandson Ghulam Ali Khan Bangash , a court musician in Gwalior , who changed the rubab into the sarod we know today .
A parallel theory credits descendants of Madar Khan , Niyamatullah Khan in particular , with the same innovation around 1820 .
 The sarod in its present form dates back to approximately 1820 , when it started gaining recognition as a serious instrument in Rewa , Shahjahanpur , Gwalior and the Lucknow Gharana .
In the 20th century , the sarod received some finishing touches from Allauddin Khan , the performer-pedagogue from Maihar best known as sitarist Ravi Shankar s guru .
However , as is the case with most young , evolving instruments , much work remains to be done in the area of sarod luthiery in order to achieve reliable customization , and precise replication of successful instruments .
This reflects the general state of Indian instrument making today .
The design of the instrument depends on the school of playing .
There are three distinguishable types , discussed below .
The conventional sarod is a 17 to 25-stringed lute-like instrument -- four to five main strings used for playing the melody , one or two drone strings , two chikari strings and nine to eleven sympathetic strings .
The design of this early model is generally credited to Niyamatullah Khan of the Lucknow Gharana as well as Ghulam Ali Khan of the Gwalior-Bangash Gharana .
Among the contemporary sarod players , this basic design is kept intact by two streams of sarod playing .
 Amjad Ali Khan and Amjad Ali Khan 's disciples play this model , as do the followers of Radhika Mohan Maitra .
Both Amjad Ali Khan and Buddhadev Dasgupta have introduced minor changes to their respective instruments which have become the design templates for their followers .
Both musicians use sarods made of teak wood , and a soundboard made of goat skin stretched across the face of the resonator .
Buddhadev Dasgupta prefers a polished stainless steel fingerboard for the ease of maintenance while Amjad Ali Khan uses the conventional chrome or nickel-plated cast steel fingerboard .
Visually , the two variants are similar , with six pegs in the main pegbox , two rounded chikari pegs and 11 to 15 sympathetic strings .
The descendants of Niyamatullah Khan also play similar instruments .
Some of the followers of Radhika Mohan Maitra still carry the second resonator on their sarods .
 Amjad Ali Khan and Amjad Ali Khan 's followers have rejected the resonator altogether .
These instruments are typically tuned to B , which is the traditional setting .
Another more technically sophisticated and acoustically superior type is that designed by Allauddin Khan and his brother Ayet Ali Khan .
This instrument , referred to by David Trasoff as the 1934 Maihar Prototype , is larger and longer than the conventional instrument , though the fingerboard is identical to the traditional sarod described above .
This instrument has 25 strings in all .
These include four main strings , four jod strings , two chikari strings and fifteen tarab strings .
The main strings are tuned to Ma , Sa , lower Pa and lower Sa , giving the instrument a range of three octaves .
 The Maihar sarod lends The Maihar sarod extremely well to the presentation of alap with the four jod strings providing a backdrop for the ambiance of the raga .
This variant is , however , not conducive to the performance of clean right-hand picking on individual strings .
The instrument is typically tuned to C .
The finest Sarods are made by Hemen Sen of Calcutta .
Most of the well known players such as Amjad Ali Khan , Tejendra Narayan Majumdar , Brij Narayan , Alam Khan and many others play Hemen Instruments .
Sarod strings are either made of steel or phosphor bronze .
Most contemporary sarod players use German or American-made strings , such as Roslau , Pyramid and Precision .
The strings are plucked with a triangular plectrum made of polished coconut shell , ebony , cocobolo wood , horn , cowbone , DelrinTM or other such materials .
Early sarod players used plain wire plectrums , which yield a soft , ringing tone .
The lack of frets and the tension of the strings make the sarod a very demanding instrument to play , as the strings must be pressed hard against the fingerboard .
There are two approaches to stopping the strings of the sarod .
One involves using the tip of ones fingernails to stop the strings , and the other uses a combination of the nail and the fingertip to stop the strings against the fingerboard .
 Fingering techniques and how they are taught depends largely on the personal preferences of Both musicians rather than on the basis of school affiliation .
 Radhika Mohan Maitra , for example , used the index , middle and ring finger of Radhika Mohan Maitra , for example left hand to stop the string , just like followers of Allauddin Khan do .
 Radhika Mohan Maitra , for example , however , made much more extensive use of the third fingernail for slides and hammers .
 Amjad Ali Khan , while a member of approximately the same stylistic school as Radhika Mohan , prefers to use just the index and middle fingers of Amjad Ali Khan 's left hand .
Amjad Ali is , however , pictured circa 1960 playing with all three fingers
was the fifth King of Oudh , holding the position from 13 February 1847 to 11 February 1856 .
 the fifth King of Oudh was the tenth and last Nawab of the state of prosperous Awadh in present day Uttar Pradesh in India .
 the fifth King of Oudh ascended the throne of prosperous Awadh in 1847 and ruled for nine years .
 the fifth King of Oudh kingdom , long protected by the British under treaty , was eventually annexed peacefully on 11 February 1856 - days before the ninth anniversary of the fifth King of Oudh coronation .
 The Nawab was exiled to Garden Reach in Metiabruz , then a suburb of Kolkata , where last Nawab of the state of Awadh lived out the rest of last Nawab of the state of Awadh life off a generous pension .
 last Nawab of the state of Awadh was a poet , playwright , dancer and great patron of the arts .
 last Nawab of the state of Awadh is widely credited with the revival of Kathak as a major form of classical Indian dance .
 Wajid Ali Shah succeeded to the throne of prosperous Awadh when the throne of Awadh glory days were at its peak and passing .
 The British had annexed much of the kingdom under the treaty of 1801 , and had impoverished prosperous Awadh by imposing a hugely expensive , the British army and repeated demands for loans .
The independence of Awadh in name was tolerated by the British only because they still needed a buffer state between their presence in the East and South , and the remnants of the Mughal Empire to the North .
 Wajid Ali Shah was most unfortunate to have ascended the throne of Oudh at a time when the British East India Company was determined to grab the coveted throne of prosperous prosperous Awadh , which was the garden , granary , and queen-province of India , though before Britain came into full control , Oudh predecessors and successors were one of the major threats to the Mughal Empire .
 In different circumstances perhaps , Nawab Wajid Ali Shah might have succeeded as a ruler because Nawab Wajid Ali Shah had many qualities that make a good administrator .
 Nawab Wajid Ali Shah was generous , kind and compassionate towards Nawab Wajid Ali Shah subjects , besides being one of the most magnanimous and passionate patrons of the Fine Arts .
 When Nawab Wajid Ali Shah ascended the throne , Nawab Wajid Ali Shah took keen interest in the administration of justice , introduced reforms , and reorganised the military department , but gradually sank into a life of pleasures surrounded by courtesans , singers , dancers , and eunuchs .
 Wajid Ali Shah was widely regarded as a debauched and detached ruler , but some of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah notoriety seems to have been misplaced .
The main case for condemnation comes from the British Resident of Lucknow , General Sleeman who submitted a report highlighting maladministration and lawlessness supposed to be prevailing there .
 This proved to be the trigger the British were looking for , and formed the official basis for This annexation .
 Recent studies have , however , suggested that Oudh was neither as bankrupt nor as lawless as the British had claimed .
 In fact , Oudh was for all practical purposes under British rule well before the annexation , with the Nawab playing little more than a titular role .
The army was composed mostly of British officers , while the purse strings were firmly under the control of the East India Company .
 In Oudh book prosperous Awadh Under Wajid Ali Shah , Dr. G.D. Bhatnagar gives the following assessment of this ill-starred prince : .
Cast by providence for the role of an accomplished dilettante , he found himself a misfit for the high office to which he was elevated by chance .
Wajid Ali Shahs character was complex .
 Though Wajid Ali Shahs was a man of pleasure , Wajid Ali Shahs was neither an unscrupulous knave nor a brainless libertine .
 Wajid Ali Shahs was a lovable and generous gentleman .
 Wajid Ali Shahs was a voluptuary , still Wajid Ali Shahs never touched wine , and though sunk in pleasure , Wajid Ali Shahs never missed Wajid Ali Shahs five daily prayers .
 It was the literary and artistic attainments of Wajid Ali Shah which distinguished Wajid Ali Shahs from Wajid Ali Shahs contemporaries .
 A large number of composers who thrived under the lavish patronage of the last Nawab of the state of Awadh rulers of Lucknow enriched the light classical form of thumri ; most prominent among these was Wajid Ali Shah .
 last Nawab of the state of Awadh was not only a munificent patron of music , dance , drama , and poetry , but was last Nawab of the state of Awadh a gifted composer .
 last Nawab of the state of Awadh had received vocal training under great Ustads like Basit Khan , Pyar Khan and Jafar Khan.Pyar Khan , Jafar Khan , and Basit Khan were the direct descendants of Miyan Tansen and were the sons of Famous Tanseni Chajju Khan.Bahadur Hussain Khan/Zia-ud-Daulah was the favourite musician of Wajid Ali Shah.Bahadur Hussain Khan was the son of Famous sufi saint Jeevan Shah of Jhansi , and descendant of Tansens son-in-law Naubaat Khan.Although Wajid Ali Shahs pen-name was Qaisar , last Nawab of the state of Awadh used the pseudonym Akhtarpiya for last Nawab of the state of Awadh numerous compositions .
 Under this pen name , last Nawab of the state of Awadh wrote over forty works - poems , prose and Thumris .
 Diwan-i-Akhtar , Husn-i-Akhtar contain Diwan-i-Akhtar , Husn-i-Akhtar Ghazals .
 Diwan-i-Akhtar , Husn-i-Akhtar is said to have composed many new ragas and named his Ghazals Jogi , Juhi , Shah-Pasand , etc. .
 Kathak dance attained new heights of popularity and glory under Diwan-i-Akhtar , Husn-i-Akhtar expert guidance and lavish patronage .
 Thakur Prasadji was Thakur Prasadji Kathak guru , and the unforgettable Kalka-Binda brothers performed in Kalka-Binda court .
 What with the grand pageantry of the Rahas , Jogiya Jashan , Dance dramas , and Kathak performances , Lucknow became the magnetic cultural centre where the most reputed musicians , dancers and poets of the time flourished .
 The greatest musicians , dancers and instrumentalists of the time enjoyed the Rahas Manzil munificent patronage and hospitality .
 When Wajid Ali Shah was a young boy , some astrologers warned Nawab Wajid Ali Shah parents that Nawab Wajid Ali Shah would become a Yogi , and advised them that the boy should be dressed up as a Yogi on each birthday of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah so as to counteract the effect of the evil stars .
 Nawab Wajid Ali Shah established Nawab Wajid Ali Shah famous Parikhaana in which hundreds of beautiful and talented girls were taught music and dancing by expert-teachers engaged by the royal patron .
These girls were known as Paris with names such as Sultan pari , Mahrukh pari and so on .
 On each birthday , the Nawab would dress up as a Yogi with saffron robes , ash of pearls smeared on last Nawab of the state of Awadh face and body , necklaces of pearls around last Nawab of the state of Awadh neck , and a rosary in last Nawab of the state of Awadh hand , and walk pompously into the court with two of his paris dressed up as Jogans .
 Gradually last Nawab of the state of Awadh made it into a spectacular pageant or Mela known as Jogia Jashan , in which all citizens of Lucknow could participate , dressed as Yogis , irrespective of caste and creed .
 Later on , when last Nawab of the state of Awadh favourite venue , the Qaisarbagh Baradari was built , last Nawab of the state of Awadh began to stage last Nawab of the state of Awadh magnificent Rahas full of sensuous poetry , last Nawab of the state of Awadh own lyrical compositions and glamorous Kathak dances .
Ranbir Singh gives details of Wajid Ali Shahs book entitled Bani in which the author mentions 36 types of Rahas all set in Kathak style , and gives exhaustive notes about the costumes , jewellery , and stage - craft .
 the Rahas Manzil , prepared at a fabulous cost of several lakhs of rupees , became very popular , and was performed at the Kaisarbagh-Rahas Manzil , .
 Many have regarded Wajid Ali Shah as the first playwright of the Hindustani theatre , because Many Radha Kanhaiyya Ka Qissa staged in the Rahas Manzil was the first play of its kind .
 It featured Radha Kanhaiyya Ka Qissa , Krishna , several sakhis , and a vidushaka-like character called Ramchera .
 Songs , glamorous Kathak dances , mime , and drama were all delightfully synthesised in these Rahas performances .
 Krishna dramatised many other poems such as Darya-i-Tashsq , Afsane-i-Isbaq , and Bhahar-i-Ulfat .
 Darya-i-Tashsq is said that Amanats Inder Sabha was inspired by these dance-dramas , written , produced and staged by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah .
 In Nawab Wajid Ali Shah exile in Metiabruz , Nawab Wajid Ali Shah tried to keep the sweet memories of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Lucknow era alive by recreating the musical environments of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Kaisarbagh Baradari .
 The banished king had been given a number of fine houses with vast grounds stretching along the banks of the River Hooghly 3 or 4 miles south of Kolkata .
 Because of an Earthen Dome , people called an Earthen Dome Matiya Burj .
 The king spent lavishly out of The banished king income of 12 lakh rupees per annum and before long a second Lucknow arose in this area .
 The banished king Bhairavi thumri Babul Mora Naihar Chhooto Jaay has been sung by several prominent singers , but the version most remembered is by Kundan Lal Saigal for the 1930s movie Street Singer .
In a strange manner this sad song epitomises the pain and agony of the poet king himself when he was exiled from his beloved Lucknow

The sarangi is a bowed , short-necked string instrument from South Asia which is used in Hindustani classical music .
It is said to most resemble the sound of the human voice - able to imitate vocal ornaments such as gamaks and meends .
There are different versions for the meaning and origins of sarangi The word sarangi could be a combination of two sanskrit words : saar and ang hence meaning the instrument that can summarize every style of music or playing .
 According to some musicians , the word Sarangi is a combination of two words ` seh ' and ` rangi ' corrupted as the word Sarangi .
The term seh-rangi represents the three melody strings .
 the word Sarangi is widely believed to mean `` a hundred colours '' indicating its adaptability to a wide range of musical styles , its flexible tunability , and its ability to produce a large palette of tonal colour and emotional nuance .
 the word Sarangi now enjoys the status of a solo classical instrument due to the single-handed efforts of Ram Narayan .
There is a variation to the fingering technique that was used by Ram Narayan .
It differs from the standard fingering as to when one shifts from the first finger to the second finger .
Well known sarangi players include Mamman Khan , Nathu Khan , Shakoor Khan , Sagiruddin Khan , Hanuman Prasad Mishra , Abdul Lateef Khan , Bundu Khan , Majid Khan , Basheer Khan , Mahmood Khan , Sabri Khan and Sultan Khan .
The repertoire of sarangi players is traditionally very closely related to vocal music .
Nevertheless , a concert with a solo sarangi as the main item will probably include a full-scale raag presentation with an extensive alap in increasing intensity and several compositions in increasing tempi called bandish .
As such , it is on a par with other instrumental styles such as for sitar , sarod , and bansuri .
 the word Sarangi music is often vocal music .
It is rare to find a sarangi player who does not know the words of many classical compositions .
The words are usually mentally present during performance , and performance almost always adheres to the conventions of vocal performance including the organisational structure , the types of elaboration , the tempo , the relationship between sound and silence , and the presentation of khyal and thumri compositions .
The vocal quality of sarangi is in a quite separate category from , for instance , the so-called gayaki-ang of sitar which attempts to imitate the nuances of khyal while overall conforming to the structures and usually keeping to the gat compositions of instrumental music .
The sarangi is also a traditional stringed musical instrument of Nepal , commonly played by the Gaine or Gandarbha ethnic group but the form and repertoire of sarangi is more towards the folk music as compared to the heavy and classical form of repertoire in India .
Carved from a single block of tun wood , the sarangi has a box-like shape with three hollow chambers : pet , chaati and magaj .
It is usually around long and around wide though it can vary as there are smaller as well as larger variant sarangis as well .
The lower resonance chamber or pet is covered with parchment made out of goat skin on which a strip of thick leather is placed around the waist which supports the elephant-shaped bridge that is made of camel or buffalo bone usually .
 The bridge in turn supports the huge pressure of approximately 35-37 sympathetic steel or brass strings and three main gut strings that pass through The bridge in turn .
The three main playing strings - the comparatively thicker gut strings - are bowed with a heavy horsehair bow and stopped not with the finger-tips but with the nails , cuticles and surrounding flesh .

The neck has ivory/bone platforms on which the fingers slide .
The remaining strings are resonance strings or tarabs , numbering up to around 35-37 , divided into 4 choirs having two sets of pegs , one on the right and one on the top .
On the inside is a chromatically tuned row of 15 tarabs and on the right a diatonic row of 9 tarabs each encompassing a full octave plus 1-3 extra notes above or below that .
Both these sets of tarabs pass from the main bridge to the right side set of pegs through small holes in the chaati supported by hollow ivory/bone beads .
 Between these inner tarabs and on the either side of the main playing The remaining strings lie two more sets of longer tarabs , with 5-6 strings on the right set and 6-7 strings on the left set .
They pass from the main bridge over to two small , flat and wide table like bridges through the additional bridge towards the second peg set on top of the instrument .
These are tuned to the important tones of the raga .
A properly tuned sarangi will hum and cry and will sound like melodious meowing , with tones played on any of the main strings eliciting echo-like resonances .
A few sarangis use strings manufactured from the intestines of goats -- these harken back to the days when rich musicians could afford such strings .
Three historic sarangi from The Metropolitan Museum of Art

 Joness and Keith Richards guitars became a signature of the sound of the Rolling Stones , with both guitarists playing rhythm and lead without clear boundaries between the two roles .
From 1966 onwards Joness contributions in the recording studio were more as a multi-instrumentalist than as a guitarist .
His aptitude for playing a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums Aftermath , Between the Buttons and Their Satanic Majesties Request .
 Andrew Loog Oldham s arrival marked the beginning of Joness slow estrangement , Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. prominent role gradually diminishing as the Stones centre shifted from Jones to singer Mick Jagger and Keith Richards .
 Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers writing their own songs , as exemplified by Lennon-McCartney , and that playing covers would not sustain a band in the limelight for long .
 Further , Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. wanted to make singer Mick Jagger charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances .
 Jones saw his influence over the Stones direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers that he preferred ; more Jagger/Richards originals developed , and Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. increased Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. own managerial control , displacing Jones from yet another role .
 According to Oldham in his book Stoned , Jones , Jones was an outsider from the beginning .
 When the first tours were arranged in 1963 , Oldham in his book travelled separately from the band , stayed at different hotels , and demanded extra pay .
 According to Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. , Jones was very emotional and felt alienated because Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. was not a prolific song writer and Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. management role had been taken away .
 Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle , and so life was becoming more desperate for Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. day by day .
None of us were looking forward to Brian totally cracking up .
The toll from days on the road , the money and fame , and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in Joness overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs .
 Joness overindulgence frequently used LSD , pills , and cannabis , and Joness overindulgence drank heavily .
 These excesses had a debilitative effect on Joness overindulgence physical health and , according to Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. , Jones became unfriendly and asocial at Good Times .
 Joness overindulgence health problems caused Joness overindulgence to be hospitalised on a number of occasions .
Jones was arrested for drug possession on 10 May 1967 , shortly after the Redlands incident at Richards Sussex home .
 Authorities found marijuana , cocaine , and methamphetamine in Authorities flat .
 Authorities confessed to marijuana use but claimed Authorities did not use hard drugs .
Reacting as fans did at the arrests of Joness band mates , protesters appeared outside court demanding that Jones be freed .
He was not kept in jail but was fined , given probation , and ordered to see a counselor .
In June 1967 , Jones attended the Monterey Pop Festival with singer Nico , with whom he had a brief relationship .
There he met Frank Zappa and Dennis Hopper , and went on stage to introduce the Jimi Hendrix Experience which was not well known yet in the USA .
One review referred to Jones as the unofficial king of the festival .
 Hostility grew between Jones , singer Mick Jagger , and Keith Richards , alienating Jones further from the group .
 Although many noted that Jones could be friendly and outgoing , Wyman , Keith Richards , and jazz-influenced Charlie Watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult .
By most accounts , Joness attitude changed frequently ; he was one minute caring and generous , the next making an effort to anger everyone .
 As Wyman observed in Stone Alone : There were two Brians ... one was introverted , shy , sensitive , deep-thinking ... the other was a preening peacock , gregarious , artistic , desperately needing assurance from his peers ... he pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond .
 In March 1967 , Anita Pallenberg , Joness girlfriend of two years , left him for Keith Richards when Jones was hospitalised during a trip the three made to Morocco , further damaging the already strained relations between Jones and Keith Richards .
As tensions and Joness substance use increased , his musical contributions became sporadic .
He became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play , and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions .
In Peter Whiteheads promotional film for We Love You , made in July 1967 , he appears groggy .
Joness last substantial sessions with the Stones occurred in spring and summer of 1968 when the Stones produced Jumpin Jack Flash and the Beggars Banquet album .
 He can be seen in the Jean-Luc Godard film One Plus One playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with Keith Richards , although Jones is neglected in the music-making .
The film chronicles the making of Sympathy for the Devil .
Joness acoustic guitar can be heard occasionally in the film through the microphones of the film crew but was not included in the released version .
It was clear Jones was not long for the group .
Where once he played multiple instruments on many tracks , now he played only minor roles on a few pieces .
Joness last formal appearance was in the December 1968 The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus , a part concert , part circus-act film organised by the band .
 It went unreleased for 25 years because singer Mick Jagger was unhappy with the bands performance compared to others in the film such as Jethro Tull , The Who , and Taj Mahal .
 In the DVD release of the film Joness playing is inaudible except during Jumpin Jack Flash , Sympathy For The The Devil , and No Expectations .
Commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that the end of Joness time with the Rolling Stones was near , and Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend of The Who thought it would be Joness last live musical performance .
Jones was arrested a second time on 21 May 1968 , for possession of cannabis , which Jones said had been left by previous tenants of the flat .
He was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty owing to his probation .
Wyman commented , The fact that the police had secured a warrant with no evidence showed the arrest was part of a carefully orchestrated plan .
 Julian Brian and the Stones were being targeted in an effort to deter the public from taking drugs .
 The jury found Julian Brian guilty but the judge had sympathy for Jones ; instead of jailing Julian Brian Julian Brian fined Julian Brian PS50 plus PS105 in costs and told Julian Brian : For goodness sake , dont get into trouble again or The jury really will be serious .
 Joness legal troubles , estrangement from Julian Brian bandmates , substance abuse and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to active participation in the band .
 The Rolling Stones wanted to tour the United States in 1969 for the first time in three years but Jones was not in fit condition to tour and his second arrest exacerbated His health problems with acquiring a the United States in 1969 work visa .
 In addition , Joness attendance of rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic ; and when he did appear he rarely contributed anything musically or his bandmates would switch off his guitar leaving Keith Richards playing nearly all the guitars .
 According to Gary Herman , Jones was literally incapable of making music ; when Gary Herman tried to play harmonica Gary Herman mouth started bleeding .
This behaviour was problematic during the Beggars Banquet sessions and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording Let It Bleed .
In March 1969 , Jones borrowed the groups Jaguar and went shopping in Pimlico Road .
After the parked car was towed by police Jones hired a chauffeur car to get home .
In May 1969 , Jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to a hospital under an assumed name .
From this point , Jones was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the bands music .
 By May 1969 , he had made two contributions to the work in progress : autoharp on You Got the Silver and percussion on Midnight Rambler .
 Brian Joness last photo session as a Rolling Stone took place on Wednesday , 21 May 1969 , first at St. Katherine Dock s , Tower Bridge , London and then at Ethan Russells photographic studio in South Kensington , London .
The photos would appear on the album Through The Past Darkly in September 1969 .
 The Stones decided that following the release of the Let it Bleed album St. Katherine Dock s would start a North American tour in November 1969 .
However , the Stones management was informed that because of his drug convictions Jones would not receive a work permit .
At the suggestion of pianist and road manager Ian Stewart the Stones decided to add a new guitarist and on 8 June 1969 , Jones was visited by Mick Jagger , Keith Richards , and Charlie Watts where he was told that the group he had formed would continue without him .
To the public it appeared as if Jones had left voluntarily ; the other band members told him that although he was being asked to leave it was his choice how to break it to the public .
Jones released a statement on 9 June 1969 , announcing his departure .
 In this statement he said , among other things , that the United States in 1969 no longer see eye-to-eye with the others over the discs we are cutting .
Jones was replaced by 20-year-old guitarist Mick Taylor .
During the period of his decreasing involvement in the band Jones was living at Cotchford Farm in East Sussex , the residence formerly owned by Winnie-the-Pooh author A. A. Milne which Jones had purchased in November 1968 .
There is uncertainty as to the mental and physical state Jones was in .
The last known photographs of Jones taken by schoolgirl Helen Spittal on 23 June 1969 , shortly after his departure from the Stones are not flattering ; he appears bloated with deep-set eyes .
However , Alexis Korner , who visited in late June only shortly after the Spittal photos were taken , noted that Jones seemed happier than he had ever been .
He is known to have contacted Korner , Ian Stewart , John Lennon , Mitch Mitchell , and Jimmy Miller about intentions to put together another band .
 Jones had apparently demoed a few of his own songs in the weeks before his death , including Has Anybody Seen the United States in 1969 Baby ?
and Chow Time .
At around midnight on the night of 2-3 July 1969 , Jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at Cotchford Farm .
His Swedish girlfriend , Anna Wohlin , was convinced Jones was alive when he was taken out of the pool insisting he still had a pulse .
However , by the time the doctors arrived it was too late and he was pronounced dead .
The coroners report stated death by misadventure and noted his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by drug and alcohol abuse .
Many items such as instruments and expensive furniture were reportedly stolen from the home after Joness death .
Rumours also exist that recordings by Jones for his future projects were stolen but nothing has surfaced to date .
A watch given by Alexis Korner to Jones with a personal inscription surfaced in an auction at Christies in New York .
 Upon Joness death the whistling on Walking the Dog Who s Pete Townshend wrote a poem titled A Normal Day for Julian Brian , A Man Who Died Every Day , Jimi Hendrix dedicated a song to Jimi Hendrix on the United States in 1969 television , and Jim Morrison of The Doors published a poem entitled Ode to L.A. .
While Thinking of Brian Jones , Deceased .
 Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison of The Doors both died within the following two years , both aged 27 , the same as Jones .
The Rolling Stones performed at a free concert in Hyde Park on 5 July 1969 , two days after Joness death .
The concert had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present the Stones new guitarist , Mick Taylor , and the band decided to dedicate the concert to Jones .
 Before the Rolling Stones set singer Mick Jagger read excerpts from Adonais , a poem by Percy Shelley about the death of singer Mick Jagger friend John Keats , and stagehands released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute .
 The band opened with a Johnny Winter song that was one of Joness favourites , Im Yours and Im Hers .
Jones was reportedly buried deep in Cheltenham Cemetery in a lavish casket sent by Bob Dylan .
 jazz-influenced Charlie Watts and Wyman were the only Rolling Stones who attended the funeral .
 Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull were travelling to Australia to begin the filming of Ned Kelly ; Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull stated that Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull contracts did not allow Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull to delay the trip to attend the funeral .
Keith Richards reportedly remained in the recording studio .
 When asked if Keith Richards felt guilty about Joness death Mick Jagger told Rolling Stone in 1995 : No , the United States in 1969 dont really .
 the United States in 1969 do feel that the United States in 1969 behaved in a very childish way , but we were very young , and in some ways we picked on Keith Richards .
 But , unfortunately , Keith Richards made Keith Richards a target for it ; Keith Richards was very , very jealous , very difficult , very manipulative , and if you do that in this kind of a group of people you get back as good as you give , to be honest .
 the United States in 1969 wasnt understanding enough about Keith Richards drug addiction .
No one seemed to know much about drug addiction .
Things like LSD were all new .
No one knew the harm .
People thought cocaine was good for you .
Theories surrounding Joness death developed soon afterwards with associates of the Stones claiming to have information that he was murdered .
According to rock biographer Philip Norman , the murder theory would bubble back to the surface every five years or so .
In 1993 it was reported that Jones was murdered by Frank Thorogood , who was doing some construction work on the property .
He was the last person to see Jones alive .
Thorogood allegedly confessed to the murder to the Rolling Stones driver , Tom Keylock , who later denied this .
The Thorogood theory was dramatised in the 2005 movie Stoned .
In August 2009 , Sussex Police decided to review Joness death for the first time since 1969 , after new evidence was handed to them by Scott Jones , an investigative journalist in the UK .
Scott Jones had traced many of the people who were at Brian Joness house the night he died plus unseen police files held at the National Archives .
In the Mail on Sunday in November 2008 , Scott Jones said Frank Thorogood killed Brian Jones in a fight and the senior police officers covered up the true cause of death .
 Following the review the Richards Sussex police stated that they would not be reopening the case .
They asserted that this has been thoroughly reviewed by Sussex Polices Crime Policy and Review Branch but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroners original verdict of death by misadventure was incorrect .
As such , the case will not be reopened .
Unsure and insecure as a composer , Jones was not a prolific songwriter .
The 30-second Rice Krispies jingle for Kelloggs , co-written with the J. W. Thompson advertising agency in 1963 and performed by the Rolling Stones incognito was credited to Jones ; this did not sit well with the rest of the band , who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally .
Jones was also included in the Nanker/Phelge songwriting credit , a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and Andrew Oldham .
 According to Andrew Oldham , the main reason for Joness not writing the Chuck Berry songs was that Jones , being a blues purist , did not love simple pop music enough .
 Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. tried to establish a songwriting partnership between Jones and Gene Pitney after becoming bored senseless by Joness bleating about the potential of half-finished melodies that by no means deserved completion , but after two days of sessions the results remain best to be unheard , even by Stones completists .
 When asked in 1965 if Andrew Loog Oldham , LTD. had written the Chuck Berry songs , Jones replied : Always tried .
Ive written quite a few , but mostly in blues style .
Many years later after his death , Keith Richards stated : No , no , absolutely not .
 Many years was the one thing he would never do .
Brian wouldnt show them to anybody within the Stones .
 Brian as far as the United States in 1969 know never wrote a single finished song in Brian as far as I know never life ; Brian as far as I know never wrote bits and pieces but Brian as far as I know never never presented them to us .
 No doubt Brian as far as I know never spent hours , weeks , working on Things like LSD , but Brian as far as I know never paranoia was so great that Brian as far as I know never could never bring Brian as far as I know never to present them to us .
 Bill Wyman has stated that Jones was an incredibly gifted musician , but not a song writer ; and in 1995 , Mick Jagger told Rolling Stone that Jones had been jealous of the Jagger/Richards songwriting team , and added : To be honest , Julian Brian had no talent for writing the Chuck Berry songs .
None .
Ive never known a guy with less talent for songwriting .
Marianne Faithfull reported that Brian Jones wrote an early version of the melody for Ruby Tuesday and presented it to the group .
Victor Bockris reported that Keith Richards and Brian Jones worked out the final melody in the studio .
 Additionally , Jones is credited for the instrumental piece Hear It , though the instrumental piece Hear It is generally considered Joness work .
However , in 1966 Jones composed , produced , and played on the soundtrack to Mord und Totschlag , an avant-garde German film with Anita Pallenberg , adding the majority of the instrumentation to the soundtrack .
Although guitarist Jimmy Page is one of the three extra musicians Jones hired to play on the soundtrack .
In 1990 , Carla Olson was given permission from Joness estate to put one of his poems to music and thus created the Jones/Olson song Thank You For Being There .
It appeared on the album True Voices , performed by Krysia Kristianne and Robin Williamson .
 In summer 1968 , Jones recorded the Morocco-based ensemble , the Master Musicians of Joujouka , as the name of the Moroccan mountain village was spelled at the time , the more correct spelling of the Arabic name being Jajouka , which was later used by the band ; the recording was released in 1971 as Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka .
 singer Mick Jagger and Keith Richards visited Jajouka in 1989 after recording Continental Drift for the Rolling Stones album Steel Wheels with The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar in Tangier .
 A homage to Jones entitled Brian Jones Joujouka very Stoned , painted by Mohamed Hamri , who had brought Jones to Jajouka in 1967 , appeared on the cover of Joujouka Black Eyes by the Master Musicians of Joujouka in 1995 , this being a splinter group created by an Irish friend of the former and estranged Moroccan manager , Mohamed Hamri .
 Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Jajouka was rereleased in cooperation with Bachir Attar and Philip Glass in 1995 .
The executive producers were Philip Glass , Kurt Munkasci and Rory Johnston , with notes by Bachir Attar , Paul Bowles , William S. Burroughs , Stephen Davis , Brian Jones , Brion Gysin and David Silver .
and included additional graphics , more extensive notes by David Silver and William S. Burroughs , and a second CD , produced by Cliff Mark , with two full-length remixes .
In mid-May 1967 , Jones played oboe on The Beatles Baby , Youre a Rich Man .
Jones played alto saxophone on The Beatles song You Know My Name , which was released in March 1970 , eight months after his death .
Jones was tall with blue-grey eyes and blond hair .
 Anita Pallenberg has stated in an interview that he wanted to look like Francoise Hardy , he loved dressing up and posing about and that he would ask Francoise Hardy to do his hair and make-up .
Bo Diddley described Brian as a little dude that was trying to pull the group ahead .
 the United States in 1969 saw Bo Diddley-style as the leader .
 Bo Diddley-style didnt take no mess .
 Bo Diddley-style was a fantastic cat ; Bo Diddley-style handled the group beautifully .
Joness death at 27 was the first of the 1960s rock movement ; Jimi Hendrix , Janis Joplin , and Jim Morrison found their own drug-related deaths at the same age within two years .
 The coincidence of ages has been described as the 27 the Ealing Jazz Club .
 When Alastair Johns , who owned Cotchford Farm for over 40 years after Joness death , refurbished the pool , Alastair Johns sold the original tiles to Joness fans for PS100 each , which paid for half of the work .
 Alastair Johns noted that Cotchford Farm remained for decades an attraction for Joness fans .
 singer Mick Jagger wrote The Stones Shine a Light after Joness death , depicts Joness behaviour and remoteness from the band , and asks God to shine a light on God soul .
 Several other songs have been written about Jones : Morrisons death Ray Manzarek originally wrote The Doors song Tightrope Ride for Jones , but after Morrisons death Ray Manzarek rewrote some of the lyrics so that they apply to both musicians .
The Psychic TV song Godstar is about Joness death , as are Robyn Hitchcock s Trash , The Drovers Shes as Pretty as Brian Jones Was , Ted Nugent s Death by Misadventure , and Salmonblaster s Brian Jones .
Toy Love s song Swimming Pool lists several dead rock icons including Jones ; Jones is also mentioned in De Phazz s song Something Special .
 The Master Musicians of Joujouka song Brian Jones Joujouka Very Stoned , Jones was released in 1974 and 1996 .
 The Brian Jonestown Massacre band named The Brian Jonestown Massacre band partially after Brian Jonestown Massacre .

Khyal is the modern genre of classical singing in North India .
 Khyal name comes from an Arabic word meaning imagination .
It is not thought to have developed out of the qawwa .
singing style .
It appeared more recently than dhrupad , is a more free and flexible form , and it provides greater scope for improvisation .
Like all Indian classical music , khyal is modal , with a single melodic line and no harmonic parts .
The modes are called raga , and each raga is a complicated framework of melodic rules .
Khyal bases itself on a repertoire of short songs ; a khyal song is called a bandish .
Every singer generally renders the same bandish differently , with only the text and the raga remaining the same .
Khyal bandishes are typically composed in a variant of Urdu/Hindi , and sometimes in Persian , Marathi or Punjabi , and these compositions cover diverse topics , such as romantic or divine love , praise of kings or gods , the seasons , dawn and dusk , and the pranks of Krishna , and they can have symbolism and imagery .
The bandish is divided into two parts -- the sthayi and the antara , with the former considered more important as it shows the melodic contours of the raga .
The sthayi often uses notes from the lower octave and the lower half of the middle octave , while the antara ascends to the tonic of the upper octave and beyond before descending and linking back to the sthayi .
The singer uses the composition as raw material for improvisation , accompanied by a harmonium or bowed string instrument such as the sarangi or violin playing off the singers melody line , a set of two hand drums , and a drone in the background .
The role of the accompanist playing the melody-producing instrument is to provide continuity when the singer pauses for breath , using small variations of the singers phrases or parts thereof .
While there is a wide variety of rhythmic patterns that could be used by the percussionist , khyal performances typically use Ektaal , Jhoomra , Jhaptaal , Tilwada , Tintal , Rupak , and Adachautaal .
A typical khyal performance uses two songs -- the bada khyal or great khyal , in slow tempo , comprises most of the performance , while the chhota khyal , in fast tempo , is used as a finale and is usually in the same raga but a different taal .
The songs are sometimes preceded by improvised alap to sketch the basic raga structure without drum accompaniment ; alap is given much less room in khyal than in dhrupad .
As the songs are short , and performances long , the lyrics lose some of their importance .
Improvisation is added to the songs in a number of ways : for example improvising new melodies to the words , using the syllables of the songs to improvise material , singing the names of the scale degrees -- sa , re , ga , ma , pa , dha and ni -- or simply interspersing phrases sung on vowels , usually the vowel A , akaar taans .
Taans are one of the major distinguishing features of the khyal .
Now and then , the singer returns to the song , especially its first line , as a point of reference .
Besides the vilambit and drut tempos , a performance may include ati-vilambit , madhya and ati-drut tempos .
Song forms such as taranas , thumris or tappas are sometimes used to round off a khyal performance .
 Khayal was popularized by Niyamat Khan and Khayal nephew Firoz Khan , both musicians in the court of Muhammad Shah Rangile .
It seems likely that khyal already existed at the time , although perhaps not in the present form .
The compositions of Sadarang and Adarang employ the theme of Hindi love-poetry .
 The khyal of this period also acquired the dignity of Dhrupad and the manner of the veena in the dignity of Dhrupad glide or meend , plus a number of musical alankars that were introduced into the body of the composition .
The gharana system arose out of stylistic rendering of the khyal by various subsequent generations of musicians .
The gharanas have distinct styles of presenting the khyal -- how much to emphasize and how to enunciate the words of the composition , when to sing the sthayi and antara , whether to sing an unmetered alap in the beginning , whether to do bol-alap or aakar-alap , what kinds of improvisations to use , how much importance to give to the rhythmic aspect , and so on .
With India united into a country from various scattered princely states , with royal courts and the zamindari system abolished , and with modern communications and recording technology , stylistic borders have become blurred and many singers today have studied with teachers from more than one gharana .
 This used to be uncommon , and a few decades ago teachers used to forbid students to even hear other gharana singers perform , not allowing This to buy records or listen to the radio .
Today , as always , a singer is expected to develop an individual style , albeit one that is demonstrably linked to tradition

 Samagan is purpose of creation of Samaveda .
 Sam Veda is singing of hymns from Rigveda alone and not from other Veda-s .
richi adhyoodham sam Rci adhyuuddhrm saam .
 Hence Sam Veda is composition of words in Rigvedic hymns into notes .
 The richa-s or hymns of Rigveda are called yoni or adhar as The richa-s or hymns of Rigveda form the base of Samgan .
 In musicological parlance Sam Veda has taken matu from Rigveda and provided dhatu to these words .
 Archik.aarcik Only a few hymns in Sam Veda Samhita were not based upon richa-s taken from Rigveda .
 The bulk being based on Rigveda is known as Archik .
 The bulk being based on Rigveda has two parts .
Poorvarchik .
puurvaarcik 585 Richa-s are sub-grouped into 6 Prapathak-s .
Each Prapathak has two Ardh-s .
Each Ardh has 10 Dashati-s .
A collection of ten is called a Dashati .
Uttararchik .
 uttraarcik Uttararchik has 1225 richa-s contained in 9 Prapathak-s , first five having two ardh-s each and the remaining four having three ardh-s each .
Aranyak Samhita .
arnnyk smhitaa It is merely a collection of verses that could be sung .
 Patanjalis statement , sahasravartma samvedah shsrvrtm smvedH gives rises to speculation that there were a thousand branches of Sam Veda , while Sam Veda poetically indicated there could be a thousand ways in which Sam Veda could be sung .
In Samtarpan there are a maximum of 13 Acharya-s but today there are only three branches .
Archik grantha contains hymns that are yoni or base to Gan or singing .
The collections of suitably modified richa-s are known as Gan-grantha .
 the true Sam are the true Sam .
 Sam Veda created on richa-s of Poorvarchik are called Gram-gan , graamgaan Gramegeya-gan , graamgeyogaan Prakriti-gan prkRtigaan or Veya-gan veygaan .
 Sam Veda created on richa-s of Aranyak Samhita are termed Aranya-gan arnnyaagaan or Aranyageya-gan arnnygeyogaan .
 Sam Veda created on richa-s of Uttararchik are known as Ooh-gan .
uuhgaan .
The Sanskrit root ooh means to modify according to need .
Aranyageya-gan : Practiced in solitude of forest .
Also called Rahasyageyo-gan .
Ooh-gan : Pragath-s specially created for yajna on basis of Gramgeyo-gan .
Oohya-gan uuhygaan : Pragath-s created for yajna on basis of Rahasyageyo-gan .
There is a difference in number of songs attributed to different branches .
Shri Satvalekar in preface to Samveda Samhita has given the following table of songs .
Fox Strangways in Music of Hindustan says , Vocal scales are conceived downwards .
 They are so conceived , because the telling notes of the voice in Music of Hindustan upper register , and this presents itself , therefore as the starting point for a vocal scale .
 The Sayan # - bhashya on Sam-vidhan Brahmin establishes that note of Sam Veda were of nidhan prakriti and followed a descending order .
 In Naradiya Shiksha the seven notes of Sam Veda are First , Second , Third , Fourth , Mandra , Krushta and Atiswar .
 This indicates that initially only three or four notes were used for Samgan .
Archik songs were sung on the basis of just one note , e.g. Sa Sa Sa , or Ni Ni Ni .
This kind of chanting was well suited to Havan , Mantra-path and Jap .
Gathik songs were hymns in praise of deities and used two notes , e.g. Ni Ni Ni Ni , Sa Sa Sa Sa .
 Sam Veda songs for the first time used three notes .
 The word Sam Veda is taken to mean three notes .
The songs were like Ga Ga Re Re Sa Sa Sa .
Apart from these three basic notes , the singers came across a fourth which they called Swarantar .
 When they discovered a note lower than the lowest known note they called it Mandra .
 When a still lower note than Mandra was found they called a still lower note than Mandra Atiswar .
 A higher note determined was called Krushta after Sanskrit root Krush .
So the complete Samic Saptak in descending order contains : .
To preserve the Samik notes , Raga Sameshwari was created .
Dr. Lalmani Misra first translated the notes M G R S D N P into Shadja gram -- S N D P G M R -- and then created a Raga which is performed in the evening .
Shruti-jati is defined as the way in which a particular note could be applied to make the song appealing .
There are five with individual signs for three shruti-jati-s .
The hymn part of the Vedas are called Samhitas .
 the Brahmanas are the earliest known text after the Vedas were written , as explanation and appendices of the Vedas , and guides to the custom and practice of vedic singing and ritual .
The Upanisads and the Aranyakas became in turn appendices to the Brahmanas .
Upanishad or Vedanta deal with systematic treatment of metaphysical questions and form the philosophical basis of Hinduism .
 Upanishad or Vedanta are dated from 1000 BC to 300 BC , the end of the Vedic period to the beginning of Puranic period .
The Pre-Buddha time is considered Early Brahmana period and Post-Buddha period is considered the Later Brahmana period .
The oral texts were composed by a great number of rishis .
Though upanishads number more than a hundred , there are about 8 to 12 principal ones .
All upanishads are based on one of the four Vedas .
Upanisads deal with various subjects such as the nature of Brahman , the ideal human conduct , the practice of yoga , the nature of Atman , creation of the world , creation of humanity , the nature of reality , the nature of true knowledge and ignorance , the nature of consciousness , the concept of karma , and incarnation of soul .
A Rishi in Rig Veda is an author of a Rik , a hymn mantra , derived from oral tradition and direct insight , not from reasoning or intellect .
Envisioned are beings beyond the range of human senses , conceived from self-evident knowledge and realized Truth by direct intuition .
 Rishi Vamadeva , in hymn describes A Rishi in Rig Veda as the illumined one , expressing A Rishi in Rig Veda Truth revealed .
The term Rishi is defined as rishati jnanena samsara-param '' meaning one who goes beyond the mundane world by means of knowledge .
Further , some scholars think the root drish might have given rise to root rish meaning to see .
 The term Rishi is therefore a divine seer , a drastara , one who visualizes a mantra .
Also the one who hears the voices and song .
The seers were the hearers of the Truth .
Sri Aurobindo described Shruthi as divine recordings of cosmic sounds of truth heard by the Rishis .
The Vedas are thus Shruthis , revealed scriptures .
 Shruthis is the reason , the Vedas are Apaurusheya , not authored by any agency .
The Rig Veda contains 10,552 hymns ; grouped into 1,028 Sukthas each of roughly ten mantras , spread over ten Mandalas .
The Mandalas are of differing sizes .
These mantra songs are authored by some 400 Rishis of whom about 30 were women .
Of the ten Mandalas six Mandalas , numbering from 2 to 7 are homogenous in character and are considered the oldest parts of the Rig Veda .
 Each of these six books was composed by a The term Rishi and by members of the Rishi family/disciples and of the Gotra , and are therefore often called Family Books .
Books 1 , 8 and 10 composed by different individual Rishis .
 The Books 1 and 8 are almost Family Books as a majority of Each of these six books hymns are composed by the family of Kanvas and many hymns are found in both the Books .
The Book 9 is different from the rest ; all the hymns therein are addressed to Soma , from groups of Rishis .
The tenth Book is an addition of various early and late hymns .
Books 1 and 10 are the latest and longest , accounting for about 40 percent of the bulk of the Rig Veda .
Certain texts called Anukramani serve as Index to the Rig Veda and provide information about each hymn of the Rig Veda .
The most well-known of the Aukramani is Katyayana 's sarvanukramani and is dated around the 2nd century .
 The entries in the texts mention each hymn , specifying the name of the Rishi who authored the hymn , or transposed Katyayana 's sarvanukramani into writing ; the Devatha who inspired or to whom the hymn is addressed ; and the Chandas or the metre of the hymn .
 the true Sam are extremely useful in historical analysis of the Rig Veda

Dhamar is one of the talas used in Hindustani classical music .
 Dhamar is associated with the dhrupad style and typically played on the pakhawaj .
 Dhamar tala has 14 beats grouped asymmetrically into a 5-2-3-4 pattern .
A song in dhrupad style set to dhamar tala is also called a dhamar .
The text of a dhamar concerns the antics of Krishna teasing the milkmaids during the Holi Spring Festival of colours .
It is considered a relatively light and romantic musical form .

An electronic tanpura is an electronic instrument that replicates the sound of an Indian string instrument known as the tanpura .
In Indian music , drone is a basic function of the music .
The development of a raga , any composition or song within raga presupposes and requires the continuous sounding of the key-note , its octave and another tone , usually the fifth or fourth .
Traditionally drone is provided by one or more tanpura player , especially for vocal performances .
The electronic tanpura was created as a marketable , practical solution for instrumentalists , having their hands otherwise engaged , who can not readily avail themselves of able tanpura players for their long hours of private practice .
Since the late 1970s , little white boxes appeared , first privately , then gradually coming openly to the stage as the technological sophistication of the models advanced .
In Indian solfege , called Sargam , Sa is the tonic , Ma , Pa and Ni are 4th , 5th and 7th tone degrees within the octave .
Generally , the electronic tanpura has one or more dials to control the tone and volume , and may have other switches and buttons that allow a certain pitch and volume to be saved and used again at a later time .
The range is usually one to two octaves .
For many musicians the electronic tanpura is a practical commodity .
It delivers a passable substitute for a real , live tanpura .
Certainly , it is much easier and less expensive than maintaining a live tanpura player .
However , the electronic tanpura is a poor substitute when compared to a good tanpura in expert hands as the tones it creates lack the dynamics of a live musician , producing a mechanical , repetitive sound .
The electronic tanpura was first invented by G Raj Narayan , an engineer-flautist from Bangalore , India , and demonstrated at the annual conference of the Music Academy Chennai in December 1979 .
 The products were manufactured by the company Raj Narayan founded , Radel .
The first versions were created with the technology then available , using discrete components and transistors .
In the late 1990s , these gave way to models using sampled recordings of the traditional tanpura on a chip .
Over the last decade , these have been further refined and the latest models can hardly be distinguished from a traditional acoustic tanpura .
The success of this invention gave rise to many other players who then started manufacturing and aggressively marketing bad copies of these products .
These copies have earned a bad name as the little white boxes and comparisons are made to the traditional acoustic tanpuras
In Hindustani classical music , vivadi refers to pitches that are not part of the arohana or avrohana of a given raga .
In general , vivadi are not to be played during an improvisation on a given raga .
So , for instance , if a raga had the structure S R G m P D N S , S N D P m G R S ; in that case , r , g , M , d and n would all be vivadi .
Although vivadi pitches are generally to be avoided during the playing of a given raga , they are occasionally added by skilled performers in order to introduce some color to an interpretation .
In Carnatic music , vivadi is used in vivadi swaram , vivadi dhosha , vivadi ragam , and by extension vivadi melakarta .
Vivadi term means going against the grain of thought or approach .
A swaram is said to be vivadi in relationship with another swaram , if there is a discordant effect produced by the swaram in relation to the other .
It is different from Apaswaram , which is incorrect swaram or incorrect rendition / pitch / frequency deviating from the swaram itself .
 A ragam is vivadi if A ragam contains vivadi swarams , especially with the vadi swaram of the ragam .
The ragam still is a valid scale and compositions are made using such ragams too .
Examples of popular Vivadi ragas are : Nata , Varali , Vagadheeswari .
 A Melakarta ragam is vivadi if A Melakarta ragam contains vivadi swarams .
40 of the 72 Melakarta ragams have vivadi swaras .
Dhosha means negative effect .
Vivadi ragams are said to have vivadi dhosha , which can be overcome by singing the vivadi swarams in certain phrases that are said to reduce the negative effect .

Pandit Basavraj Rajguru was born at Yaliwal , a village in the north Karnataka district of Dharwad , a great centre of Hindustani classical music .
 Pandit Basavraj Rajguru was a leading Hindustani vocal musician in the Kirana Gharana .
 Due perhaps to Pandit Basavraj Rajguru aversion for publicity and Pandit Basavraj Rajguru simple and scholarly lifestyle , Pandit Basavraj Rajguru never achieved the level of fame of Pandit Basavraj Rajguru contemporaries Bhimsen Joshi and Gangubai Hangal of the same gharana .
 Pandit Basavraj Rajguru received many awards , including the Padma Bhushan .
 Born into a family of scholars , astrologers and musicians , the young Basavraj was initiated into classical music at an early age by his father , who was himself a renowned Carnatic musician trained in Tanjavur .
Later he travelled widely in search of musical knowledge to which he dedicated his entire life .
He chose to live a quiet life away from glamour and its attendant trappings .
He excelled both as performer and teacher .
 Besides being a great classicalist , Rajaguru was adept at composing and singing vachanas which made his music more accessible to the general public of Karnataka state .
Basavaraj was fond of music from a very young age .
 Basavaraj would try to persuade drama producers and actors to let Basavaraj sing in their plays , and first became known while singing for Vamanrao Master 's traveling drama company .
 When Basavaraj was 13 years old , Basavaraj lost Basavaraj father .
 Basavaraj uncle became concerned about His uncle future in drama .
 By a fortuitous stroke of fate , the blind Ganayogi Panchakshari Gawai discovered the young Basavraj and with little convincing from the MaTh 's swamiji , took the lad into the blind Ganayogi Panchakshari Gawai tutelage .
Since then his music embraced a whole new beginning .
 Panchakshari Gawai gave all the blind Ganayogi Panchakshari Gawai musical knowledge to the young Basavraj and other students who were not in a position to pay guru dakshina to Basavraj and other students guru .
 the blind Ganayogi Panchakshari Gawai mastered several Ragas and styles .
 the blind Ganayogi Panchakshari Gawai also became adept at some other arts like wrestling , swimming and cooking .
 the blind Ganayogi Panchakshari Gawai teacher would personally make sure that each of His teacher students practiced for at least 12 to 15 hours a day .
 When the young Basavraj graduated the young Basavraj asked the young Basavraj guru what the young Basavraj wanted as gurudakshina , and the young Basavraj guru replied that this would consist of Basavraj passing on what he had learnt from his guru to his own disciples .
 In 1936 at the 600th anniversary of the Vijayanagar Empire in Hampi , the young Basavraj gave the young Basavraj first concert with the young Basavraj guru the blind Ganayogi Panchakshari Gawai .
Fifteen thousand people listened silently to the young musician singing Bageshri and the vachana Nijaguna Shivayogi .
 After the passing away of Panchakshari Gawai in 1944 , the young Basavraj moved to Bombay and had the chance to learn from the legendary Kirana musician and teacher Sawai Gandharva .
 But Sawai Gandharva was suffering from paralysis and had to leave Bombay , so teacher Sawai Gandharva told Sureshbabu Mane , another great Kirana musician and Guru of Dr. Prabha Atre , to take good care of the young Basavraj .
 After learning from teacher Sawai Gandharva , Rajaguru quest took teacher Sawai Gandharva to the North West of Pakistan , where teacher Sawai Gandharva learned from Ustad Waheed khan , Gawai 's guru .
 In Karachi teacher Sawai Gandharva learnt from Ustad Latif Khan for six months .
 teacher Sawai Gandharva was not afraid to accept any challenge .
 Once teacher Sawai Gandharva had to sing after Ustad Nishad Khan and teacher Sawai Gandharva went up to the stage confidently and Ustad Nishad Khan had to accept Ustad Nishad Khan defeat from the young Basavraj .
 On another occasion it is reported that Chhote Ghulam sang Raga Todi so well that nobody dared to defeat Chhote Ghulam , but the young Basavraj did .
 During the partition of India and North West of Pakistan in 1947 , Ustad Latif Khan advised Ustad Latif Khan for six months to take a train carrying thousands of Hindus across the border .
 The train was stopped and attacked on the border but the young Basavraj managed to escape by clinging to the bottom of the carriage all the way from the border to Delhi .
 the young Basavraj fame had spread far and wide and continued to spread ; concert invitations came from every corner of the country .
 the young Basavraj repertoire ranged from the pure classical , Dhrupad to Vachanas , Natyageet , Thumri , and Ghazal spanning eight languages .
 the young Basavraj knew more than forty types of raga and the young Basavraj would sing Vachanas one after another right then and there .
 After the young Basavraj concert in Delhi information minister , B.V. Keskar announced , Arre , hamare Rajguru to hukumi yekka hai !

 At another concert Begum Akhtar , declared , Pandit Basavraj Rajguru yane sur ka badshah .
 or Pandit Basavraj Rajguru signifies the king of music .

 Pandit Basavraj Rajguru also received Sangeet Natak Akademi awards from central and state governments .
 Pandit Basavraj Rajguru was also awarded with prestigious titles by various organizations and an honorary doctorate by the Karnataka University , Dharwad .
 Besides being an accomplished and talented singer , Rajaguru was patient and caring towards Rajaguru students .
 Rajaguru would never get tired of repeating taans for Rajaguru students ; Rajaguru would never get angry .
 Rajaguru would always tell Rajaguru students that no matter how great they were , if they couldnt pass on what they had acquired to somebody else , the greatness would be worthless .
 Rajaguru was a strict vegetarian and never even tasted tea in Rajaguru life .
 Rajaguru had a very strict regimen of Puja , sadhna , teaching and walking .
 Rajaguru diet was oriented towards preserving Rajaguru voice and Rajaguru never ate or drank anything fried , frozen or fatty .
 Rajaguru dream of coming to U.S. eluded Rajaguru .
 Rajaguru had planned a concert tour in the U.S. in the fall of 1991 , and Rajaguru got a performer 's visa , but on Rajaguru way back to Dharwad Rajaguru had a minor heart attack and was admitted to a hospital in Bangalore .
 Rajaguru disciple , Nachiketa Sharma was beside Nachiketa Sharma when Nachiketa Sharma breathed Nachiketa Sharma last .

Tappa is a form of Indian semi-classical vocal music .
Its specialty is its rolling pace based on fast , subtle and knotty construction .
Its tunes are melodious , sweet and depict the emotional outbursts of a lover .
Tappas were sung mostly by songstresses , known as Baigees , in royal courts .
Tappa originated from the folk songs of the camel riders of Punjab , the Tappa style of music was refined and introduced to the imperial court of the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah .
And later on by Mian Ghulam Nabi Shori or Shori Mian , a court singer of Asaf-Ud-Dowlah , Nawab of Awadh .
 In Bengal , Ramnidhi Gupta composed Bengali tappas and Bengali tappas are called as Nidhu Babus Tappa .
 Tappa gayaki took new shape and over decades became puratani , a semi-classical form of Bengali songs .
 Nidhu Babus Tappa , as a significant genre in Bengali musical styles , reached levels of excellence in lyrics and rendition , arguably unmatched in other parts of India .
Hugely popular in the latter half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th , Tappa was the genre of choice of the wealthy elite as well as the classes with more modest means .
An evolved format of the tappa was the baithaki style , which evolved under the direct patronage of the landed elites of the zamindari classes of the late 19th and early 20th centuries , in their baithak-khanas and jalsaghar .
Composers of repute included Bidyasundar , Roopchaand Pakkhi , Dadathakur , Hiralal Sarkhel and many others .
Unfortunately , tappa being mainly a vocal tradition , a lot of priceless material from the body of art has been lost in the passage of time .
A lot of celebrated artists have passed away before recordings of music became common .
What is left today is mainly handed down from the generations by oral traditions as well as some written matter , occasionally turned up in the course of research .
 Ramkumar Chattopadhyay was perhaps the most significant vocal proponent in recent times , of the tappa style in Bengal , renowned for Ramkumar Chattopadhyay semi-humorous and majorly artistic renditions and Ramkumar Chattopadhyay comical incorporation of English into the Bengali lyrics , either Ramkumar Chattopadhyay own translations or Ramkumar Chattopadhyay anecdotal translations based on prior sources , ostensibly for the comprehension of the British sahibs in the British Raj era , but containing many subversive and sarcastic tones in the English transliterations , clearly against the Imperial regime , but subtly put so as not to arouse the suspicion of the strict and sensitive colonial government and invite charges of sedition .

Among the prominent living performers of this style are Pt .
Laxmanrao Pandit of Gwalior , Shanno Khurana , Pt .
 Manvalkar of Gwalior , Girija Devi of Benaras , Dr. Ishwarchandra R. Karkare of Gwalior , Smt .
Malini Rajurkar , Shri .
Sharad Sathe , Manjiri Asnare Kelkar of Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana and Pandit Yashpaul of the Agra Gharana .
 In Bengal , there is a current resurgence of the tappa , with fresh talent beginning to carve out their niches , such as Riddhi , Srikumar Chattopadhyay , Pritam Bhattacharjee , and many others

Mohammad Sabir Baburaj , also known as M. S. Baburaj , was a Malayalam music composer .
 Mohammad Sabir Baburaj is often credited for the renaissance of Malayalam film music .
 Mohammad Sabir Baburaj has rendered music to many evergreen Malayalam film songs .
 Mohammad Sabir Baburaj was born on 29 March 1921 in Kozhikode , then known as Calicut .
 Mohammad Sabir Baburaj early childhood was spent in destitution and poverty .
 Mohammad Sabir Baburaj father , Jan Muhammed Khan , who was a Hindustani musician from Bengal who frequently held concerts in Kerala , deserted Jan Muhammed Khan Malayali mother when Jan Muhammed Khan was very young , and returned to Jan Muhammed Khan native Kolkata .
 Mohammad Sabir Baburaj thus became a fatherless , often singing songs in trains to make a living .
 But as luck would have it , a policeman , Kunjahammed , an enthusiast of music , from his native town of Kozhikode , noticing the boys vocal talents , decided to virtually adopt him .
 One of his greatest achievements was the introduction of Hindustani strains into Malayalam popular music .
 He successfully composed melodies based on Hindustani Ragas and blended Malayalam lyrics into them .
 Most of the lyrics were written by eminent Malayalam poets like P. Bhaskaran and Vayalar .
 Mohammad Sabir Baburaj learned basic lessons of Hindustani music from Mohammad Sabir Baburaj father from a very young age , but Mohammad Sabir Baburaj could not learn Hindustani music for long due to Mohammad Sabir Baburaj fathers demise .
In search of pure music , young Baburaj visited West Bengal , Mumbai and Sri Lanka .
 Mohammad Sabir Baburaj learned Harmonium in these period .
 Mohammad Sabir Baburaj came back to Kerala to a miserable life .
 Mohammad Sabir Baburaj sang on the streets of Kozhikode to earn Mohammad Sabir Baburaj livelihood.Police constable Kunju Muhammed , who was a fan of Baburajs father adopted Baburajs father and brought up .
 Later Mohammad Sabir Baburaj started composing music for the Malayalam dramas in the Malabar region and thus slowly entered the field of music direction .
 In 1957 , Mohammad Sabir Baburaj composed music for the Malayalam film `` Minnaminungu '' , by Ramu Kariat , thus entered the Malayalam film industry .
 Mohammad Sabir Baburaj was also an accomplished singer and harmonium player .
 Mohammad Sabir Baburaj died an early death , on 7 October 1978 at the age of 57 .
 Mohammad Sabir Baburaj was survived by Mohammad Sabir Baburaj wife and children .
 The Baburaj - P. Bhaskaran - K. J. Yesudas combination produced many of the most memorable tunes of the 60s and 70s .
 Most of Mohammad Sabir Baburaj classic duets were sung by K. J. Yesudas & S. Janaki , each recording solo Baburaj compositions as well .
The Baburaj - S. Janaki partnership is sometimes compared to that of Madan Mohan and Lata Mangeshkar combination of Hindi Music .
 Many of Baburajs songs remain wildly popular in Kerala to date , with songs like Oru Pushpam Maatram frequently rendered on stage at various events .
 The Manorama Music company , chanced upon an old audio cassette of Mohammad Sabir Baburaj rendering some of Mohammad Sabir Baburaj own compositions .
 The Manorama Music company was recorded during one of those heady musical evenings that Mohammad Sabir Baburaj and Mohammad Sabir Baburaj friends occasionally indulged in , towards the end 1960s , when most Mohammad Sabir Baburaj greatest hits were composed .
The cassette was re-mixed and became an instant hit .
The tracks gave Kerala a rejuvenated taste of Baburajs music .
 Though a successful composer , Mohammad Sabir Baburaj was never a careerist .
 Today , various clubs and musical organisations conduct stage programs in honor of Mohammad Sabir Baburaj , and hand over the proceeds to Mohammad Sabir Baburaj family.As with the case with many erstwhile musical geniuses , Mohammad Sabir Baburaj concentrated solely on Mohammad Sabir Baburaj music .
 During Mohammad Sabir Baburaj time , money was not easy to come for artists , and Mohammad Sabir Baburaj was never managed to earn much , dying a poor mans death .
 ` Thrikkakkare theerthakkare ' in the 1978 film ` Yagaswam ' directed by Hariharan was Hariharan last recorded song .

In Concert 1972 is a double live album by sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar and sarodya Ali Akbar Khan , released in 1973 on Apple Records .
 Concert 1972 was recorded at the Philharmonic Hall , New York City , in October 1972 , and is a noted example of the two Hindustani classical musicians celebrated jugalbandi style of playing .
With accompaniment from tabla player Alla Rakha , the performance reflects the two artists sorrow at the recent death of their revered guru , and Khans father , Allauddin Khan .
 The latter was responsible for many innovations in Indian music during the twentieth century , including the call-and-response dialogue that musicians such as Ravi Shankar , multi-instrumentalist Allauddin Khan and Alla Rakha popularised among Western audiences in the 1960s .
 The album features three ragas , including Raga Sindhi Bhairavi , which Ali Akbar Khan had previously interpreted on Ali Akbar Khan landmark recording .
 In Concert 1972 1972 has received critical acclaim ; Ken Hunt of Gramophone magazine describes Gramophone magazine as a sometimes smouldering , sometimes fiery , masterpiece and the living , fire-breathing embodiment of one of the greatest partnerships ever forged in Hindustani music .
 Ali Akbar Khan and Ravi Shankar trained in the Maihar gharana under multi-instrumentalist Allauddin Khan and Devis father , the teacher and multi-instrumentalist Allauddin Khan .
Known as Baba , the latter is recognised as one of the great Indian classical music innovators of the twentieth century , having composed up to 600 pieces of music and been responsible for modernising two of its most important string instruments - the sitar and the sarod .
 Author Peter Lavazzoli credits Babas various contributions as having shaped ... much of what the West knows as Indian classical music via Ravi Shankar and Khans subsequent work .
 Of the two musicians , multi-instrumentalist Allauddin Khan , as a master sarodya , was the first to achieve international recognition , with a visit to New York that culminated in multi-instrumentalist Allauddin Khan 1955 album .
 The latter was the first album of Indian classical music , While highly regarded as solo artists , Ravi Shankar and Khans duets , known as jugalbandi , were similarly acclaimed from the 1950s onwards .
Music critic Ken Hunt writes of the tigerish potential for male and female dialogue in their jugalbandi combination .
 Compared to the more traditional musical path adopted by multi-instrumentalist Allauddin Khan , Born in East Bengal , multi-instrumentalist Allauddin Khan joined Shankar on stage at Madison Square Garden , New York , in August 1971 for the Concert for Bangladesh , organised by Harrison .
 Just over a year afterwards , on 8 October 1972 , Ravi Shankar and multi-instrumentalist Allauddin Khan were recorded at another New York venue , the Philharmonic Hall , accompanied again by Alla Rakha .
 Ravi Shankar often commented on the warm reception afforded Ravi Shankar by audiences in America , where New York had been the first Western city to embrace Indian music .
 As at the Bangladesh shows , there was a poignancy to this 1972 performance , following the death of Allauddin Khan in September that year .
 As audiences in America music guru , Baba had remained a revered figure in audiences in America lives , and a man considered a saint in his home town of Maihar .
 In My Music , My Life , Shankars 1968 autobiography , he writes admiringly of Baba followa way of life that was a beautiful fusion of the best of both Hinduism and Islam , and being similarly broadminded in his musical vision by -LSB- leading us away from the confines of narrow specialization that prevailed in our music .
 The ensuing duet at the Philharmonic Hall was a passionate musical exchange between Ravi Shankar and multi-instrumentalist Allauddin Khan , a performance that far surpasses a tribute frozen in time , according to Music critic Ken Hunt .
 In a role that Ravi Shankar had introduced as an ambassador for Indian classical music , Ravi Shankar first addressed the New York audience , to explain what the loss of Allauddin Khan meant to Indian music .
 Providing the drone-like accompaniment behind Ravi Shankar and multi-instrumentalist Allauddin Khan during the concert were two tambura players , named as Ashoka and Susan on the album credits .
 Lavezzoli writes of Shankars longstanding association with Lavezzoli tabla player that Alla Rakha was the ideal partner , given the drummers broad training .
 Continuing Babas efforts to elevate tabla from Shankars longstanding association previous , secondary status , Ravi Shankar allowed the drums more space in Ravi Shankar performances , ensuring that the tabla became recognised as a solo instrument .
 Hem Bihag , an evening raga , was followed by a night raga , Manj Khamaj , a piece that had appeared on Shankars At the Woodstock Festival live album .
The final selection was a morning raga , Sindhi Bhairavi .
 multi-instrumentalist Allauddin Khan had recorded this piece as side one of Music of India , and Ravi Shankar similarly included it on The Sounds of India , a 1957 album that Lavezzoli describes as Lavezzoli own counterpart to Khans debut release .
The Philharmonic Hall recording became In Concert 1972 , made up of the three ragas spread over four LP sides and totalling over 140 minutes of music .
 An Apple Records release via Shankars friendship with Harrison , the double album was produced in London by Harrison midway through sessions for his Living in the Material World album .
Harrisons co-producers were Rakhas son Zakir Hussain , and sound engineer Phil McDonald .
Apple Records issued In Concert 1972 in January 1973 in the United States , and three months later in Britain .
Billboard magazine carried an Apple trade ad with a tagline beginning : Within the small community of Brilliantly Gifted Musicians there exists an even smaller world of Masters .
 Two of these masters recently joined together in concert ... The double album appeared at the same time as a flurry of other Apple releases , some of Gifted Musicians two-record sets also , in the case of Yoko Ono s Approximately Infinite Universe and the Beatles compilations 1962-1966 and 1967-1970 .
Despite such an output of product , the label was being wound down from this point on .
 In Concert 1972 was the final Shankar-related release on Apple Records , following Shankar-related Joi Bangla EP and Raga film soundtrack and the Concert for Bangladesh triple album , all issued in 1971 .
 By the time In Concert 1972 was available in the UK , in April 1973 , Ravi Shankar , Harrison , Alla Rakha and Khans sarod-playing son Aashish were working in Los Angeles on the Shankar Family & Friends album .
The latter , which would be a Dark Horse Records release , was remastered and reissued in 2010 as part of the Ravi Shankar-George Harrison , Collaborations box set , at the same time as Shankars East Meets West Music reissued the equally rare Raga documentary and soundtrack album .
 In Concert 1972 1972 was not included in these reissue projects , but Concert 1972 was released on CD as part of Apples 1996-97 repackaging campaign .
The 2004 two-CD version reunited the two halves of Raga Manj Khamaj .
 Rough Guides world music guidebook lists In Concert 1972 among The 2004 two-CD version very selective highlights of all Shankars releases , and writes of the live album : Pyrotechnics and profundity recorded in New York , matching sitar and sarod in Hindustani musics greatest jugalbandi .
In a piece written not long after the death of Ali Akbar Khan in June 2009 , MusicTraveler website described the album as absolutely mesmerising .
 Some commentators have written that Khans sarod playing surpassed that of Ali Akbar Khan in June 2009 father , Noting the reverence afforded Baba for his contributions to the genre , Rough Guide remarks on such comparisons : While it is considered unpardonable even to whisper it , many consider the more elevating player .
Reviewing the Apple CD in June 1997 , Ken Hunt enthused in Gramophone magazine : This is the living , fire-breathing embodiment of one of the greatest partnerships ever forged in Hindustani classical music .
 Some commentators sarod-sitar brotherhood had begun under Some commentators guru during the 1940s .
 By the 1950s Some commentators combination of the robust , steel-clad sarod and the delicate sitar was highly acclaimed and in 1972 Some commentators was undoubtably the hottest ticket in Hindustani heaven ... Two musicians pouring their hearts out for their guru : that is the most succinct description of this sometimes smouldering , sometimes fiery , masterpiece .
Few Hindustani reissues - or new releases - will match its white-hot heat of creativity this year

Allmusic s Daniel Gioffre described the instrument as a hybrid between a guitar and a vichitra veena , performed with a metal slide moving across steel rods along the neck .

Author George Plasketes described Bhatts playing as highly nuanced while Cooder performs in a more loose-jointed , slip n slide style .
 According to Daniel Gioffre , Cooder and Bhatt use improvisation and voice-like phrasing , showing melodic performances in an alternating fashion and in unison .
The album contains four tracks , three of which were credited to Cooder and Bhatt , ranging in length from approximately seven and a half to twelve minutes .
Longing has a structure similar to a raga .
Author Tom Moon noted that Cooder takes the lead on the hymn Isa Lei as Bhatt contributes elaborate squiggling asides and swooping nosedives .
In 2011 , Bhatt performed A Meeting by the River at a music festival in honor of guru Kelucharan Mohapatra .
Bhatt said of the song : Music has no religion and no geographical or linguistic barrier .
It speaks a universal language .
My composition - A Meeting by the River - aims at explaining this .
Bhatt has stated that he considers working with Cooder his most special collaboration .
 Daniel Gioffre wrote a positive review for the album and called Cooder and Bhatt genuine masters of Cooder and Bhatt respective instruments .
 Daniel Gioffre described the musical interplay between the musicians as nothing short of astounding and the album as a rare instance in which a combination of genres works .
 Furthermore , Daniel Gioffre wrote : this album is masterfully recorded ; each instrument is clear , distinct , and three-dimensional sounding .
A Meeting by the River is a must-own , a thing of pure , unadulterated beauty , and the strongest record in Cooders extensive catalog .
Peter Margasak of the Chicago Tribune awarded the album four out of four stars , describing Cooders performance as arresting and Bhatts haunting .
 Peter Margasak of the Chicago Tribune wrote that the fusion revealed a rare , often transcendental beauty as the two artists gently and intuitively found common ground .
 Rolling Stone called the album fruitful and awarded an album by Ry Cooder three out of five stars .
A Meeting by the River reached a peak position of number four on Billboard Top World Music Albums chart .
In 1994 , the album earned Cooder and Bhatt Grammy Awards for Best World Music Album .
Bhatt became one of a few Indian musicians to have received a Grammy Award ; until A. R. Rahman won at the 52nd Grammy Awards in 2010 , previous Indian award winners had been recognized jointly with Western artists .
 The February 25 , 1995 issue of Billboard Top World Music Albums , which featured the annual Indies Spotlight and covered independent music between the January 29 , 1994 and January 21 , 1995 issues of the magazine , included A Meeting by the River at number ten on The February 25 list of the Top Indie World Music Albums .
The album is included in Tom Moons 2008 book 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die : A Listeners Life List .

 Prior to his brother James Slovak death of a heroin overdose in 1988 , Slovak recorded two albums with the band , Freaky Styley and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan .
 his brother James Slovak guitar work was primarily rooted in funk and hard rock , although his brother James Slovak often experimented with other genres including reggae and speed metal .
 his brother James Slovak is considered to have been a major influence on the Red Hot Chili Peppers early sound .
 Born in Haifa , Israel , Slovak immigrated with his brother James Slovak family to the United States when he was five years old .
Slovak met future band mates Anthony Kiedis , Flea , and Jack Irons while attending school in Los Angeles .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis joined the group afterwards Anthym along with former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons while attending Fairfax High School ; Flea would later join the group , which later changed Flea name to What Is This ?

 Slovak , Flea , audience member Anthony Kiedis , and former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons started Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1983 , which became popular in the Los Angeles area , playing various shows around the city .
 However , Slovak quit the band to focus on What is This ?
 , which had gotten a record deal , leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers to record This debut album without audience member Anthony Kiedis .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1985 , and recorded the albums Freaky Styley and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan with the band .
 During audience member Anthony Kiedis career , Slovak developed a serious heroin addiction .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis attempted to quit the drug many times , but ultimately succumbed to audience member Anthony Kiedis addiction , dying of an overdose on June 25 , 1988 at age 26 .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis was replaced by guitarist John Frusciante , who was greatly influenced by Slovaks playing style .
Several Red Hot Chili Peppers songs have been written as tributes to Slovak , including Knock Me Down and My Lovely Man .
 In 1999 , My Lovely Man brother James Slovak published a book entitled Behind the Sun : The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak , which features Slovaks diaries and paintings .
 Slovak was inducted into the the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on April 14 , 2012 , with a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers brother accepting on a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers behalf .
 Hillel Slovak was born in Haifa , Israel , to Jewish parents who were survivors of the Holocaust .
 his brother James Slovak mother was of Polish descent and his brother James Slovak father of Croatian descent .
The family emigrated to the U.S. when Slovak was five years old .
They settled in the Queens borough of New York City , then in 1967 relocated to Southern California .
As a child , Slovak developed an interest in art , and would often spend time painting with his mother , Esther .
He attended Laurel Elementary School in West Hollywood and Bancroft Jr. .
 High School in West Hollywood , where he met future bandmates Jack Irons and Michael Flea Balzary .
Slovak received his first guitar at age 13 as a bar mitzvah present , and would often play the instrument into the late hours of the night .
During this time , he was highly influenced by hard rock music such as Jimi Hendrix , Led Zeppelin , and Kiss .
 As a freshman at Fairfax High School , Slovak formed a band with former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons on drums and two other high school friends , Alain Johannes and Todd Strassman .
They called their band Chain Reaction , then changed the name to What is This ?
after their first gig .
 After one of the groups shows , Slovak met audience member Anthony Kiedis , and invited audience member Anthony Kiedis to audience member Anthony Kiedis house for a snack .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis later described the experience in audience member Anthony Kiedis autobiography Scar Tissue : Within a few minutes of hanging out with Hillel who first got me into hard rockin , I sensed that audience member Anthony Kiedis was absolutely different from most of the people Id spent time with ... audience member Anthony Kiedis understood a lot about music , audience member Anthony Kiedis was a great visual artist , and audience member Anthony Kiedis had a sense of self and a calm about him that were just riveting .
 Slovak , audience member Anthony Kiedis and Flea became best friends and often used LSD , heroin , cocaine and methamphetamine recreationally .
 Anthyms original bassist was deemed unsatisfactory , so Slovak began teaching Flea to play bass .
Following several months of commitment to the instrument , Flea developed proficiency and a strong musical chemistry with Slovak .
 When Todd Strassman saw Flea playing Anthym songs on Todd Strassman equipment Todd Strassman quit the band , with Flea quickly replacing Todd Strassman .
Shortly afterwards Anthym entered a local Battle of the Bands contest and won second place .
 afterwards Anthym started to play at local nightclubs , despite the fact that the members were all underage .
After graduating from high school , the band changed their name to What Is This ?

 Flea left afterwards Anthym around this time to accept an offer of playing bass in the prominent L.A. punk band Fear .
 What Is This ?
 continued on and performed many shows along the Southern California coast .
 Slovak , audience member Anthony Kiedis , and Flea began to create Slovak , Flea , Kiedis , and Irons own music after finding inspiration in a punk-funk fusion band called Defunkt .
The three formed a band with former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons called Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem .
 The band had only one song , entitled Out in L.A. , and was formed for the purpose of playing the song once .
 The song was based on a guitar riff that Slovak wrote while jamming with former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons , and was not meant to become a real song until audience member Anthony Kiedis decided to rap over the music .
Following the groups first show at The Rhythm Lounge , the owner of the bar asked them to return , but with two songs instead of one .
After several more shows , and the addition of several songs to their repertoire , the bands name was changed to Red Hot Chili Peppers .
 After the band started to gain popularity amongst the L.A. club scene , audience member Anthony Kiedis began writing more The lyrics .
The lyrics would eventually become songs such as Green Heaven and True Men Dont Kill Coyotes , and the bands concert repertoire quickly grew to nine songs as a result of months of playing local nightclubs and bars .
 Over the course of the next six months , the Red Hot Chili Peppers played many shows in L.A. clubs and became something of an underground hit .
 Slovak , audience member Anthony Kiedis , and Flea moved into a small house in a high-crime area in West Hollywood where Slovak , Flea , Kiedis , and Irons collaborated musically and continued Slovak , Flea , Kiedis , and Irons drug addictions .
The threesome traveled to New York City to perform more shows and to spread Chili Pepperdom .
 Shortly after the trip , Slovak moved out of the groups shared house to live with Chili Pepperdom girlfriend .
The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape and subsequently secured a record deal with EMI .
Flea left Fear to pursue the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
At the same time , What is This ?
had also gotten a record deal .
 Since Slovak considered the Chili Peppers to merely be a side project and not a serious commitment , he left This to concentrate on What is This ?
 Flea ultimately respected the decision , but felt the band would suffer musically without This .
 He and audience member Anthony Kiedis hired drummer Cliff Martinez and guitarist Jack Sherman to fill former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons and Slovaks places , respectively .
 During the recording of the second What is This ?
album , Slovak became frustrated with the band and contacted Flea about rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
 This came at an opportune time , as the group was dissatisfied with Slovaks replacement , Jack Sherman .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis felt that Shermans guitar work didnt have the same spirit that Slovak contributed to the bands sound .
 When Flea asked Kiedis how audience member Anthony Kiedis felt about Slovak rejoining the band , audience member Anthony Kiedis responded by saying Id give I firstborn son to get him back in the band .
 After the culmination of the promotional tour for This first album , guitarist Jack Sherman was fired and Slovak rejoined the band .
 Slovak returned to the Chili Peppers for This second album , Freaky Styley , which was released on August 16 , 1985 .
What is This ?
 had finally disbanded , and former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons returned to the Chili Peppers in mid 1986 after Cliff Martinez was fired .
 Flea , Slovak and audience member Anthony Kiedis especially were involved in heavy drug use and This relationships became strained .
 Flea recalled that it began to seem ugly to I and not fun ; our communication was not healthy .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis became dependent on heroin , leaving the rest of the group to work on much of the albums material by themselves .
 The band lived in Detroit for a portion of the recording of the album , where audience member Anthony Kiedis and Slovak indulged in heavy cocaine use .
 When Slovak was under the influence , audience member Anthony Kiedis would often wear brightly colored clothing and dance in a shuffling fashion , which became the inspiration for the song Skinny Sweaty Man from the bands next album .
 After audience member Anthony Kiedis completed a stint in rehab , audience member Anthony Kiedis rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan .
 Slovak felt a deep connection to the album ; audience member Anthony Kiedis reflected in audience member Anthony Kiedis diary It was so fun .
 Im so extremely proud of everybodys work - Im so extremely proud of everybodys is at times genius .
 Slovak was the subject of the songs Skinny Sweaty Man , I and I Friends , & No Chump Love Sucker .
 the song Skinny Sweaty Man was nicknamed Slim Bob Billy , Slim , or Huckleberry , and throughout the albums audience member Anthony Kiedis calls audience member Anthony Kiedis by these nicknames before audience member Anthony Kiedis starts a guitar solo .
On The Uplift Mofo Party Plan , Slovak experimented with different musical styles , playing the sitar on the song Behind the Sun .
 Slovak and audience member Anthony Kiedis became addicted to heroin early in Slim Bob Billy , Slim , or Huckleberry careers , and Slovak often attempted to conceal his brother James Slovak addiction from his brother James Slovak friends and family .
 The band generally was more worried about Kiediss addiction , which was much more open and noticeable to the other members , while Slovak was much more subtle and much more cunning in Kiediss disguise .
During the tour in support of Freaky Styley , Slovaks health began to deteriorate .
 Slovak and Flea would wrestle regularly on tour , but Slovak became too weak to participate .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis commented on the situation : I could tell that Hillel who first got me into hard rockin had no inner core of strength ; audience member Anthony Kiedis had been robbed by audience member Anthony Kiedis addiction of the life force that allows you to at least defend yourself .
It was a sad moment .
 A roadie of the band who was concerned for Slovaks health contacted his brother , his brother James Slovak , who had been unaware that Slovak had ever used heroin .
 Deciding to give sobriety a chance , both audience member Anthony Kiedis and Slovak stopped using drugs prior to both Kiedis and Slovak European tour in support of The Uplift Mofo Party Plan , and decided to help each other steer clear of heroin .
 An entry from Slovaks diary on January 21 , 1988 discusses audience member Anthony Kiedis attempts to begin a new drug-free phase of life .
 During the tour both experienced intense heroin withdrawal , with Slovak much more unstable than audience member Anthony Kiedis .
 Slovak much more unstable withdrawal symptoms took a toll on Slovak much more unstable ability to play Slovak much more unstable instrument ; at one point Slovak had a mental breakdown and was unable to play a show , leaving the rest of the band to play an entire set with no guitar .
 Slovak much more unstable recovered a few days later , but was briefly kicked out of the band and replaced by DeWayne McKnight for a few shows .
 After a few days with DeWayne McKnight for a few shows , the band decided to give Slovak another chance , and DeWayne McKnight for a few shows rejoined for the European leg of the tour .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis attempted to take Slovak to drug addiction counseling , but Slovak had difficulty admitting that audience member Anthony Kiedis addiction was serious enough to require medical help .
 Upon returning home , Slovak isolated audience member Anthony Kiedis from the rest of audience member Anthony Kiedis bandmates , and struggled to resist the drug without the support of audience member Anthony Kiedis friends , and Kiedis in particular .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis stopped painting and writing in audience member Anthony Kiedis diary during this time , and little is known about audience member Anthony Kiedis life the weeks following the tour , aside from a phone call to audience member Anthony Kiedis brother on June 24 , in which Slovak told audience member Anthony Kiedis that audience member Anthony Kiedis was having difficulty staying clean despite audience member Anthony Kiedis desire to stop taking heroin .
A few weeks after the band returned from the tour , the members attempted to contact Slovak , but were unable to for several days .
 Slovak was found dead by police in audience member Anthony Kiedis Hollywood apartment on June 27 , 1988 .
 After police in his Hollywood apartment autopsy , authorities determined that police in his Hollywood apartment had died two days earlier due to a heroin overdose .
 police in his Hollywood apartment is interred at Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Hollywood Hills , Southern California .
 Following Slovaks death audience member Anthony Kiedis fled town and did not attend the funeral , considering the situation to be surreal and dreamlike .
 Although audience member Anthony Kiedis found the death to be a shock , audience member Anthony Kiedis initially was not scared straight and continued to use heroin .
 However , a few weeks later audience member Anthony Kiedis friend convinced him both to check into rehab and visit Slovaks grave , which inspired him to get clean for five years .
 former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons was unable to cope with Slovaks death and subsequently quit the band , saying that former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons did not want to be part of something that resulted in the death of former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons friend .
 former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons has suffered from severe depression since Slovaks death .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis and Flea decided to continue making music , hoping to continue what Slovak helped build .
Slovak was primarily influenced by hard rock artists such as Jimi Hendrix , Santana , and Led Zeppelin .
 Jimi Hendrix , Led Zeppelin playing method was highly based on improvisation , a style commonly used in funk music .
 Jimi Hendrix , Led Zeppelin also was noted for Jimi Hendrix , Led Zeppelin aggressive playing style ; Jimi Hendrix , Led Zeppelin would often play with such force that Jimi Hendrix , Led Zeppelin fingers would come apart .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis observed that audience member Anthony Kiedis playing evolved during audience member Anthony Kiedis time away from the group in What is This ?
 , with Slovak adopting a more fluid style featuring sultry elements as opposed to Slovak adopting a more fluid style original hard rock techniques .
On Uplift , Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including reggae and speed metal .
 Slovak adopting a more fluid style guitar riffs would often serve as the basis of the groups songs , with the other members writing This parts to complement Slovak adopting a more fluid style guitar work .
 Slovak adopting a more fluid style melodic riff featured in the song Behind the Sun inspired the group to create pretty songs with an emphasis on melody .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis describes the song as pure Hillel who first got me into hard rockin inspiration .
 Slovak also used a talk box on songs such as Green Heaven and Funky Crime , in which the sounds of audience member Anthony Kiedis amplified guitar would be played through a tube into audience member Anthony Kiedis mouth and then back into a microphone , creating psychedelic voice-like effects .
Slovak helped to incorporate new sounds in the groups work , including adding occasional drum machines .
 Despite the fact that the group billed itself as The Organic Anti-Beat Box Band , audience member Anthony Kiedis states that Slovak showed the group that drum machines could be used as artistic instruments .
Slovaks work was one of the major contributing factors to the Red Hot Chili Peppers early sound .
 When audience member Anthony Kiedis and Flea were searching for a new guitarist to replace Slovak , audience member Anthony Kiedis likened the experience to shopping for a new Mom and Dad because of audience member Anthony Kiedis influence over the band .
 Flea , who originally listened exclusively to jazz , added that Slovak introduced audience member Anthony Kiedis to a new genre of music , saying that it was Hillel who first got I into hard rockin .
 audience member Anthony Kiedis was also a huge influence on a young John Frusciante , who would later replace audience member Anthony Kiedis as guitarist in the band .
 Frusciante based a lot of his playing style on Slovaks work , and explained , I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillels playing and I just took it sideways from there .
Just like Slovak before him , Frusciante developed a heroin addiction .
Unlike Slovak , Frusciante eventually managed to break and defeat the habit .
The songs Knock Me Down and My Lovely Man were written as tributes to Slovak .
In 1999 , a book titled Behind the Sun : The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak was published .
 The book was authored by Slovaks brother , James Slovak , and features writings from his brothers diaries , paintings , photos and hand written notes from audience member Anthony Kiedis and Flea .
On December 7 , 2011 , the Red Hot Chili Peppers were announced as 2012 inductees to the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame .
 In an interview with Rolling Stone , audience member Anthony Kiedis expressed audience member Anthony Kiedis excitement with Slovaks induction , explaining Hes a beautiful person that picked up a guitar in the 1970s and didnt make it out of the 1980s , and audience member Anthony Kiedis is getting honored for audience member Anthony Kiedis beauty .
 Flea echoed those comments on the same day : Hillel who first got me into hard rockin grew up loving rock and roll so much , audience member Anthony Kiedis has n't been here for some time , but I know how much it would mean to audience member Anthony Kiedis .
It 's a powerful thing

Imrat Khan is a leading sitar and surbahar player .
 Imrat Khan is the younger brother of sitar maestro Ustad Vilayat Khan .
 Imrat was born in Calcutta into a family of musicians tracing Calcutta pedigree back for several generations , to the court musicians of the Mughal rulers .
His father was Enayat Khan , recognised as a leading sitar and surbahar player of his time , as had been his grandfather , Imdad Khan , before him .
His father died when Imrat was a child , so he was raised by his mother , Bashiran Begum and her father , singer Bande Hassan Khan .
In 1944 , the family moved with rising star Vilayat Khan , Imrats elder brother , to Bombay where both the brothers learned extensively from uncle Wahid Khan , Enayat Khans brother .
 Wahid Khan was one of the greatest surbahar players of Wahid Khan generation and a top-level sitar player , and taught Imrat on the instruments in the family style , known as the Imdadkhani gharana , or Etawah Gharana , after a village outside Agra where Imdad Khan lived .
 In 1952 Vilayat and Imrat moved in together in Calcutta .
 Vilayat and Imrat performed together for many years .
 From the 1960s onwards , Imrat has performed and recorded solo , playing both sitar and surbahar .
 For decades , Imrat has recorded extensively on both Imrat instruments .
 Imrat full performance practice starts with a surbahar alap in dhrupad ang , followed by a shorter alap on the sitar leading into gat in traditional Imdadkhani style .

He has toured in Europe , the Americas , and East and Southeast Asia .
 Surbahar players are rare today , and Imrat is the main living exponent .
 Imrat has five sons , Nishat , Irshad , Wajahat and Shafaatullah , and Azmat Khan , now only eight ; the first four sons are all classical musicians : Nishat plays the sitar , Wajahat concentrates on the sarod and Shafaatullah is accomplished on sitar , tabla , and surbahar .
The surbahar tradition is largely upheld by Irshad , who has made some very traditional solo recordings .

 In addition to Imrat Khan sons , Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones and George Harrison of The Beatles have been some of Nishat famous students

The Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav is an annual Indian Classical music festival held in Pune since 1953 .
Arguably the largest , most popular , and sought-after Indian Classical music festival in the world , the festival is hosted by the Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal and initiated by Pt .
Bhimsen Joshi as a memorial music conference commemorating the life and work of Pt .
Joshis guru , Pt .
Sawai Gandharva alias Rambhau Kundgolkar , the festivals namesake .
While Pt .
Joshi was leading the organization of the festival , performing artists received personal invitations from Pt .
Joshi to perform at the festival .
With an emphasis on Hidustani Classical Khayal music , instrumentalists , dancers , dhrupadiyas , Bhakti musicians , Ghazal musicians , Qawwaliyas , and Carnatic musicians frequent the concert lineup .
 A younger artists debut performance at the festival connotes A younger artists arrival and promise to the Classical music scene of India .
Since its inception , the festival has grown into a prominent cultural soiree for Punes musical connoisseurs , featuring the foremost musicians of traditional Indian musical forms .
The festival was started in 1953 on a small scale , to commemorate the first death anniversary of Pt .
Sawai Gandharva , the acclaimed Hindustani Classical vocalist of the Kirana Gharana .
The festival played a key role in the development of Hindustani Classical music in Indias post-independence cultural history .
Prior to Indian Independence , Hindustani Classical musicians were supported by monarchs under patronage as court musicians since the beginning of the Mughal Empire .
 After independence , the political division between India and Pakistan culturally alienated many Hindustani musicians .
 The newfound Indian Republic resulted in an end to the patronage of many Hindustani musicians .
 Classical musicians were forced to find new methods of sustaining Hindustani Classical musicians and Hindustani Classical musicians art .
 Public performances of Classical musicians rose as a result , where the Sawai Gandharva Music Festival played an integral role in establishing a regional audience for Indian Classical music .
Within the first several decades following Indian Independence , a great number of music festivals or music conferences were founded in order to provide a platform for Classical musicians to perform .
Pt .
Bhimsen Joshi was leading the organization of the festival since its beginning until 2002 when his health problems became of concern .
Following , Pt .
Joshis youngest son , Shrinivas Joshi , and senior disciple , Shrikant Deshpande , succeeded Pt .
Joshi in organizing the music conference .
Since Bhimsen Joshi s death in 2011 , Shrinivas Joshi and Anand Deshmukh have been leading organizers of the music conference .
The festival was initiated specifically to showcase performers of the Kirana Gharana and started on a small scale .
 Gharana-specific music festivals were popular at the time because many Hindustani musicians wanted to commercialize many Hindustani musicians Gharana style and A younger artists .
Pt .
 Bhimsen Joshi was instrumental in inviting many Hindustani musicians from varying backgrounds to the festival because of his own appreciation and reverence for diverse approaches to presenting Indian Classical music .
 By the late 1970s , the festival established itself as a festival that had the fullest representation of the Classical music temperament in India .
As a result , the festival has become an annual event for music connoisseurs worldwide and reinforces the modernity of Indian Classical Music .
 The 2009 the Sawai Gandharva Music Festival was postponed to January 2010 due to an H1N1 scare in Pune .
This was the first instance in festival history of any kind of postponement .
Recently , many festival regulars have criticized the festivals growing commercial success for causing a decrease in musical quality .
Many attribute this to Pt .
Bhimsen Joshis retirement from organizing the festival after 2002 .
At the 59th festival in 2011 , the performances of senior musicians like Utd .
Amjad Ali Khan and Dr. Prabha Atre were interrupted due to time restrictions , angering audiences .
Many have also criticized the ASPM for inviting fewer musicians of less popularity to perform .
The ASPM has also been criticized for not publicly releasing vintage recordings of past festival performances .
After Pt .
Bhimsen Joshis death in January 2011 , the Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal decided to rename the festival Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav in honor of the legendary vocalist .
The Sawai Gandharva Music Festival is conducted every year in the first two weeks of December over three days .
In the past , the festival runs through whole the night and the days used to end in the morning .
Later on , when Pune Municipal Corporation set rule to finish the program before 10pm which leads to change in the schedule of the program .
Traditionally , each festival is inaugurated with a tribute honoring Pt .
Sawai Gandharva , with a Shehnai musician performing first , in the early morning .
During the first two days , programs begin in the late-afternoon and are supposed to officially end by 10 p.m. On the third and final day , the programme is conducted in two sessions , the first beginning in the early morning continuing until the early afternoon , the second session begins in the early evening and ends at 10 p.m. .
It has been tradition that the last , finale performance is presented by Pt .
Bhimsen Joshi .
Since Pt .
Joshis retirement in 2004 , other members of the Kirana Gharana have concluded the festival , including Pt .
Sangmeshwar Gurav in 2005 , leading disciples of Pt .
Bhimsen Joshi in 2006 .
Doyen of Kirana Gharana , eminent vocalist Dr. Prabha Atre has concluded every festival since 2007 .
 The festival officially concludes with the entire audience and remaining performers listening to the Thumri in Raag Bhairavi recording Jamuna Ke Teer by Sawai Gandharva , a tune made famous by and signature of the Thumri guru , Utd .

 Annasaheb Kirloskar wrote shakuntal in 1880 which was based on Kalidass , thereby starting a new tradition of sangita natak in Maharashtra .
 During 1880 which was based on Kalidass early period , Sangeet natak was dominated by religious plays like Sangeet Saubhdra , which is legend in Marathi sangeet natak .
 The trend changed with coming of sangeet Manapman , which depicts bravery of sangeet Manapman hero Dheryadhar and Sangeet Natak love with Bhamini which was written by Krushnaji Prabhakar Khadilkar .

Mogubai Kurdikar was a renowned Hindustani classical music vocalist of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana .
Mogu Kurdikar was born in a Gomantak Maratha Samaj community in the village of Kurdi in the then Portuguese Goa .
 When Mogu Kurdikar was ten years old , Mogu Kurdikar mother , Jayashreebai , took Mogu Kurdikar to the temple at Zambavli , and arranged for a wandering holyman to teach music to Mogu for a while .
 Later Mogu Kurdikar took Mogu for a while to a traveling theater company , the Chandreshwar Bhootnath Sangeet Mandali , and the company took Mogu for a while in as an actress .
 While Mogu was with Chandreshwar Bhootnath Mandali , Mogu Kurdikar mother died .
 A legend says that on her deathbed the mother told Mogu for a while that Jayashreebai soul would not rest in peace until Mogu for a while became a famous singer .
 The theater company soon went bankrupt , and the rival Satarkar Stree Sangeet Mandali hired Mogu for a while .
 Mogu for a while played commendably the parts such as of Kinkini in the play , Punyaprabhav , and of the heroine Subhadra in the play with the same name , Subhadra .
 A conflict arose , however , between Mogu for a while and one of the senior women in the theater company , who then expelled Mogu for a while from the company .
 Mogu for a while moved to Sangli , and took some music lessons from Inayat Khan of the Rampur-Sahaswan gharana .
 For some reason , however , he too soon decided to terminate giving Mogu for a while further lessons .
 At this time , vocalist legend Gaansamrat Alladiya Khan Saheb was in Sangli for medical treatment , and on his way to and from his doctors , he walked by Mogu for a while residence , where he would hear Mogu for a while practice what Mogu for a while had learnt from Inayat Khan .
 One day he stopped , introduced himself and offered to teach Mogu for a while .
 Young Mogu of course agreed , but despite Alladiyas fame , Alladiyas had not heard of Young Mogu of course - Alladiyas fame was not until some time later , when Alladiyas observed dignitaries bow down to Young Mogu of course , that Alladiyas fully realised Young Mogu of course standing .
After some eighteen months , Alladiya Khan moved to Bombay , and Mogu followed .
Thus begun a time of intrigue in Bombays high-society and classical music circles .
 For Alladiya was supported in Bombay by wealthy patrons in exchange for music teaching , and they would not let him take other students .
 In desperation , Mogu turned to Bashir Khan of the Agra gharana , who agreed to teach Bombays high-society if Bombays high-society would perform the formal gandha-bandan ceremony of guru-shishya discipleship with fellow Agra ustad Vilayat Hussein Khan .
 This came to happen , and Alladiya heard of This .
 He demanded that Bombays high-society stop the discipleship and instead go to his brother , Hyder Khan .
 But as the Agra ustads had a lot of clout , Mogu for a while hesitated , and solicited a promise that Alladiya would teach Mogu for a while himself in the future if Hyder ever failed to do so .
 A deal was worked out , Hyder taught Mogu for a while for a while , but Alladiyas rich and powerful students were putting a lot of pressure on Hyder to put a stop to it , increasingly jealous of Alladiyas progress .
 About 1930 , Alladiya felt forced to persuade his brother to stop teaching and leave town , but came clean to the heartbroken Mogu about what had happened , essentially breaking Hyder Khan promise .
 At this stage in her career , Mogu for a while could likely have supported herself as a performer .
But she chose not to .
Not content with the prospect of being just another name on the scene , she wanted to become the best , the foremost representative of a tradition .
She gave birth to a daughter , Kishori , and kept practicing on her own , until one day Alladiya came back to her .
They performed the gandha-bandan , and he now kept teaching her to the end of his life .
She became one of the topmost singers in North India , even hailed as the queen by Alladiya in public .
She received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1968 and the Sangeet Research Academy Award in 1980 , and was decorated with the Padma Bhushan , Indias third highest civilian honour for service to the nation , in 1974 .
 Mogu for a while trained students such as Kaushalya Manjeshwar , Padma Talwalkar , Kamal Tambe , Wamanrao Deshpande , Suhasini Mulgaonkar , Babanrao Haldankar , Arun Dravid , and Mogu for a while own daughter , Kishori Amonkar Some of Mogubais recordings have been reissued as a volume of RPG Musics Vintage 78 RPM Recordings on CD series .
This was at a time when it was difficult for classical musicians , in however high esteem , to support themselves .
The subcontinents many royal courts had supported the music for centuries , but there was no large middle class and no widespread public appreciation ; now the courts were on the remove , and the budding recording industry did not have anything like todays large commercial base

In Hindustani music , a pakad is a generally-accepted musical phrase thought to encapsulate the essence of a particular raga .
The pakad contains the melodic theme of the raga , on listening to the pakad a person who knows the raga is usually able to identify it .
In many cases , the ragas contain the same swaras , then the pakad also contains information about gayaki or chalan .
Usually , the pakad is formed from short convolutions of the arohana and avarohana , while in some cases it is quite different from them .
 The pakad for a particular raga need not be unique , The pakad for a particular raga sole purpose is to clarify what raga The pakad for a particular raga is .
For example , here is a pakad for raga Yaman , a prominent raga from Hindustani Music :
 While the sitar had earlier been used in jazz and Indian film music , a classical Indian stringed instrument was from the 1960s onwards that various pop artists in the Western world began to experiment with incorporating the sitar , a classical Indian stringed instrument , within various pop artists in the Western world compositions .
 The first known use of the sitar in a rock music recording session was made by the Yardbirds when various pop artists in the Western world hired a sitar player to play the main riff for various pop artists in the Western world single Heart Full of Soul .
However , the version with the sitar riff was not released at the time and George Harrison is now recognised as having introduced the instrument to pop music .
During a break in the filming of The Beatles second movie , Help !
 , George Harrison picked up a sitar left on the set as a prop and attempted to play it .
 George Harrison initial interest eventually led to George Harrison taking lessons from Pandit Ravi Shankar and Shambhu Das .
 George Harrison subsequently played the instrument on the Beatles song Norwegian Wood on the LP Rubber Soul in 1965 , which became the first released Western pop song to feature the sitar .
George Harrison went on to play the tamboura , a long-necked plucked lute , on both Revolver and Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band , as well as laying down sitar tracks for both albums on the songs Love You To , Tomorrow Never Knows , and Within You Without You .
A later Beatles song , Across the Universe , also featured the sitar .
 Additionally , George Harrison made great use of the sitar on George Harrison first solo album , 1968s Wonderwall Music .
 In early 1966 , Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones played the sitar on Paint It , Black , having taught Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones to play after visiting Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones friend George Harrison .

 In early October 1967 , Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones again played sitar on My Little One in a recording session with Jimi Hendrix as well as the tambura on Street Fighting Man .
A fad for sitars in pop songs soon developed , facilitated by the Danelectro Companys 1967 introduction of the first electric sitar , known as the Coral Electric Sitar .
This instrument was an electric guitar with a distinctive sitar-like sound , rather than an acoustic sitar of the type traditionally made in India .
Despite producing similar sounds , the two instruments are completely different .
As the electric sitar was much easier to play than the traditional version it quickly became the preferred choice of most rock musicians .
The Coral instrument was an inexpensive item for its time and production only continued for a few years , making them relatively rare and expensive instruments today .
 The late 1960s saw the release of songs featuring the sitar that included The Monkees This Just Doesnt Seem To Be My Day , Ricky Nelson s Marshmallow Skies , Scott McKenzie s San Francisco , The Cyrkle s Turn-Down Day , The Cowsills The Rain , the Park , and Other Things , John Fred and John Fred Playboy Bands Judy in Disguise , The Turtles Sound Asleep , The Chocolate Watch Band s In the Past , The Box Tops Cry Like a Baby , The Lemon Pipers Green Tambourine , Traffic s Paper Sun and Hole In My Shoe Tomorrow Real Life Permanent Dream , July The Way and The Kinks Fancy .
Elvis Presley had several recordings that prominently featured the electric sitar .
 These included a 1967 cover of Tommy Tucker s R&B ; classic Hi-Heel Hi-Heel Sneakers , Mort Shuman s Youll Think Of My , , Percy Mayfield s Stranger In My Own Home Town and a cover of the Anne Murray country classic , Snowbird .
 In the instances of Hi-Heel Sneakers and Snowbird , Nashville , Tennessee session musician Harold Bradley played the electric sitar .
 For Youll Think Of My and Stranger In My Own Home Town In My Own Home Town , highly regarded Memphis , Tennessee and Nashville , Tennessee session musician Reggie Young played the electric sitar .
 The Mamas & The Papas used the sitar on various tracks such as People Like Us , Snowqueen Of Texas , Lady Genevieve , My Wan na Be a Star and Grasshopper , and Sergio Mendes & Brazil 66 used it on `` Chove Chuva '' .
Eric Burdon and the Animals played the instrument in the songs Winds of Change , No Self Pity , Orange and Red Beams , All Is One , We Love You Lil , and Monterey .
The Strawberry Alarm Clock use the sitar in songs such as An Angry Young Man , Black Butter-Present and Sit with the Guru .
Although often overlooked , some of the most extensive users of the instrument in contemporary music were Mike Heron and Robin Williamson of The Incredible String Band , combining folk , psychedelia with eastern influences in the songs The Song Has no ending parts 1-9 , The Mad Hatters Song and The Iron Stone .
Steve Miller Band used sitar in their popular song Wild Mountain Honey .
Art-Rock bands such as The Moody Blues used the sitar on a few albums and particularly on In Search of the Lost Chord while the The Pretty Things album S.F. Sorrow also featured the instrument on a few tracks , as did Procol Harum s epic song In Held Twas In I on the segment Glimpses of Nirvana .
Jethro Tull used the sitar on Fat Man and Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day .
 The Strawbs used The Strawbs on many recordings while Genesis used the electric sitar on Fat Man and Skating song My Know What My Like from Fat Man and Skating fifth album Selling England by the Pound .
 Steve Howe of Yes used an electric sitar on the bands album Close to the Edge , and the band Family used the instrument in the song Face In The Cloud , recorded on Fat Man and Skating 1969 album Family Entertainment .
Donovan s hit song Hurdy Gurdy Man used a tamboura , which can also be heard on songs such as Sunny South Kensington , Breezes of Patchouli , Celeste , Guinevere , Three King Fishers , Ferris Wheel , and Fat Angel .
 Richie Havens made extensive use of the sitar in the title song of Richie Havens second album , Something Else Again .
Blue Cheer used both sitar and tabla in their song , Babji .
Although the sitar craze had died down by 1970 , its distinctive sound had become an indelible part of pop music .
 Tom Petty and Mike Campbell used a guitar fitted with a harpsichord-device to simulate a sitar for Tom Petty and Mike Campbell hit Dont Come Around Here No More while John Renbourn used the instrument prominently during John Renbourn time with the folk band Pentangle , on songs such as Once My Had a Sweetheart , House Carpenter , Cruel Sister , Rain And Snow and The Snows .
Roy Wood from The Move played sitar on Night of Fear using the same riffs as Tchaikovsky s 1812 Overture , as well as the electric sitar on Open up said the world at the door .
 Moreover , the Dutch band Shocking Blue used the sitar in many of The songs , most prominently in Love Buzz , Acka Raga , Water Boy , Hot Sand , and Im A Woman .

Ashwin Kumar Batish Hindi : ashvin kumaar baatish is a sitar and tabla player best known for rekindling interest in the sitar among young Indians .
 A child prodigy , young Ashwin would often sing with young Ashwin sister Meena Batish at performances organized by young Ashwin father , the composer , author , Bollywood playback singer and music director , Pandit Shiv Dayal Batish .
 young Ashwin mother , Shrimati Shanta Devi Batish , was an All India Radio artist and is credited for starting young Ashwin on the dholak drum around the age of seven and on the sitar around the age of 12 .
 When Ashwins father took Ashwins to see Ashwins friend Ashok , the son of the great music director and harmonium wizard Pandit Bhagatram , Ashwin fell in love with the sitar .
 Ashok was only 2 years older than young Ashwin and seeing Ashok friend perform made young Ashwin think that young Ashwin could too .
 In 1964 , Ashwins father left India to visit one of his daughters in England .
 young Ashwin turned to young Ashwin mother and shared with Shrimati Shanta Devi Batish young Ashwin secret wish to play the sitar .
 Shrimati Shanta Devi Batish bought young Ashwin a student model sitar and started teaching young Ashwin Shrimati Shanta Devi Batish , as Shrimati Shanta Devi Batish had played the sitar when young .
 young Ashwin mother had also presented young Ashwin with some sitar albums by Ravi Shankar .
 young Ashwin would listen and copy all the songs to the best of young Ashwin abilities .
 At the same time , young Ashwin was also a great fan of the Beatles , Cliff Richards , Pat Boone and other pop singers of the 50s era .

 young Ashwin was put on a rigorous practice schedule .
 The cold English weather meant that there was only one warm room in the house where all young Ashwin family would gather .
 To Ashwins advantage and delight , Ashwins father would always give Ashwins playing the preference to the dismay of Ashwins brothers and sisters .
 While Ashwins siblings strained to enjoy the British movies and serials on the TV , young Ashwin started to show improvement in Ashwins playing .
 On one such day , young Ashwin was practicing .
 When young Ashwin stopped playing , there was silence in the room .
 All young Ashwin family members were looking at young Ashwin and young Ashwin saw young Ashwin siblings nodding and showing appreciation at what young Ashwin had just played .
 young Ashwin learnt from this experience and started to tune into this new sense of expressive musical attraction .
 young Ashwin fine-tuned this ability in young Ashwin live performances .
 At 20 , young Ashwin found young Ashwin working full-time for a group of Chartered Accountants as an apprentice popularly known as an articled clerk .
 When young Ashwin turned up at the job in long hair and jeans , young Ashwin was promptly pulled aside by young Ashwin employers and given a lecture on attire .
 While Ashwin ignored these admonishments from young Ashwin bosses and fellow clerks , despite threats of being given menial tasks if young Ashwin did not comply , young Ashwin was finding that being part of the workforce was in complete contrast to young Ashwin lifestyle as a performer .

 young Ashwin 80s fling with fusion music young Ashwin self-titled Sitar Power was instrumental in garnering young Ashwin serious airplay including a recording contract with Shanachie Records of New Jersey .
 young Ashwin did not last long at Shanachie Records of New Jersey due to disappointing sales reports and lack of support .
 young Ashwin soon formed young Ashwin own record label , Batish Records to publish all young Ashwin familys works .
 young Ashwin continues to be active in the field of Indian music and is currently teaching at the Batish Institute of Indian Music and Fine Arts in Santa Cruz , California , USA .

Radhika Mohan Maitra was an Indian sarod player .
 Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra was considered an influential figure in 20th century sarod playing and received the title Sangeetacharya .
 Radhika Mohan Maitra was born 1917 in Calcutta to a prominent family of the erstwhile feudal aristocracy of East Bengal , and grew up in Rajshahi , where Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra family had vast estates .
 Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra grandfather Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra was a pakhawaj player and had in his employ , the renowned sarod player Mohammad Amir Khan , with whom Radhika Mohan studied for five to six years .
 According to Maitras private accounts given to his student Kalyan Mukherjea , this training initially adhered to a basic corpus of about 20 ragas for the first four years , but as the Ustad began to realize that his student Kalyan Mukherjea time was running out , his student Kalyan Mukherjea taught Radhika Mohan as many as three to four ragas in a day , in sessions lasting all day .
Radhubabu later studied dhrupad with the famous beenkar Dabir Khan and sitar with Enayat Khan .
 Maitras debut concert was in Calcutta , in the home of another aristocratic family , the Gangulys , who were also patrons of music .
Two of the Ganguly brothers , Shyam and Hirendra Kumar became renowned sarod and tabla players , respectively .
 This was followed by an appearance at the Allahabad Music Conference in 1937 , where Ganguly won the first prize in the instrumental music contest and was invited to perform alongside stalwarts such as Hafiz Ali Khan and Allauddin Khan .
 This was at this same conference that Ganguly gave a duet concert with Allauddin Khan at the latters invitation .
 Ganguly rose to great heights as a performer and from about 1940 until the mid-60s , no major musical event in India was complete without Ganguly participation .
 Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra was a prolific composer and perhaps the only keen student of sarod technique in Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra era .
 Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra not only archived hundreds of traditional compositions in voluminous ledgers that Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra maintained , but also devised a very efficient method of imparting sarod technique , repertoire and what Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra considered good musical taste , to Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra students .
 Radhubabu was considered a formidable authority on the theoretical aspects of raga music , which Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra took great pains to translate accurately into Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra own music and that of Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra students .
 After 1970 , Maitras technical form , which Maitras technical form was so renowned for , began to decline steeply , as Maitras technical form was struck by one personal tragedy after another .
 In 1976 , Maitras technical form announced Maitras technical form retirement from the concert stage and returned to perform only twice after , once in 1980 and then in 1981 .
 In October 1981 , Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra died of brain hemorrhage as a result of an accident in Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra south Calcutta home .
As a teacher , Radhika Mohan Maitra had very few equals .
Some of his students include sitarist Nikhil Banerjee , sarod players Buddhadev Dasgupta , Nemai Chand Dhar , Anil Roychowdhury , Samarendranath Sikdar , Kalyan Mukherjea , Narendranath Dhar , Joydeep Ghosh , sitarists Himadri Bhushan Bagchi , Sanjoy Bandopadhyay and Sugato Nag .
Of his students , Kalyan Mukherjea and Samarendra Sikdar are the closest to his personal sound and style .
Radhubabu was temperamentally and culturally unlike the professional musicians of his time .
 He belonged to the erstwhile patron class and had organized and financed many large-scale music conferences , and even when , after the partition of India in 1947 , he had to leave his ancestral lands in Rajshahi and come to Calcutta , was not able abandon his aristocratic temperament in favour of the professional mindset .
As a result , he was never a commercially successful musician .
 Radhika Mohan Maitra was also exceptionally well-educated for an Indian musician of Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra era .
 Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra had a masters degree in Philosophy , and trained as a lawyer .
 In fact , Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra took to law as Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra profession , and was a failure in this endeavour , before allowing music to become Raybahadur Lalita Mohan Maitra livelihood

The rudra veena is a large plucked string instrument used in Hindustani classical music , one of the major types of veena played in Indian classical music .
It has a long tubular body made of wood or bamboo with a length between 54 and 62 inches .
Two large-sized , round resonators , made of dried and hollowed gourds , are attached under the tube .
Twenty-four brass-fitted raised wooden frets are fixed on the tube with the help of wax .
There are 4 main strings and 3 chikari strings .
As Rudra is a name for the Hindu god Shiva , rudra vina literally means the veena dear to Shiva .
It is an ancient instrument rarely played today .
The rudra veena declined in popularity in part due to the introduction in the early 19th century of the surbahar , which allowed sitarists to more easily present the alap sections of slow dhrupad - style ragas .
In 20th century , Zia Mohiuddin Dagar modified and redesigned the rudra veena to use bigger gourds , a thicker tube , thicker steel playing strings and closed javari that .
This produced a soft and deep sound when plucked without the use of any plectrum .
The instrument was further modified as the shruti veena by Lalmani Misra to establish Bharats Shadja Gram and obtain the 22 shrutis

 the Arohana , the Arohana or the Arohana , in the context of Indian classical music , is the ascending scale of notes in a raga .
The pitch increases as we go up from Shadja to the Taar Shadja , possibly in a crooked manner .
In Hindustani classical music , the ascending scales notes are S R G M P D and N. Lower forms of notes are written in lower case , like r g m d n , while the first scale given above is that of higher form of the notes .
The English notes C D E F G A and B correspond to S R G M P D and N , when C is taken as the tonal note .
In Carnatic music , the ascending scales notes for the variant notes R G M D and N have a subscript number indicating the specific variant .
 In Sankarabharanam ragam the Arohana is S R2 G3 M1 P D2 N3 S. See swaras in Carnatic music for explanation of notation .
In Abhogi ragam , which is a janya ragam of 22nd melakarta Kharaharapriya , the Arohana is S R2 G1 M1 D2 S .
In this ragam certain notes are excluded so the raga is totally changed
Syahi is the tuning paste applied to the head of many South Asian percussion instruments like the dholki , tabla , madal , mridangam , khol and pakhavaj .
 Syahi is usually black in colour , circular in shape and is made of a mixture of flour , water and iron filings .
Originally , syahi was a temporary application of flour and water .
Over time it has evolved into a permanent addition .
Syahi functions by loading only a portion of the stretched skin with weight .
In the higher-pitched drum this has the effect of altering the resonance frequency of some lower order vibrations more than others .
The action on the left hand drum is a little different .
 On other side , The action on the left hand drum position is offset and serves simply to lower the resonance frequency .
The application of the syahi is very involved .
 The application of the syahi starts with a base layer of mucilage , followed by the application of numerous thin layers of syahi masala , which are then rubbed with a stone .
Not all of the layers are the same size .
But the final product is expected to exhibit a specific shape .
The stone abrasion is crucial to creating the syahi .
The material from which the syahi is made is inherently inflexible ; if it were simply applied in a single layer and allowed to harden , it would not allow the drum to vibrate freely .
The process of rubbing or polishing with the stone creates a tight latticework of cracks which extend down to the very base of the syahi , allowing vibrations to travel across the whole object , despite the toughness of the syahis raw material .
The process from the application of the first layer of glue and the finesse in adding the subsequent layers of syahi is the main determinant in the resulting tonal purity of the instrument and also of the longevity of the layers .
Once the preliminary leatherskin Puri is fastened onto the face of the tabla , the craftsman applies the glue in a circle on the surface leaving a half-inch margin from the Chati .
When the glue is about to set , the syahi is applied in a 2-3 mm thick layer over the glue with small spikes in the syahi layer .
Once the syahi is semi-hardened and not yet dry , the rubbing with the stone begins .
The rubbing continues till it removes the spikes and a coarse surface results .
On this , layers are then added in reducing concentric circles , each half to one mm thick .
The essence lies in beginning the rubbing before the syahi completely hardens and continuing it till the surface is nearly dry when the new layer is added .
The rubbing and its proper technique ensures that the layers are each uniformly thick , tapering slightly at the edges to smoothly merge in the layer below .
The process of rubbing generates heat in the paste applied and achieves the function of drying the paste and also the frictional vibration of the surface with the stone results in a fine latticework of cracks leaving grains of syahi attached only to the base of the layer below .
 This structure gives the instrument This structure exceptional sonority and tonal quality among all percussion instruments and also the rich harmonics which range from This structure tuned pitch of a few hundred Hertz to a few KiloHertz .
 If the syahi is allowed to harden without rubbing Syahi continuously , pockets of solidity would be left in the layers and distort the tone and also result in breakage of the grains from the layers within a short span , resulting in a jarring rattling sound during playing .
The layers , as the leatherskin on which they are applied , are vulnerable to humidity in the weather and also the moisture in the players hand .
Interaction with moisture results in melting of the black crystals .
This is the reason why players frequently use powder to keep the hands dry while playing
Mian Ghulam Nabi Shori popularly known as Shori Mian was an Indian composer of Hindustani classical music .

Pannalal Ghosh , also known as Amal Jyoti Ghosh , was a Bengali Indian flute player and composer .
 Amal Jyoti Ghosh was a disciple of Allauddin Khan , and is credited with giving the flute its status in Hindustani classical music .
 Amal Jyoti Ghosh was born on 24 July 1911 in Barisal , East Bengal in British India .
 Amal Jyoti Ghosh was named Amal Jyoti Ghosh with Pannalal having been Amal Jyoti Ghosh nickname .
 Amal Jyoti Ghosh father , Akshay Kumar Ghosh , was a sitarist .
 Amal Jyoti Ghosh received Amal Jyoti Ghosh initial training in music from Amal Jyoti Ghosh father , learning to play the sitar .
 Two apocryphal incidents in Amal Jyoti Ghosh childhood are believed to have influenced Amal Jyoti Ghosh in taking up the flute .
As a child he had picked up a small flute that cowherds usually played , and on the basis of the education he was receiving on the sitar from his father , he would try to play musical patterns on the flute .
The family 's ancestral house was on the banks of the Kirtankhola river .
 At the age of nine , while swimming in the river one day , Amal Jyoti Ghosh found a long bamboo stick that was half-flute and half walking stick .
 The flute part of the stick was longer than a traditional flute and Amal Jyoti Ghosh started practising on it .
 Then at the age of eleven , Amal Jyoti Ghosh is said to have met a holy man who held a conch and a flute and asked if Amal Jyoti Ghosh could play the flute .
 When Amal Jyoti Ghosh obliged , the man blessed Amal Jyoti Ghosh and said that music would be Amal Jyoti Ghosh salvation .
 Amal Jyoti Ghosh was married to Parul Ghosh in 1924 when Parul Ghosh in 1924 was only nine and Amal Jyoti Ghosh was thirteen years old .
 Parul Ghosh in 1924 was the younger sister of Ghosh 's friend Anil Biswas who went on to become a celebrated music composer .
 Parul Ghosh in 1924 was a talented singer Parul Ghosh in 1924 and later became a well-known playback singer .
 In 1928 , Amal Jyoti Ghosh became a part of the Indian Independence Movement .
 Amal Jyoti Ghosh joined a gymnasium and learnt martial arts , boxing and stick fighting .
 As Amal Jyoti Ghosh became more involved in the independence movement , the government started keeping a close watch .
 Consequently Amal Jyoti Ghosh shifted to Calcutta at the age of seventeen in search of a livelihood .
 At the age of eighteen , Amal Jyoti Ghosh started focusing Amal Jyoti Ghosh attention on the flute .
 Amal Jyoti Ghosh realised that a bigger flutes pitch and sonority would be more appropriate for both classical and light music .
 Amal Jyoti Ghosh experimented with various materials including metal and different types of wood , and decided on using bamboo .
 Amal Jyoti Ghosh finally settled on a flute which was thirty two inches long .
Pannalal Ghosh jointly scoring the background for `` Aandhiyan '' in 1952 along with Ustad Ali Akbar Khan and Pandit Ravi Shankar .
He was the first to introduce the seven hole flute .
Authentic list of Pt .
 Pannalal Ghosh 's noteworthy students at Calcutta contained Haripada Choudhary , Aminur Rehman , Fakirchanda Samanta , Sudhanshu Choudhury , Mukul Roy and Gaur Goswami .

Desai , Ramaprasad Mukherjee , Mahesh Mastfakir , Sharad Maholay , Bhailal Barot , Suraj Narain Purohit and Hari Chabria
In the context of Indian classical music , Swara is a Sanskrit word that means a note in the octave .
 The seven basic swaras of the scale are named shadja , rishabh , gandhar , madhyam , pancham , dhaivat and nishad , and are shortened to Sa , Ri or Re , Ga , shuddha Ma , Pa , Dha , and Ni and written S , R , G , M , P , D , N. Collectively these notes are known as the sargam .
Sargam is the Indian equivalent to solfege , a technique for the teaching of sight-singing .
The tone Sa is not associated with any particular pitch .
As in Western moveable-Do solfege , Sa refers to the tonic of a piece or scale rather than to any particular pitch .
In the general sense svara means tone , and applies to chanting and singing .
The basic swaras of Vedic chanting are udatta , anudatta and svarita .
The musical octave is said to have evolved from the elaborate and elongated chants of Sama Veda , based on these basic swaras .
Siksha is the subject that deals with phonetics and pronunciation .
 Naradiya Siksha elaborately discusses the nature of The basic swaras of Vedic chanting , both Vedic chants and the octave .
A dot above a letter indicates that the note is sung one octave higher , and a dot below indicates one octave lower .
Or , if a note with the same name - Sa , for example - is an octave higher than the note represented by S , an apostrophe is placed to the right : S .
If it is an octave lower , the apostrophe is placed to the left : S. Apostrophes can be added as necessary to indicate the octave : for example , `` g would be the note komal Ga in the octave two octaves below that which begins on the note S .
 The basic mode of reference is that The basic mode of reference is equivalent to the Western Ionian mode or major scale .
All relationships between pitches follow from this .
In any seven-tone mode , R , G , D , and N can be natural or flat but never sharp , and the M can be natural or sharp but never flat , making twelve notes as in the Western chromatic scale .
If a swara is not natural , a line below a letter indicates that it is flat and an acute accent above indicates that it is sharp .
 Sa and Pa are immovable , forming a just perfect fifth .
In some notation systems , the distinction is made with capital and lowercase letters .
When abbreviating these tones , the form of the note which is relatively lower in pitch always uses a lowercase letter , while the form which is higher in pitch uses an uppercase letter .
 So komal Re/Ri uses the letter r and shuddha Re/Ri , the letter R , but shuddha Ma uses m because So komal Re/Ri has a raised form - tivra shuddha Ma - which uses the letter M. Sa and Pa are always abbreviated as S and P , respectively , since S , R , G , M , P , D can not be altered .
The swaras in Carnatic music are slightly different in the twelve-note system .
 There are three types each of Chatushruti Rishabha , Shuddha Gandhara , Dhaivata and Nishada .
There are two types of Madhyama , while Panchama and Shadja are invariant .
As you can see above , Chatushruti Rishabha and Shuddha Gandhara share the same pitch .
Hence if C is chosen as Shadja , D would be both Chatushruti Rishabha and Shuddha Gandhara .
 Hence Shadja will not occur in same raga together .
Similarly for two swaras each at notes 4 , 10 and 11 .
Each shuddha swara is traditionally held to have originated in the sound of a different animal , and some have additional meanings of their own .
Also , each swara is associated with one of the seven chakras of the body .
Just as the swaras ascend through the saptak , so they are mapped onto the chakras in the body in ascending order .
Komal notes are associated with the left side of each chakra ; the left channel , Ida Nadi , is the side of emotion and intuition .
Shuddha and tivra notes are associated with the right side ; the right channel , Pingala Nadi , is the side of logic .
 Ragas , therefore , have more or less of an effect on a given chakra depending on the notes Shuddha and tivra contain .
In certain forms of Indian classical music and qawwali , when a rapid 16th note sequence of the same note is sung , different syllables may be used in a certain sequence to make the whole easier to pronounce .
For example , instead of sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa-sa said very quickly , it might be sa-da-da-li-sa-da-da-li which lends itself more to a quick and light tongue movement .
In the context of Indian classical music some specific forms of swara-s fulfill the technique of playing a note .
Such ornamentations in Indian classical music is important for the proper rendition and essential to create the beauty of a raga .
Some notes are linked with their preceding or succeeding notes ; these linked notes are called grace notes or kan-swars .
Kan-swars deal with so called touch notes .
Kan-swars can be executed vocally and on instruments in three ways : .
Andolit swars are raga-specific notes that are oscillated within the Andolan alankar .
The specification of the Andolan alankar is the oscillation from a fixed note touching the periphery of an adjacent note .
By this oscillation the shrutis are touched which exist in between

Tana Mana is an album by Indian musician Ravi Shankar , originally credited to the Ravi Shankar Project and released in 1987 .
 The album is an experimental work by sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar , mixing traditional instrumentation with 1980s electronic music and sampling technology .
 sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar recorded much of Tana Mana in 1983 with sound effects innovator Frank Serafine , but much of Tana Mana in 1983 remained unreleased until Peter Baumann , head of new age record label Private Music , became attached to the project .
The album title translates to mean body and mind .
 In addition to sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar familiar instrument , the sitar , sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar plays synthesizer extensively on the recording .
The album also includes contributions from Lakshmi Shankar , Aashish Khan and Kumar Bose , and Western musicians such as George Harrison , Al Kooper and Ray Cooper .
 In sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar 1997 autobiography , Raga Mala , Ravi Shankar writes that Raga Mala started work on Tana Mana in 1983 at the home studio of Frank Serafine , a sound effects designer for Hollywood films such as Tron .
 The album began as an experiment by sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar with the innovative sampling technology that Serafine had assembled at his studio - Serafine FX in Venice , western Los Angeles .
 sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar recalls recording two or three pieces on synthesizer before having to depart for India .
 On sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar return to Los Angeles , sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar overdubbed contributions from regular accompanists such as sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar son Shubho and sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar , and from sarodya Aashish Khan and tabla player Swapan Chaudhuri .
Up to five new pieces were also recorded at this time , according to Shankars recollection .
 The experimental nature of the project impressed sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar circle of friends in California , sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar writes in Raga Mala , but confused record companies , who were unable to attribute the music to a recognised genre .
 The recordings were left sitting there waiting for someone to show more interest , sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar recalls , until the involvement of German composer Peter Baumann , who had formed a label specialising in experimental music , Private Music , in 1984 .
According to the credits listed in Shankars 1995 box set In Celebration , further recording for what became Tana Mana took place during 1986 .
One of the additional tracks was Friar Park , featuring Shankars friend and sometime collaborator George Harrison .
 Named after collaborator George Harrison estate in Oxfordshire , west of London , the song was based on Raga Charukeshi and features Shankar playing both standard and bass sitars .
 sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar and collaborator George Harrison taped the track at FPSHOT , collaborator George Harrison home studio , accompanied by Ray Cooper on marimba and Markandeya Mishra , a local tabla player .
 Another 1986 recording was West Eats Meat , Meat title suggested by Serafine as a pun on Shankars earlier cross-cultural projects , such as West Meets East , his trilogy of albums with classical violinist Yehudi Menuhin .
 sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar describes the session for West Eats Meat as the first time sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar ever played sitar with a jazz bassist - in this instance , Patrick OHearn .
 Produced by German composer Peter Baumann at The Enterprise in Burbank , California , the session included contributions from Lakshmi , sarodya Aashish Khan and former sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar student Harihar Rao , and tabla player Kumar Bose .
 Like tabla player Swapan Chaudhuri , tabla player Kumar Bose had become one of Shankars preferred accompanists on tabla , following the end of of the sitarists 33-year partnership with Alla Rakha in 1985 .
 Other Western musicians who contributed to the album include Al Kooper , on electric guitar , and Ric Parnell , playing electronic drums .
 In both his autobiography and the comments included with In Celebration , sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar refers to Tana Mana as having been an enjoyable album to make .
 The title track was one of my favourite numbers , he writes - a musical tribute to his mother , who died in 1936 while sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar was in Paris with sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar brother Uday s dance company .
 In his 1995 comments on Tana Mana , sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar writes : I lost I sweet mother at an early age , but I clearly remember her singing to I .
 I dedicate this song to her beautiful spirit .
The title translates to mean body and mind .
 Another track , Memory of sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar , is dedicated to Uday Shankar , who died in Calcutta in 1977 .
Private Music released Tana Mana in 1987 , with the album credited to the Ravi Shankar Project .
 sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar attributed its eventual release , four years after conception , to the advent of new-age music , a genre that German composer Peter Baumann record label did much to promote .
Inside the Kremlin and Passages , the latter a collaboration with American composer Philip Glass .
 Tana Mana , Friar Park and West Eats Meat later appeared on In Celebration , which collaborator George Harrison compiled to celebrate sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar 75th birthday .
Allmusic critic Adam Greenberg writes of Tana Mana : The reverberant quality of the sitar combines rather well with the chosen electronic accompaniments to form a set of coherent songs , unlike many other such attempted combinations of traditional instruments and technology .
 The sitar playing is , as usual , superb ... With an extra sarod thrown in , a small front line of synthesizers , and sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar friend George Harrison assisting on the autoharp , the pile of musicality that forms allows an unexpectedly coherent , clear , and relatively focused piece of music to emerge .
 In a 2010 article on sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar , music website Shakenstir described Tana Mana as having brought Mr. Shankar 's music into the New age with Mr. Shankar 's music unique method of combining traditional instruments with electronics .
 The article quoted a 2007 interview in which sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar defended sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar association with Western artists such as classical violinist Yehudi Menuhin , collaborator George Harrison , American composer Philip Glass and John Coltrane against criticism from Indian classical music purists : Yes , I performed with Yehudi Menuhin , composed 2 concertos experimented with jazz , far eastern music , Phillip Glass , ballet , orchestration film music , music theatre and so much more - from 1945 ... If you listen to I CD Tana Mana , I have worked with electronic music 25 years ago .
 But I did all this without compromising on the solid foundation of our classical music .
 If few musicians didnt understand I then it was their problem .
 I have no regrets

 Ustad Thirkawa musical training continued with a gusto till Ustad Thirkawa landed in the house of Agra dynastys major singer , Ustad Vilayat Husain Khan .
That was the most fortunate thing happening to this talented lad .
 They , teacher and student , clicked together and young Jagannath travail was duly rewarded .
 young Jagannath not only received excellent training from Vilayat Khan but young Jagannath admiration as well .
 young Jagannath was not only a fine vocalist but was an avid creator of Hindustani original themes , cheej .
 After independence , the royal patronage , the source of basic income vanished and young Jagannath moved in various cities to find income to support young Jagannath .
 young Jagannath was a celibate and had to fend for young Jagannath .
It was tough to say the least .
 young Jagannath managed somehow .
It requires a creativity to develop newer and fancier rendering of the traditional Ragas .
Not many can do such original renderings .
 Most just copy whatever their teachers teach Serving ones teachers and keep the style as dictated by the dynastic principles , gayaki .
 One of his disciple from Pune has said following about young Jagannath musical philosophy : .
Jagannath Buwa often told me that the basic requirement of music is that magical quality called `` Rang '' .
 As a quality in music , `` Rang '' transcends considerations of voice quality , grammar and communication of rasa .
 While in Mumbai , Rang was not only admired by many a musical lovers but by generous supporters .
 Two among them were V V Gokhale and Gokhale younger brother , Va Va Gokhale of Dadar .
 Gokhale was a regular performer at Dadar-Matunga Music Club .
 Gokhale died at Dombivli on a Diwali day in 1968 .
 Gokhale was cremated at Dadar .
 Gokhale was also known for Gokhale high social conscience .
 When Gokhale was donated a purse by Gokhale well-wishers in 1962 to help Gokhale monetarily during Gokhale final years , India was engaged in a war with China .
 After the war was over , Gokhale contributed generously to the Relief Fund for soldiers .
 Gokhale dismissed Gokhale disciples protests by saying that one should not shirk ones duty and should not try to avoid paying ones dues .
 A music festival named after Gokhale started by Gokhale disciple , C R Vyas in 1977 is held every year in Mumbai as well as many a major Indian cities .

Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee was an eminent Indian classical sitarist of the Maihar Gharana .
A student of the legendary Baba Allauddin Khan , Pandit Nikhil Banerjee was known for his technical virtuosity and clinical execution .
 Along with Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Vilayat Khan , Pandit Ravi Shankar emerged as one of the leading exponents of the Sitar and is regarded as a legend of Indian Classical music .
Nikhil Banerjee was born on October 14 , 1931 in Calcutta into a Brahmin family .
 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee father , Jitendranath Banerjee , was an amateur sitarist and Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee was fascinated by Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee fathers playing .
 Although Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee wanted to try Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee hand at an instrument as early as the age of four , Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee was discouraged by Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee father and grandfather .
 At the age of five , however , they relented and Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee acquired a small sitar , initially learning under Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee father .
 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee grew into a child prodigy .
 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee won an All-India sitar competition and became the youngest musician employed by All India Radio at the age of nine .
Jitendranath approached Mushtaq Ali Khan to take Nikhil as a disciple , but only learned from this master for a few short weeks .
 Instead Birendra Kishore Roy Chowdhury , the zamindar of Gouripur in present-day Bangladesh , became responsible for much of Birendra Kishore Roy Chowdhury early training .
 Around 1946 Nikhil Banerjee met the great khyal singer Amir Khan through the masters teaching of Nikhil Banerjees sister , and Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee enthusiasm for Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee music was reinforced by hearing Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee in concert a couple of years later .
Amir Khan continued to have a significant influence on Banerjees musical development .
 In 1947 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee met Ustad Allauddin Khan , who was to become Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee main guru along with his son , Ali Akbar Khan .
Both were sarod players .
 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee went to Allauddin Khans concerts and was desperate to have Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee as Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee teacher .
 Allauddin Khan did not want to take on more students , but changed his son Ali Akbar Khan mind after listening to one of Banerjees radio broadcasts .
 Allauddin Khan was his son Ali Akbar Khan main teacher , after his son Ali Akbar Khan left Maihar his son Ali Akbar Khan also learned from Ali Akbar Khan , the son of Allaudin Khan , for many years .
The discipline under Ustad Allauddin Khan was legendary .
For years , Nikhils practice would start at four in the morning and , with few breaks , continue to eleven oclock at night .
 Among others , Ustad Allauddin Khan also taught his son Ali Akbar Khan son Ali Akbar Khan , grandson Aashish Khan , and nephew Bahadur Khan on the sarod ; Ravi Shankar on the sitar ; his son Ali Akbar Khan daughter , Annapurna Devi , on the surbahar ; Pannalal Ghosh on the flute ; and Vasant Rai the sarod .
 Ustad Allauddin Khan was passing on not only playing technique but the musical knowledge and approach of the Maihar gharana ; yet there was a definite trend in his son Ali Akbar Khan teaching to infuse the sitar and sarod with the been-baj aesthetic of the Rudra veena , surbahar and sursringar -- long , elaborate alap built on intricate meend work .
 his son Ali Akbar Khan was also well known for adjusting his son Ali Akbar Khan teaching to his son Ali Akbar Khan particular students strengths and weaknesses .
 Consequently , under his son Ali Akbar Khan teaching , Pandit Ravi Shankar and Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee developed different sitar styles .
 After Maihar , Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee embarked on a concert career that was to take him to all corners of the world and last right up to his untimely death .
 All through his life he kept taking lessons from Ustad Allauddin Khan and his son Ali Akbar Khan children , Ustad Ali Akbar Khan and Smt .
Annapurna Devi .
 Perhaps reflecting Annapurna Devi . early upbringing , Annapurna Devi . always remained a humble musician , and was content with much less limelight than a player of Annapurna Devi . stature could have vied for .
 Even so , in 1968 , Annapurna Devi . was decorated with the Padma Shri , and in 1974 received the prestigious Sangeet Natak Akademi Award .
Nikhil Banerjee frequently toured Europe and the USA , with prominent tabla players including Swapan Chaudhuri and Anindo Chatterjee .
 Although Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee was often resident at the Ali Akbar College of Music in California Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee taught few pupils on a one-to-one basis , for Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee stated reason that Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee did not feel Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee had adequate time to devote to Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee students , as Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee was still learning and performing .
 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee hoped that developing a proper disciple relationship with students would become possible later in Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee life , but , sadly , Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee early demise meant it did not happen .
 Nevertheless , a number of prominent sitarists have been influenced by Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee teaching and distinctive style .
 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee recorded only a handful of recordings during Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee lifetime but a series of live performance recordings continue to be released posthumously making sure that Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee musical legacy is preserved for posterity .
 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee did not always enjoy recording within the confines of the studio , though Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee early studio recordings with EMI India such as Lalit , Purya Kalyan and Malkauns are now considered to be classic renditions of these ragas .
 The posthumous live albums , many of which were brought out around the turn of the 21st Century by Raga Records in New York , and Chhandadhara of Germany , are widely considered to be the finest documents of Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee playing .
 Many of Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee unpublished concert recordings are available which are testimony to his musical thought .
Nikhil Banerjee was in failing health through the 80s , having survived three heart attacks .
 On January 27 , 1986 , on the birthday of Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee younger daughter , at the relatively young age of 54 , Nikhil Banerjee died of a fourth heart attack .
 At the time of Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee death , Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee was a faculty member at the Ali Akbar College of Music in Calcutta .
 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee was posthumously awarded the Padma Bhushan title by the Government of India in the same year as Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee death .
 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee is survived by Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee wife Roma and two daughters .
 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee elder daughter is married into the Tagore family .
 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee younger daughter Debdutta/Arya is a model and actress in Kolkata .
 In an interview Nikhil as a disciple said Nikhil as a disciple had been influenced by Allauddin Khan , Ali Akbar Khan , Amir Khan , and to a lesser extent by Omkarnath Thakur , Faiyaz Khan , Kesarbai Kerkar , and Roshanara Begum .
 For Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee , music-making was a spiritual rather than a worldly path : .
 Nikhil Banerjee is revered for Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee mastery in both melodic and rhythmic aspects of Indian music .
 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee unique style of sitar playing is considered to have completeness , emotion and depth .
 Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee interpretation of ragas was usually traditional , although Nikhil Ranjan Banerjee is credited with creating at least two new ragas .
 According to The San Francisco Chronicle , his son Ali Akbar Khan .
technique is a phenomenon , faster than cheetahs , more secure than the dollar .
 Music in Calcutta And Musicians observed that his son Ali Akbar Khan improvisations always sound completely natural and spontaneous .
 In an obituary published after his son Ali Akbar Khan death , The New York Times wrote the extraordinary fluidity and assurance of his son Ali Akbar Khan rhythmic ideas and phrasing set a standard that would have left the more international stars of Indian music behind .
 Today , his son Ali Akbar Khan is commonly regarded as one of the greatest sitarists of the 20th century and is often spoken of as being on a level with the other two masters Ravi Shankar and Vilayat Khan .
The following is a summary of some recent CD issues .
A more comprehensive discography can be found in the external links .
Banerjees technique is a phenomenon , faster than cheetahs , more secure than the dollar .
 But he does not lean on Banerjees technique as most players do .
It is there , at the ready , a strength to be called on when needed .
It is his gentle playing that is so singular .
The ease of it , highlighted by atypical bits of literal reiteration create a kind of euphoric effect .
The result is remarkably individual .
One could spot a Banerjee performance on a radio broadcast or tape , a thing of great difficulty among Oriental musicians

 The Indian santoor player Shivkumar Sharma remembers of Khans performance of the raga Chaayanat : Khans was probably in 1955-56 , I was relaxing in I terrace in Jammu .
 In the stillness of the night I heard the notes of Raga Chaayanat on the sitar emanate from I neighbors radio .
 I immediately noticed that the tone of the sitar was completely different and the style of playing radically unique .
 I rushed to switch on I radio ... I was totally engrossed and was very curious to know who this maestro was .
 Of ragas such as Kirwani , Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan has been credited with bringing Carnatic ragas into the sitar repertoire : Kanakangi , Latangi , Kirwani , Karaharapriya , Manavati , Ganamurti , etc. but rendering them through a Hindustani sensibility and in the Jafferkhani style .
 Kirwani was the first Hindustani musician to collaborate with Carnatic music in a performance with renowned Veena player Emani Sankara Sastry .
 Kirwani early experimentation with polytonality in Indian classical instrumentation was achieved in Kirwani sitar quintet .
Khan has had a valuable involvement with Indian cinema .
 He has composed and played for epic films like Mughal-e-Azam , Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje , Goonj Uthi Shehnai , Kohinoor and has collaborated with noted music directors such as Vasant Desai , C. Ramachandra , Madan Mohan and Naushad who has said , he not only enriched film music , but his participation lent prestige to I songs .
In 1976 , Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan created the Halim Academy of Sitar in Mumbai , India .
His legacy is being carried on by his son Zunain Khan , an accomplished sitarist himself .
Narrated by violinist Yehudi Menuhin , Deben Bhattacharyas film Raga features a young virtuosic Halim Jaffer Khan playing raga Sindh Bhairavi

Haafiz Ali Khan was an Indian Sarod player .
 Haafiz Ali Khan was a tall figure in twentieth-century sarod music .
A fifth-generation descendant of the famous Bangash Gharana of sarod players , Haafiz Ali was known for the lyrical beauty of his music and the crystal-clear tone of his strokes .
 The occasional critic has , however , observed that Khans imagination was often closer to the semi-classical thumri idiom than the austere dhrupad style prevalent in Khans imagination times .
 Son and disciple of the Sarod superstar Nanneh Khan , Son grew up in a community of Sarod players , it is likely that Son studied with Son father and a number of his proximate disciples .
 Son later took lessons from Son cousin Abdulla Khan , nephew Mohammad Amir Khan , and finally the beenkar Wazir Khan of Rampur .
Ustad Wazir Khan was a direct descendant of the legendary Tansen , through the lineage of the latters daughter .
Notably , Allauddin Khan of Maihar was also a pupil of Wazir Khan in Rampur in the same period .
 Rampur in the same period said that Wazir Khan in Rampur in the same period later studied dhrupad and thumri with Ganeshilal Mishra and Bhaiya Ganpatrao , respectively .
 Khansahibs regal appearance and electrifying charisma made Wazir Khan in Rampur in the same period one of the most sought-after musicians of Wazir Khan in Rampur in the same period time , which was no mean achievement for an instrumentalist in an era largely dominated by vocal music .
 Old-timers who have seen Wazir Khan in Rampur in the same period in concert recall Wazir Khan in Rampur in the same period stage presence and musicianship with reverence and awe .
 While still a court musician in Gwalior , Haafiz Ali would undertake numerous trips to Bengal , where a court musician in Gwalior performed at all major music festivals , and taught a large number of disciples .
 Khans imagination music found generous patrons in two Bengali aristocrats , Raychand Boral and Manmatha Ghosh , both of whom studied with Khans imagination at various points .
 Apart from Khans imagination formidable command over traditional sarod compositions , dhrupad and thumri , Haafiz Ali Khan was particularly appreciated in the Viceregal firmament of colonial India for Khans imagination unique , stylized renditions of God Save The King on Khans imagination sarod .
 This tradition of performing sacred , religious and official state hymns on the sarod is kept alive by Khans imagination illustrious son , Ustad Amjad Ali Khan as well as grandsons Amaan and Ayaan .
Haafiz Ali Khan died in 1972 , at the age of 84 in New Delhi .

The alap is the opening section of a typical North Indian classical performance .
It is a form of melodic improvisation that introduces and develops a raga .
In dhrupad singing the alap is unmetered , improvised and unaccompanied , and started at a slow tempo .
Instead of wholly free improvisation , many musicians perform alap schematically , for example by way of vistar , where the notes of the raga are introduced one at a time , so that phrases never travel further than one note above or below what has been covered before .
In such cases , the first reach into a new octave can be a powerful event .
In instrumental music , when a steady pulse is introduced into the alap , it is called jor ; when the tempo has been greatly increased , or when the rhythmic element overtakes the melodic , it is called jhala .
The jor and jhala can be seen as separate sections of the performance , or as parts of the alap ; in the same way , jhala can be seen as a part of jor .
Several musicologists have proposed much more complicated classifications and descriptions of alap .
In the same way as traditional four-part compositions have a sthai , antara , sanchar and abhog , some treat alap with a four-part scheme using the same names .
 Bengali researcher Bimalakanto Raychoudhuri in Bengali Bharatiya Sangeetkosh suggests classification both by length and by performance style , and proceeds to list thirteen stages : .
Even though Raychoudhuri admits the 13th stage is wholly extinct today , as we see we are in jhala already at the fourth stage ; the sthai-to-abhog movement is all part of the first stage ; stages six and up are said to be for instrumentalists only .
Other authorities have forwarded other classifications .
For example , when alap is sung with lyrics or at least syllables , as in dhrupad , it is called sakshar as opposed to anakshar

Shankar Family & Friends is an album by Indian musician Ravi Shankar , recorded primarily in Los Angeles during the spring of 1973 , but not released until late 1974 .
 It was produced by Shankars friend George Harrison friend George Harrison and one of the first releases on the ex - Beatle s Dark Horse label .
Out of print for many years , and much sought after as a result , the album was remastered in 2010 and reissued as part of the Ravi Shankar-George Harrison box set Collaborations .
The title Shankar Family & Friends refers to the group-participation approach to the music , from Shankars sister-in-law Lakshmi and son Shubho to a host of friends from the Indian subcontinent , Europe and the United States .
In a deliberate blend of East-meets-West musical styles , other performers include Indian-music pioneers Alla Rakha , Ashish Khan , Shivkumar Sharma and Hariprasad Chaurasia , and Western musicians such as Tom Scott , Emil Richards , Billy Preston , Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner .
 The album features the the Harrison-arranged pop bhajan I Am Missing You and a jazz-funk instrumental , Dispute & Violence , the latter a part of an intended ballet , titled Dream , Nightmare & Dawn .
 Although Ravi Shankar-George Harrison had served as Ravi Shankars producer before - on the latters 1971 Bangladesh relief EP Joi Bangla ; the soundtrack for the Apple documentary film Raga ; and a more recent live album with Ali Akbar Khan , recorded in New York - this was the first occasion that the two had collaborated on a studio album .
 Ravi Shankar-George Harrison would later refer to these and other projects with Ravi Shankar as one of his little careers going on on the side , a series of rewarding collaborations that co-existed beside Ravi Shankar-George Harrison solo career .
 This time , although Shankar Family & Friends did begin life as an Apple Records project , the results would not be issued on the Beatles label , but on Harrisons own Dark Horse Dark Horse Records .
 The bulk of the recording took place in Los Angeles during April 1973 , shortly after Ravi Shankar-George Harrison had completed work on Ravi Shankar-George Harrison album Living in the Material World and that of Nicky Hopkins , recorded concurrently in London .
 Arriving in Los Angeles in March , Ravi Shankar-George Harrison first attended Sunset Sound Studios , where former bandmate Ringo Starr s sessions for former bandmate Ringo Starr were getting under way .
 former bandmate Ringo Starr , Billy Preston , bass player Voormann and Nicky Hopkins would all contribute to Shankar Family & Friends over the next couple of months .
 Sessions began at A&M ; Studios , Los Angeles , on 1 April 1973 and continued into May , with a break towards the end of the first month .
 In addition to former bandmate Ringo Starr , Preston et al. , as producer , Ravi Shankar-George Harrison invited Tom Scott , Emil Richards , Jim Keltner and David Bromberg along to participate .
 A jazz arranger and composer , Tom Scott had previously worked with Harihar Rao , a former student of Shankars friend George Harrison and now an ethnomusicologist at UCLA .
 These sessions marked the first time that Ravi Shankar-George Harrison and Tom Scott worked together , so beginning a loose partnership that would endure through much of the 1970s .
 For the Indian contingent , Ravi Shankar chose a cast of similarly illustrious names : Alla Rakha and Kamala Chakravarty , both of whom had supported Ravi Shankar at the Concert for Bangladesh ; Ashish Khan , Shivkumar Sharma and Hariprasad Chaurasia , on sarod , santoor and bamboo flute , respectively , who had all taken part in Harrisons 1968 sessions for the Wonderwall soundtrack album ; and Lakshmi Shankar , L. Subramaniam and Harihar Rao , all of whom likewise went on to feature in the Music Festival from India venture the following year .
 While the majority of the recording was completed during that spring at A&M ; Studios ; , further sessions appear to have been required through to early 1974 , at Harrisons Friar Park studio .
Due to the delay in establishing a worldwide distributor for Dark Horse Records , Shankar Family & Friends was not issued for well over a year , until the autumn of 1974 .
It was numbered Dark Horse 22002 , being the new labels second release , after Splinter s The Place I Love .
Promotion for both albums included full-page advertisements in music publications such as Billboard , with Shankars release carrying the tagline : Only one artist in the world performed at the three most significant musical events of all time : Monterey Pop , Woodstock , and The Concert for Bangla Desh .
Dark Horse Records is proud to present his new music .
 Despite the originality and quality of musicianship on Shankar Family & Friends , musicianship on Shankar Family & Friends only reached number 176 in America and failed to register at all on Britains album chart , then just a top 50 .
 According to pop-culture author Robert Rodriguez , Ravi Shankar was in two minds about the albums fusion of Indian music and Western styles , remaining sensitive to charges that Robert Rodriguez was abandoning Robert Rodriguez classical roots for the rewards of superstardom .
 Ravi Shankar-George Harrison was proud of the result , and would later name Shankar Family & Friends and its more traditional follow-up , Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India , as two of the best releases on Ravi Shankar-George Harrison short-lived record label .
 The album cover consists of a group photograph taken at A&M ; Studios ; Studios that highlights the albums East-meets-West theme .
 Ravi Shankar sports a baritone saxophone , Ravi Shankar-George Harrison sits behind a small drum , while most of the other musicians have swapped their regular instrument for the opposite cultures near equivalent : Jim Keltner plays another hand drum , whereas Alla Rakha holds a pair of drumsticks ; bass player Voormann has a tamboura , Sharma a Western-style violin , and Chaurasia a bass flute .
 Side one of the original LP begins with the the Harrison-arranged , Spector - esque I Am Missing You , a toe-tapping pop song about which Ravi Shankar would later recall : I dont know how I did Side one of the original LP , but one day I wrote an English song without thinking ... Ravi Shankar-George Harrison heard Side one of the original LP and liked Side one of the original LP so much Ravi Shankar-George Harrison wanted to do a version of Ravi Shankar-George Harrison own .
 Released as a single , I Am Missing You features Lakshmi Shankar on vocals backed by a full Western rock band - Ravi Shankar-George Harrison , Nicky Hopkins , Tom Scott , bass player Voormann , Jim Keltner , Billy Preston and others - and a soaring , almost Ronette - like arrangement similar to those Harrison bestowed on Billy Preston own Dont Let Me Wait Too Long and Starrs Photograph around this time .
 The opening track is followed by four further Krishna bhajans , including a reprise of I Am Missing You , and concluding with a gospel - inspired reading of the traditional folk song Jaya Jagadish Hare .
 Side two was written as a proposed ballet entitled Dream , Nightmare & Dawn , made up of what Harrison biographer Simon Leng biographer Simon Leng describes as adventurous ensemble compositions , improvised on the spot in two days .
 Ravi Shankar concedes that such an approach was a strange way of doing things , not to mention expensive .
Surprisingly , the ballet does not appear to have ever been performed in its entirety .
 The result across the fourteen tracks is a blend of traditional Indian music , jazz , funk , rock and Western pop - in Shankars words , The album contains almost every possible style that you can think of .
The best-known songs are the single and Dispute & Violence , on which Emil Richards and Tom Scott star .
 Both these tracks were performed on the 1974 North American tour undertaken by Harrison biographer Simon Leng and Ravi Shankar , when Harrison biographer Simon Leng would introduce I Am Missing You as a love song to Krishna .
Footage of a live version of Dispute & Violence from the tour was included as a bonus feature on the DVD release of Martin Scorsese s 2011 documentary

Justin Hayward is an English musician , best known as singer , songwriter and guitarist in the rock band The Moody Blues .
 Justin Hayward was born in Dean Street , Swindon , Wiltshire , England and educated at Shrivenham School , Berkshire and The Commonweal School , in Swindon .
 When Justin Hayward was 15 Justin Hayward was able to afford a his Gibson guitar and a Vox amplifier through performing with local Swindon groups in clubs and dance halls playing mostly Buddy Holly songs .
One of Haywards early groups was All Things Bright , which opened for The Hollies and Brian Poole and the Tremeloes .
 At age 17 , Brian Poole signed a publishing contract as a songwriter with the skiffle artist and record producer Lonnie Donegan , a move Hayward later regretted as it meant the rights to all Brian Poole songs written before 1974 would always be owned by Donegans Tyler Music .
 In 1965 Brian Poole answered an advertisement in Melody Maker and auditioned as guitarist for Marty Wilde and Brian Poole went on to work with Marty Wilde and Brian Poole wife in The Wilde Three .
 In 1966 , after answering another ad in Melody Maker , this time placed by Eric Burdon of The Animals , Justin Hayward was contacted by Mike Pinder of The Moody Blues after Eric Burdon of The Animals had passed on Haywards letter and demo discs to Mike Pinder of The Moody Blues .
 Within a few days Justin Hayward had replaced departing Moody Blues vocalist and guitarist Denny Laine .
Bassist John Lodge replaced temporary deputy Rod Clarke who had stood in for departed Bassist Clint Warwick at the same time .
 After beginning by singing the old blues-inspired repertoire of The Moodies 1964-1965 era , Haywards initial artistic contribution to The Moody Blues was his song Fly US High , which was a Decca single early in 1967 .
It failed to chart but gave the revised band a new direction forward from the R & B sound they had been largely producing up to that point .
 Haywards driving rocker Leave This Man Alone was then used as B side to the next Moodies single on a Decca single , backing Mike Pinders Love And Beauty the first the next Moodies single on Decca record to feature the mellotron .
 Haywards and Lodges integration into the Moody Blues along with Pinders use of the Mellotron sparked greater commercial success and recognition for the band , transforming Haywards into one of pop musics biggest-selling acts .
 Justin Hayward says of Mike Pinder of The Moody Blues : Mike Pinder of The Moody Blues and the Mellotron made US songs work .
The 1967 album Days of Future Passed , one of the first and most influential symphonic rock albums , spawned the Hayward-penned singles Tuesday Afternoon and Nights in White Satin .
 The latter record went on to sell over two million copies , charting Three times in the UK and has been recorded by many other recording artists .
Haywards B side song Cities being an early ecology themed item .
 Justin Hayward became the groups main onstage figurehead over the 1967-1974 period , and the most prolific songwriter and composer of several big hit singles for the band .
 During this time Justin Hayward wrote memorable album tracks such as : Tuesday Afternoon Time to Get Away , of Forever Afternoon -RRB- , The Actor , Lovely to See You , Never Comes the Day , Gypsy , Its Up To You , Dawning is The Day , You Can Never Go Home , The Story in Your Eyes , New Horizons , The Land of Make-Believe , and Island .
 Justin Hayward wrote the bands UK # 2 hit , Question as well as Voices in the Sky , Driftwood , The Voice , Blue World , Your Wildest Dreams , I Know Youre Out There Somewhere , English Sunset and December Snow ; in all , writing 20 of the groups 27 post-1967 singles .

Nothing Changes etc. .
 The Moodies attempts to come up with another specific hit single during the 1967-68 period saw them record Three other Hayward compositions ; Long Summer Days , King and Queen and What Am US Doing Here ?
all of which were then left unissued , but together with unissued songs by Mike Pinder and John Lodge later formed the studio side four of Deccas 1977 release ; Caught Live Plus Five which largely comprised a December 1969 Live Recording of a concert at The Royal Albert Hall .
 Justin Hayward also co-wrote album tracks with Ray Thomas - Visions of Paradise , Are You Sitting Comfortably , Watching and Waiting , and much later Never Blame the Rainbows for the Rain , plus later co-wrote many songs with John Lodge for The Moodies , notably Gemini Dream , Meet Me Halfway , Talkin Talkin , Want To Be With You , Once is Enough , Strange Times , Sooner or Later among others .
 Haywards songs have opened each of The Moodies albums in Sooner or Later among others post Mike Pinder era since Long Distance Voyager in 1981 , and his songs , both solo compositions and co-written with John Lodge , plus his lead vocals , harmony voice , and guitar playing have been a major overriding factor in the bands work and continued success since 1981 .
 Sooner or Later among others album sales from 1978 to the present are more than 60 million .
 This is the regularly quoted total of their album sales , since the total sales of Sooner or Later among others albums before 1978 is disputed due to lack of official record company data , However the period 1967 to 1974 was when Sooner or Later among others albums were charting highest in the UK and US plus worldwide - Days of Future Passed topped the US album charts on re-issue in 1972 , then was followed into the album charts by the new studio album Seventh Sojourn .

 This is an India musical raga that appears in the Sikh tradition from northern India and is part of the Sikh holy scripture called Sri Guru Granth Sahib or Guru Granth Sahib for short .
 Every raga has a strict set of rules which govern the number of notes that can be used ; which notes can be used ; and This interplay that has to be adhered to for the composition of a tune .
 In the Guru Granth Sahib , the Sikh holy Granth there are a total of 31 raga compositions and this raga is the ninth raga to appear in the series .
The composition in this raga appear on a total of only 2 pages from page numbers 719 to 721 .
This raga appears in the Ragmala as the first ragini of Sri raga .
In the Mesakarna Ragmala , which is almost the same as that of the Guru Granth Sahib , the first ragini of Siri Raga is given as Vairati .
 However , modern sources do not give the old Bairari nor Vairati but Barari and Varari as well as Varati are listed .
 Kaufmann believes that all of these names refer to the same raga , Barari .
 Whether the same as the old Bairari is the same as the old Bairari is open to question .
 The possibility always exists that the old Bairari was a regional tune .
 The possibility was used by Guru Ram Das for six short hymns and by Guru Arjan for one .
This raga is performed during the evening and it is currently assigned to the Marva thata .
 It resembles Purva Kalyan , the main difference being the use of Pa which is strong in the old Bairari and weak in Purva-Kalyan .
Popley places Bairari in the same group as Sri Raga and this would agree with the Ragmala .
The following represents the order of notes that can be used on the ascending and descending phase of the composition and the primary and secondary notes : .
In the Guru Granth Sahib there are 2 pages dedicated to this raga from page 719 to 721

A raga is one of the melodic modes used in Indian classical music .
A raga uses a series of five or more musical notes upon which a melody is constructed .
However , the way the notes are approached and rendered in musical phrases and the mood they convey are more important in defining a raga than the notes themselves .
 In the Indian musical tradition , Janaka ragas are associated with different times of the day , or with seasons .
Indian classical music is always set in a raga .
Non-classical music such as popular Indian film songs and ghazals sometimes use ragas in their compositions .
Joep Bor of the Rotterdam Conservatory of Music defined Raga as tonal framework for composition and improvisation .
 Nazir Jairazbhoy , chairman of UCLA s department of ethnomusicology , characterized Janaka ragas as separated by scale , line of ascent and descent , transilience , emphasized notes and register , and intonation and ornaments .
The Sanskrit word raga is defined as the act of colouring or dyeing and therefore metaphorically means any feeling or passion especially love , affection , sympathy , desire , interest , motivation , joy , or delight .
Therefore , the word is used in the literal sense of the act of dyeing , and also color , hue , tint , especially the color red in the Sanskrit epics , and in the figurative sense of something that colors ones emotions .
A figurative sense of the word as passion , love , desire , delight is also found in the Mahabharata .
The specialized sense of loveliness , beauty , especially of voice or song , emerges in Classical Sanskrit , used by Kalidasa and in the Panchatantra .
 The term first occurs in a technical context in the Matangas Brihaddeshi , where The term is described as a combination of tones which , with beautiful illuminating graces , pleases the people in general .
Ragini is a term for the feminine counterpart or wife to a raga .
The raga-ragini scheme from about the 14th century aligned 6 male ragas with 6 wives .
Many Hindustani ragas are prescribed for the particular time of a day or a season .
When performed at the suggested time , the raga has its maximum effect .
For example , many of the Malhar group of ragas , which are ascribed the magical power to bring rain , are performed during the monsoon .
However , these prescriptions are not strictly followed , especially since modern concerts are generally held in the evening .
 There has also been a growing tendency over the last century for North Indian musicians to adopt South Indian ragas , which do not come with any particular time associated with North Indian musicians .
 The result of these various influences is that there is increasing flexibility as to when Janaka ragas may be performed .
 Although notes are an important part of raga practice , North Indian musicians alone do not make the raga .
A raga is more than a scale , and many ragas share the same scale .
The underlying scale may have five , six or seven tones , called swaras .
Ragas that have five swaras are called audava ragas ; those with six , shaadava ; and with seven , sampurna .
Those ragas that do not follow the strict ascending or descending order of swaras are called vakra ragas .
The mood of the raga and the way the notes are approached and used are more important than the notes it uses .
 For example , Darbari Kanada and Jaunpuri share the same notes but are entirely different in Darbari Kanada and Jaunpuri renderings .
 Similarly , although Bilaskhani Todi is classified under the Bhairavi thaat because of the notes Bilaskhani Todi uses , Bilaskhani Todi is actually closer to Bilaskhani Todi than to Bhairavi .
 The two streams of Indian classical music , Carnatic music and Hindustani music , have independent sets of Janaka ragas .
There is some overlap , but more false friendship .
In north India , the ragas have been primarily categorised into ten thaats or parent scales ; South India uses an older and even more systematic classification scheme called the melakarta classification , with 72 parent ragas .
Overall there is a greater identification of raga with scale in the south than in the north , where such an identification is impossible .
 Ragas in north Indian music system follow the law of consonances established by Bharata in Bharata Natyashastra , which does not tolerate deviation even at the shruti level .
 As Janaka ragas were transmitted orally from teacher to student , some ragas can vary greatly across regions , traditions and styles .
Many ragas have also been evolving over the centuries .
There have been efforts to codify and standardise raga performance in theory from their first mention in Matangas Brihaddeshi .
 In Carnatic music , Janaka ragas are classified as Janaka ragas and Janya ragas .
 Janaka ragas are the ragas from which the Janya ragas are created .
 Janaka ragas are grouped together using a scheme called Katapayadi sutra and are organised as Melakarta ragas .
A Melakarta raga is one which has all seven notes in both the arohanam and avarohanam .
 Some Melakarta ragas are Harikambhoji , Kalyani , Kharaharapriya , Mayamalavagowla , Sankarabharanam and Bilaskhani Todi .
 Janya ragas are derived from the Janaka ragas using a combination of the swarams from the parent raga .
 Some janya ragas are Abheri , Abhogi , Bhairavi , Hindolam , Mohanam and Kambhoji .
See the full List of Janya Ragas for more .
Each raga has a definite collection and orders of swaras .
 In Carnatic music , there are 7 basic notes of which there are a total of 16 varieties .
 The seven basic swarams of Carnatic music are : Sa , Ri , Ga , Ma , Pa , Da , Ni .
 Even though Janya ragas are subsets of Janaka ragas in notation and representation , the differences between the child ragas are clear due to the differences like : .
The effect of the ragas are different from each other , even if they notationally use same swarams due to above subjective differences related to bhava and rasa .
The artists have to ensure the same when elaborating on a raga , as has been followed and expected on each raga , without digressing into the phrases of another related raga .
The raga-ragini scheme is a classification scheme used from the 14th century to the 19th century .
It usually consists of 6 male ragas each with 6 wives and a number of sons and even daughters-in-law .
As it did not agree with various other schemes , and the related ragas had very little or no similarity , the raga-ragini scheme is no longer very popular .
 Janaka ragas and raginis were often pictured as Hindu gods , Rajput princes and aristocratic women in an eternal cycle of love , longing and fulfilment.raagwap and listen punjai songs online

Shankar Jaikishan , were a duo who composed Indian music for the Hindi film industry , who worked together from 1949-1971 .
Shankar-Jaikishan , along with other artists , wrote everlasting and immortal melodies in the fifties and sixties .
Their best work was noted for being raga-based and having both lilt and sonority .
Shankar Singh Raghuvanshi born in Gadarwara in Narsighpur district of Madhya Pradesh and moved to Hyderabad while Jaikishan Dayabhai Panchal belonged to Bansda , Gujarat .
 During Shankar Singh Raghuvanshi formative years , Shankar played the tabla and learned the art formally from Baba Nasir Khansahib .
For many years , Shankar studied as a disciple of the legendary composer Khawaja Khurshid Anwar , in whose orchestra he performed .
 his soul-mate Jaikishan was adept at playing the harmonium .
 Subsequently , his soul-mate Jaikishan obtained his soul-mate Jaikishan musical lessons from Sangeet Visharad Wadilalji and later from Prem Shankar Nayak .
 After moving to Mumbai , his soul-mate Jaikishan became a disciple of Vinayak Tambe .
Shankar started his career with a theater group run by Satyanarayan and Hemawati , before shifting to Prithvi Theatre where he played tabla and performed some minor roles in plays .
Shankar worked as assistant to the leading composer duo of Husnlal Bhagatram .
Apart from working at Prithvi theaters , Shankar used to frequently visit the office of a Gujrati director Chandravadan Bhatt who had promised Shankar that he would give him a break as a Music Director as and when he produced a film .
It was outside the office of Mr Bhatt that Shankar saw ` ek dubla patla sunder ladka also sitting a number of times .
 Although they never spoke to each other , one fine day , Shankar took the initiative of starting the conversation and then discovered that his name was his soul-mate Jaikishan and he too used to visit the same producer in search of some work related to music and that he was a Harmonium player .
Shankar later recollected that their vibes were right from the very beginning i.e. right from their first meeting itself they developed liking for each other and it was he who then and there assured Jaikishan of the job of a Harmonium player at Prithvi theaters .
Of course , later , Papaji honoured Shankars selection and gladly accepted Jaikishan as a Harmonium player at Prithvi .
Soon , the two of them developed very close friendship to the extent that the people started refererring to them as ` Ram-Lakshman ki jodi and by several similar-meaning nick names .
 It was during this phase that Shankar and his soul-mate Jaikishan developed a very deep bond of friendship , mutual understanding and regard for each other and made up their mind to work together as a musical team .
Apart from following their musical pursuits , they also used to play significant roles in various plays including the famous play Pathan .
 While working in Prithvi Theaters , Shankar and his soul-mate Jaikishan , apart from working in the music department there , used to compose tunes and were in touch with Raj Kapoor , who was working as an assistant to the famous director Kidar Sharma and was aspiring to be an actor/director .
Thus , the three had met at Prithvi Theater , run by Raj Kapoors father , Prithviraj Kapoor .
 Raj Kapoor made Raj Kapoor thus debut as a director with the film Aag in 1948 .
Its musical score .
 However , during the recording of some song for Raj Kapoor thus new venture Barsaat , Raj Kapoor had some serious differences with Ram Ganguly , the music composer of the film and decided to assign its music to Shankar who insisted on taking Jaikishan as his new venture Barsaat partner and thus came into existence the new pair of music directors named Shankar-Jaikishan who gave music for the RK production Barsaat in 1949 .
 his new venture Barsaat being a trained singer , Raj Kapoor thus , took on board , a completely new team of composers Shankar and his soul-mate Jaikishan and lyricists Shailendra , betrayal of Raj Kapoor and Hasrat Jaipuri .
 On the insistence of Shankar , he and SJ co-opted the upcoming singing talent Lata Mangeshkar , and repeated Mukesh as Raj Kapoors ghost voice for the various songs of his new venture Barsaat .
 the insistence of Shankar also had the distinction of giving two firsts to Hindi cinema - a title song and a cabaret .
 he and SJ early works include his new venture Barsaat , Awaara , Badal , Poonam , Nagina , Aurat , Parbat , Kaali Ghataa , Aah , Patita , Shikast , Badshah , Mayur Pankh , Naya Ghar , Seema , Shree 420 , Basant Bahar , Halaku , Patita , Rajhath , New Delhi , Kathputli , Anari , Chori Chori , Daag , Begunah , Yahudi , Main Nashe main hoon , Kanaiah , Boot Polish , Chhoti Behan , Sharaarat , Love Marriage , and Ujala .
 S-J formed a core team with lyricists Shailendra , betrayal of Raj Kapoor and Hasrat Jaipuri and with singers Mohammed Rafi and Lata Mangeshkar .
SJ had two other lifelong companions who worked as their assistants : Dattaram Wadkar and Sebastian DSouza , the former supervising their rhythm section and the later writing musical notations for all SJ compositions and then rehearsing all the musicians of the grand SJ orchestra according to SJs compositions and directions .
SJ also patronized the immensely talented singer Manna Dey , who sang his best songs with them and used Mukeshs silken voice as playback for Raj Kapoor .
 Among the directors , they worked most closely with Raj Kapoor and were considered the kingpins of Raj Kapoor thus legendary banner RK Films .
They were commercial geniuses in addition to be wonderfully god-blessed on music .
They lead the Bollywood music in spite of tough competition from maestros like Roshan , SD Burman , OP Nayyar and Madanmohan and remained on the top much to the chagrin of very highly talented music directors !

S-J worked with almost all singers of their time .
They had a good working relationship with all of them and were masters in extracting the very best from every one of them .
 They were steady as a team with Hasrat Jaipuri & Shailendra as their lyricists ; but after the demise of Shailendra , betrayal of Raj Kapoor , they worked with a host of other lyricists such as Indeevar , Gulshan Bawra , Neeraj , Verma Malik , Majrooh Sultanpuri , Vithhal Bhai Patel and Rajinder Krishan , to name a few .
 S-J were the house composers for RK Films and were on the house composers for RK Films pay-roll till the end .
 Raj Kapoor used to maintain a music bank where Raj Kapoor thus stored compositions of S-J .
 Even after the termination of the professional association between Shankar and Raj Kapoor , the latter had used a number of S-Js earlier compositions for all Raj Kapoor thus films though the credits were given officially to other composers , e.g. , Laxmikant Pyarelal and Ravindra Jain .
S-J also worked with other stars like Shammi Kapoor , Rajendra Kumar , Dev Anand , Sunil Dutt , Kishore Kumar , Manoj Kumar , Biswajeet , Joy Mukherjee , Dharmendra & Manoj Kumar .
 Most of S-Js films show Dattaram and Sebastian DSouza as Dattaram Wadkar and Sebastian DSouza assistants .
 Dattaram handled the percussion section of the orchestra and composed original beats , and Sebastian DSouza handled the rest .
Shankar met Dattaram when the latter was a page boy at Prithvi Theatres and stayed with him throughout .
 As recalled by Dattaram , Sebastian DSouza composed the musical background of most of S-Js songs and also conducted the orchestra .
Thus S-J were fortunate to have top quality assistants and used their talents well .
Shankar-Jaikishans compositions broke new ground in Hindi film music .
Apart from relying upon their knowledge of Indian classical music , they also employed western beats and orchestration .
 Shankar-Jaikishan were the pioneers in establishing the role of the orchestra in song compositions as a medium to express and enhance the meanings and feelings of S-Js songs rather than using it just as a ` filler as per the prevalent practice before their advent on the scene .
They made use of the orchestra and musical instruments in their songs which consisted of the following format : The song starts with a ` prelude , then the mukhda starts and is followed by interlude containg music pieces on the orchestra .
With very few exceptions , they always used different interludes before each stanza .
Multi-layered music studded with counter melodies played by the orchestra accompanied while the mukhda or the antara of a song was being sung and finally came the ` epilogue - the music with which the song ended after the singer had finished their singing .
Shankar-Jaikishan made a significant contribution in promoting Indian classical music throughout their career .
It was their established practice to have at least one song in a movie based on semi-classical style .
 These included S-Js songs like ` Jhanak-jhanak tori baje payaliya , ` Chham chham baje re payaliya , ` Radhike tune bansari churayi , ` Manmohana bade jhoothe , ` Koi matwala aya mere dware , ` Ajahu na ayae baalma , sawan beeta jaye , ` Lapak jhpak tu aa re badarwa , ` Manmohana barkha bahar sautaniya ke dwar , ` Re man sur mein ga , ` Sooni sooni sans ke sitar par , ` Kate na kate raina and numerous others .
 These music in ` Basant Bahar and Amrapali both of which had every song based upon Indian classical music .
 While raga Bhairavi remained These perennial favorite , SJ used a variety of Raagas in These compositions .
Shankar Jaikishan also used the western classical - based waltz rhythm in a number of songs .
 Shankar-Jaikishan gave a new style and meaning to the genre of sad songs by composing These on a fast tempo .
Songs like Zindagi Mein Hardam Rota Hi Raha , Tera Jana Dil Ke Armanon , Haye Tu Hi Gaya Mohe Bhool Re , Aye Mere Dil Kahin Aur Chal and Andhe Jahan Ke Andhe Raate demonstrated this .
The last two songs , along with many others , also demonstrate the composers ' use of musical instruments - a harmonium is used to produce the effect of a piano accordion .
 While working as a team , Shankar and his soul-mate Jaikishan used to compose their songs separately .
 Generally , Shankar liked to work with Shailendra , betrayal of Raj Kapoor and his soul-mate Jaikishan with Hasrat Jaipuri though there are notable instances where Shankar worked with Hasrat Jaipuri and his soul-mate Jaikishan with Shailendra , betrayal of Raj Kapoor .
 Between the two , Shankar was the senior partner and hence , he would usually arrange the orchestra , even for his soul-mate Jaikishan songs .
There was a gentlemans agreement between them for not identifying the actual composer of the song .
 As a result , it has been a popular pastime for S-J aficionados to try to tell a Shankar song from a his soul-mate Jaikishan song .
 Dance numbers , title/theme songs and soulful songs were as much Shankars forte while Jaikishan was a master of composing background score , apart from romantic songs and simple , catchy compositions which became instant hits .
However , Shankar was no less in this aspect of devising simple straight line tunes : Mera Joota Hai Japani being the best example of this genre .
 It is said that his soul-mate Jaikishan would count some numbers on his soul-mate Jaikishan fingers before coming up with the background score for a particular scene on the spot !
Two of S-Js films , viz. , Sangam and Mera Naam Joker are regarded even today as having some of the best background musical scores of Hindi films till date .
 Although Jaikishan alone used to work on background scores of SJ movies , it may be an over-simplification to presume that whatever went in background scores was solely his soul-mate Jaikishan creation .
 Since SJ had a common pool of tunes in their stock , made by either of them or by both of them jointly during their numerous music sessions/sittings , it would have been perfectly legitimate and natural for his soul-mate Jaikishan to have used tunes created by either or both partners wherever needed .
 It is understood that in RK films , Shankar and his soul-mate Jaikishan both used to work on the background scores .
 On the other hand , both Shankar and his soul-mate Jaikishan were equally proficient in scoring western music based S-Js songs .
 Despite both Shankar and Jaikishan distinct working styles and preferences , it is very difficult , if not altogether impossible , to ascribe most of both Shankar and Jaikishan songs to only one of them .
 In most of the songs , both Shankar and Jaikishan invariably contributed to one anothers creation , either in the form of improvisation of tune or of orchestration , thus , making both Shankar and Jaikishan compositions truly a joint effort .
Furthermore , each of the two could compose in others style now and then thereby making the identification still more difficult .
Contrary to the popular mis-conception that ` it was Jaikishan who used to handle the public relations and business/financial aspects of the duos career , the fact is that it was Shankar who had the final say on all financial/business aspects of the SJ-team .
Shankar Jaikishan made a major contribution towards the development of Jazz music in India and the new genre Indo Jazz .
 Their 1968 album Raaga-Jazz style is the earliest Indo-Jazz recording in India .
In this album , considered to be one of the most innovative , SJ created 11 songs based on Indian Ragas with saxophone , trumpet , sitar , tabla , bass etc. .
During their career , S-J won Filmfare Best Music Director Awards nine times .
The last three awards were won in three successive years , thereby making S-J the first composers to score a hat trick of these awards .
S-J also came out tops in Binaca Geetmala , the legendary countdown radio program on Hindi film music , where their compositions were declared the most popular on six occasions .
These songs were Mera Joota Hai Japani in 1955 , Teri Pyari Pyari Surat Ko in 1961 , Ehsaan Tera Hoga Mujh Par in 1962 , Bol Radha Bol in 1964 , Baharon Phool Barsaao in 1966 , and Zindagi Ek Safar Hai Suhana in 1971 .
In 1959 , seven of the top ten songs for the year were composed by S-J , a sort of record that stands perhaps to this date , though the top honors for that year went to SD Burman .
 The so-called disputes/differences between Shankar and his soul-mate Jaikishan .
 In a signed article in Filmfare , his soul-mate Jaikishan identified unwittingly the song Yeh Mera Prem Patra Padh Kar as Filmfare composition .
 This led to a lot of bitterness between the two , as Shankar considered This a violation of the unwritten agreement between them .
 At about the same time , Shankar gave a break to singer Sharda and started promoting Sharda as the new singing sensation in preference over Lata Mangeshkar .
 his soul-mate Jaikishan , however , stuck to Lata Mangeshkar for his soul-mate Jaikishan compositions .
 In this period , Shankar and his soul-mate Jaikishan started taking individual contracts for his legendary banner RK Films though every such film continued to show them together as the composers .
 the late Mohd .
 Mohammed Rafi intervened and helped them settle their differences ; however , it is conjectured that their relationship was not same as earlier and this impacted the quality of their compositions which had started exhibiting a decline .
 On the other hand , Jaikishan , Hasrat Jaipuri and Shankar all had denied , whenever quizzed on this topic , that there ever was any rift between them .
 In fact , according to Hasrat Jaipuri , the division of work was by mutual agreement to cope up with the heavy work load so that Shankar and Shailendra , betrayal of Raj Kapoor looked after one part of the work while Jaikishan and Hasrat on the other part but this division was not rigid ; there was a lot of give and take between them even during this phase .
 Towards the end , in several of their last movies such as Jane Anjane , Andaaz , Ankhon Ankhon Mein , Shankar and his soul-mate Jaikishan were known to be working together .
 In retrospect , it appears that the so-called rift between Shankar and his soul-mate Jaikishan was blown out of proportion by the media and vested interests and was used later to downgrade Shankar in his post-Jaikishan years .
 Since Shankar continued to support Sharda and even ghost-composed music for Sharda film and non-film albums , it is said that Lata Mangeshkar became angry with him and discontinued singing for him .
 Whereas there may be some truth in this assertion , the other fact is that Lata Mangeshkar had stopped working with him after Sangam due to Sangam anger against both Raj Kapoor and Shankar in making Sangam sing Budhha Mil Gaya from Sangam which Sangam was not keen as Sangam did not feel comfortable with the lyrics of the song .
 Nevertheless , Lata Mangeshkar herself continued singing for his soul-mate Jaikishan even after Sangam and till the end .
S-J enjoyed an unrivaled position in the Hindi film industry .
During their heyday and even toward the later part of their career , they were the highest paid music directors in the industry .
Barring stray exceptions , they were paid more than the leading actors and the promotional material of their films would give them more prominence than anyone else .
S-J staged a show in Shanmukhanad Hall , Mumbai in 1970 under the aegis of the Indian Navy .
In terms of attendance and grandeur , it remains unsurpassed to this day , thus providing a public seal of approval to their leading status in the industry .
 his soul-mate Jaikishan died in 1971 due to cirrhosis of liver , a disease caused by excessive consumption of alcohol .
 At the time of his soul-mate Jaikishan death , the duo enjoyed an unparalleled popularity which was underlined by a massive turnout at his soul-mate Jaikishan funeral procession .
 Gaylord , a restaurant at Churchgate where his soul-mate Jaikishan used to be a regular visitor , mourned the death of its illustrious patron by lighting a candle on Gaylord favorite table for one month and keeping it out of bounds for other guests with the sign Reserved for Mr. Jaikishan .
 After his soul-mate Jaikishan death , Shankar carried on with the banner of Shankar-Jaikishan alone .
 his soul-mate Jaikishan was clearly hampered by numerous reasons such as the departures of his soul-mate Jaikishan soul-mate his soul-mate Jaikishan and his soul-mate Jaikishan favorite lyricist Shailendra , betrayal of Raj Kapoor , betrayal of Raj Kapoor , continued Shankar-bashing and false propaganda by his soul-mate Jaikishan rivals and lack of motivation on his soul-mate Jaikishan own part due to which his soul-mate Jaikishan music appeared to suffer in comparison to S-Js own high standards .
 Also , in spite of his soul-mate Jaikishan continued experimentation on music , the projects themselves for which his soul-mate Jaikishan worked did not turn out to be commercial successes due to which even his soul-mate Jaikishan good scores went largely un-noticed .
According to Lata Mangeshkar herself , it was the late Mohd .
 Rafi who brought about a rapprochement between the two and Lata Mangeshkar herself did start singing again for Shankar starting from Sohan Lal Kanwars ` Sanyasi and several other films later .
 Although Shankars creations during this period for Lata Mangeshkar herself as well as other singers like Mohammed Rafi , Kishore Kumar , Manna Dey were quite good , most of These went un-noticed due to non-descript status of such films which bombed at the box office .
 Kishore Kumar most-successful musical hit was Sanyasi in 1975 for which Kishore Kumar scored all songs and the entire background score based upon SJs favorite Raag Bhairavi to prove the point that SJ Bhairavi was as much Shankars as that of Jaikishan !

 After Sanyasi , although some of as much Shankars later S-Js songs did exhibit flashes of the old maestros brilliance , overall , these films did not succeed in endearing Sanyasi to leading production houses , though there were some exceptions .
 For example , actor Dharmendra had signed Shankar to compose the score for his film Bichchhoo , however , since Shankar did not accept Sais intereference in his work , actor Dharmendra opted out of the project .
Eventually , the project itself was abandoned by producer-to-be Dharmendra .
 Shankar was in the running for Raj Kapoors film Satyam Shivam Sundaram , but was overlooked in favor of Laxmikant Pyarelal whose candidature was supported vigorously by Mukesh .
 Ironically , Mukesh owed Mukesh standing in the film industry primarily to S-Js compositions .
Shankar was also considered for Raj Kapoors proposed film Param Vir Chakra , but the project did not see the light of day and Shankar never returned to the RK camp .
Shankar died in 1987 .
His death received nominal media coverage and his funeral was attended only by his family and some friends .
The film industry was hardly represented at his funeral , thus reinforcing the stereotype of its fickle-natured loyalties .
 Raj Kapoor later paid glowing tributes to the colleague of Raj Kapoor thus salad days in a televised interview .
 However , it was only after Raj Kapoors own death in 1988 that the significance of Raj Kapoors film Satyam Shivam Sundaram association with S-J was brought out in great detail .
 Chandrakant Bhosle first noticed Shankarji , as Shankar was popularly known among his friends , in Mumbai in 1945 when Shankarji arrived in Mumbai with balle troup of guru Krishnankutty and dancer Hemawati .
 Chandrakant Bhosle was a tabla player and had become closely associated with Shankarji .
 Chandrakant Bhosle used to play rhythm in Shankarjis orchestra from 1945 until Shankarjis death .
 A night before Shankarjis death , i.e. on 25 April 1987 Shankarjis death , i.e. on 25 April 1987 dropped Bhosle near Charni Road railway station where Chandrakant Bhosle stayed and drove off to Chandrakant Bhosle own residence at Churchgate .
 On 26 April Bhosle was , as usual , waiting for Shankarji at around 10.00 a.m. to take Shankarji at around 10.00 a.m. to the studio , but Shankarji at around 10.00 a.m. did not turn up so Chandrakant Bhosle went to the studio by taxi .
 All the musicians waited the whole day for Shankarji at around 10.00 a.m. in the studio but Shankarji at around 10.00 a.m. didnt turn up .
 The next day , Chandrakant Bhosle read the news of Shankarjis death on 26 April 1987 .
 Unfortunately , family members with whom Shankarjis was staying did not inform Chandrakant Bhosle , Raj Kapoor or anybody from the film fraternity about Shankarjis death .
 It was Mr. Gokhale , who was once a cook in Shankarjis house , who later became Pujari in Gora Ram Mandir at Thakurdwar , Mumbai , who informed people that Shankarjis was cremated hastily on the day of Shankarjis death , without the knowledge of others .
Chandrakant Bhosle is now settleled in GOPURAM ShriRang Nagar , Near Rathi Amrai , Gangapur Road , Nashik , Maharashtra
Hindustani classical music is the Hindustani or North Indian style of Indian classical music found throughout the northern Indian subcontinent .
The style is sometimes called North Indian classical music or Shastriya Sangit .
It is a tradition that originated in Vedic ritual chants and has been evolving since the 12th century CE , primarily in what is now North India , Pakistan and Bangladesh and to some extent in Nepal and Afghanistan .
 Today , it is one of the two subgenres of Indian classical music , the other being the Carnatic music , the classical tradition of South India .
 The tradition was born out of a cultural synthesis of several musical traditions : the Vedic chant tradition , dating back to more than three thousand years ago , the ancient the Persian tradition of Musiqi-e assil , and various folk traditions prevalent in the region .
 the classical tradition of South India is traditional for performers who have reached a distinguished level of achievement to be awarded titles of respect ; Hindus are usually referred to as pandit and Muslims as ustad .
An aspect of Hindustani music going back to Sufi times is the tradition of religious neutrality : Muslim ustads may sing compositions in praise of Hindu deities , and vice versa .
 Around the 12th century , Hindustani classical music diverged from what eventually came to be identified as the Carnatic classical music .
The central notion in both these systems is that of a melodic mode or raga , sung to a rhythmic cycle or tala .
 The tradition dates back to the ancient the Samaveda , , which deals with the norms for chanting of srutis or hymns such as the Rig Veda .
These principles were refined in the musical treatises Natya Shastra , by Bharata , and Dattilam .
 In medieval times , the melodic systems were fused with ideas from the Persian music , particularly through the influence of Sufi composers like Amir Khusro , and later in the Moghul courts .
 Noted composers such as the musician Tansen flourished , along with religious groups like the Vaishnavites .
After the 16th century , the singing styles diversified into different gharanas patronized in different princely courts .
Around 1900 , Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande consolidated the musical structures of Hindustani classical music , called ragas , into a number of thaats .
Indian classical music has seven basic notes with five interspersed half-notes , resulting in a 12-note scale .
Unlike the 12-note scale in Western music , the base frequency of the scale is not fixed , and intertonal gaps may also vary ; however , with the gradual replacement of the sarangi by the harmonium , an equal tempered scale is increasingly used .
The performance is set to a melodic pattern called a raga characterized in part by specific ascent and descent sequences , which may not be identical .
Other characteristics include king and queen notes and characteristic phrases .
In addition each raga has its natural register and portamento rules .
Performances are usually marked by considerable improvisation within these norms .
Music was first formalized in India in connection with preserving the sruti texts , primarily the four vedas , which are seen as apaurasheya .
Not only was the text important , but also the manner in which they had been enunciated by the immortals .
Prosody and chanting were thus of great importance , and were enshrined in the two vedangas called shiksha and chhandas ; these remained a key part of the brahmanic educational system till modern times .
 The formal aspects of the chant are delineated in the the Samaveda , with certain aspects , e.g. the relation of chanting to meditation , elaborated in the Chandogya Upanishad .
Priests involved in these ritual chants were called samans and a number of ancient musical instruments such as the conch , lute , flute , trumpets and horns were associated with this and later practices of ritual singing .
The Samaveda outlined the ritual chants for singing the verses of the Rigveda , particularly for offerings of Soma .
 the Samaveda proposed a tonal structure consisting of seven notes , which were named , in descending order , krusht , pratham , dwitiya , tritiya , chaturth , mandra and atiswar .
These refer to the notes of a flute , which was the only fixed-frequency instrument .
This is why the second note is called pratham .
Music is dealt with extensively in the Valmiki Ramayana .
Narada is an accomplished musician , as is Ravana ; Saraswati with her veena is the goddess of music .
Gandharvas are presented as spirits who are musical masters , and the gandharva style looks to music primarily for pleasure , accompanied by the soma rasa .
 In the Vishnudharmottara Purana , the Naga king Ashvatara asks to know the svaras from Saraswati with her veena .
The most important text on music in the ancient canon is Bharata s Natya Shastra , composed around the 3rd century CE .
 The Natya Shastra deals with the different modes of music , dance , and drama , and also the emotional responses Bharata s Natya Shastra are expected to evoke .
The scale is described in terms of 22 micro-tones , which can be combined in clusters of four , three , or two to form an octave .
 While the term raga is articulated in the Natya Shastra , The Natya Shastra finds a clearer expression in what is called jati in the Dattilam , a text composed shortly after or around the same time as Natya Shastra .
The Dattilam is focused on gandharva music and discusses scales , defining a tonal framework called grama in terms of 22 micro-tonal intervals comprising one octave .
It also discusses various arrangements of the notes , the permutations and combinations of note-sequences , and alankara or elaboration .
 Dattilam categorizes melodic structure into 18 groups called jati , which are the fundamental melodic structures similar to the raga .
The names of the jatis reflect regional origins , for example andhri and oudichya .
Music also finds mention in a number of texts from the Gupta period ; Kalidasa mentions several kinds of veena , as well as percussion instruments , the flute and conch .
Music also finds mention in Buddhist and Jain texts from the earliest periods of the Christian era .
Narada s Sangita Makarandha treatise , from about 1100 CE , is the earliest text where rules similar to those of current Hindustani classical music can be found .
 Narada actually The names of the jatis and classifies the system in its earlier form before the Persian influences introduced changes in the system .
 Jayadeva , Vidyapati , Chandidas s Gita Govinda from the 12th century was perhaps the earliest musical composition sung in the classical tradition called Ashtapadi music .
 In the 13th century , Sharngadeva composed the Sangita Ratnakara , which has names such as the turushka todi , revealing an influx of ideas from Persian music from Islamic culture .
 This text is the last to be mentioned by both the the Carnatic and the Hindustani traditions and is often thought to date the divergence between the two .
 The advent of Islamic rule under the Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire over northern India caused considerable cultural interchange .
Increasingly , musicians received patronage in the courts of the new rulers , who in their turn , started taking increasing interest in local music forms .
 While the initial generations may have been rooted in cultural traditions outside India in connection , they gradually adopted many aspects from their kingdoms which retained the traditional Hindu culture .
 This helped spur the fusion of Hindu and Muslim ideas to bring forth new forms of musical synthesis like qawwali and khyal .
 The most influential musician of the Delhi Sultanate Sultanate period was Amir Khusrau , sometimes called the father of modern Hindustani classical music .
 A composer in the Persian , Turkish , Arabic , as well as Braj Bhasha , the Persian is credited with systematizing many aspects of Hindustani music , and also introducing several ragas such as Yaman Kalyan , Zeelaf and Sarpada .
 the Persian created the qawwali genre , which fuses the Persian melody and beat on a dhrupad like structure .
 A number of instruments were also introduced in the Persian time .
 Amir Khusrau is sometimes credited with the origins of the khyal form , but the record of Amir Khusrau compositions do not appear to support this .
The compositions by the court musician Sadarang in the court of Muhammad Shah bear a closer affinity to the modern khyal .
 They suggest that while khyal already existed in some form , the court musician Sadarang may have been the father of modern khyal .
 Much of the musical forms innovated by these pioneers merged with the Hindu tradition , composed in the popular language of the people in the work of composers like Kabir or Nanak .
 This can be seen as part of a larger Bhakti tradition , which remained influential across several centuries ; notable figures include Jayadeva , Vidyapati , Chandidas , Vidyapati , Chandidas , and Meerabai .
 As the Mughal Empire came into closer contact with Hindus , especially under Jalal ud-Din Akbar , music and dance also flourished .
In particular , the musician Tansen introduced a number of innovations , including ragas and particular compositions .
 Legend has it that upon the musician Tansen rendition of a night-time raga in the morning , the entire city fell under a hush and clouds gathered in the sky , and that the musician Tansen could light fires by singing the raga Deepak , which is supposed to be composed of notes in high octaves .
At the royal house of Gwalior , Raja Mansingh Tomar also participated in the shift from Sanskrit to the local idiom as the language for classical songs .
 Raja Mansingh Tomar Raja Mansingh Tomar penned several volumes of compositions on religious and secular themes , and was also responsible for the major compilation , the Mankutuhal , which outlined the major forms of music prevalent at the time .
 In particular , the musical form known as dhrupad saw considerable development in Raja Mansingh Tomar court and remained a strong point of the Gwalior gharana for many centuries .
After the dissolution of the Mughal empire , the patronage of music continued in smaller princely kingdoms like Lucknow , Patiala , and Banaras , giving rise to the diversity of styles that is today known as gharanas .
 Many musician families obtained large grants of land which made Many musician families self-sufficient , at least for a few generations .
Meanwhile the Bhakti and Sufi traditions continued to develop and interact with the different gharanas and groups .
Until the late 19th century , Hindustani classical music was imparted on a one-on-one basis through the guru-shishya tradition .
This system had many benefits , but also several drawbacks ; in many cases , the shishya had to spend most of his time serving his guru with a hope that the guru might teach him a cheez or two .
In addition , the system forced the music to be limited to a small subsection of the Indian community .
To a large extent it was limited to the palaces and dance halls .
It was shunned by the intellectuals , avoided by the educated middle class , and in general looked down upon as a frivolous practice .
Then a fortunate turn of events started the renaissance of Hindustani classical music .
First , as the power of the maharajahs and nawabs declined in early 20th century , so did their patronage .
 With the expulsion of Wajid Ali Shah to Calcutta after 1857 , the Lucknavi musical tradition came to influence the music of renaissance in 19th-century Bengal , giving rise to the tradition of Ragpradhan gan around the turn of the century .
Also , at the turn of the century , two great stars emerged on the horizon : Vishnu Digambar Paluskar and Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande .
Independent of each other , they spread Hindustani classical music to the masses in general , and the Marathi middle class in particular .
These two gentlemen brought classical music to the masses by organizing music conferences , starting schools , teaching music in class-rooms , and devising a standardized grading and testing system , and by standardizing the notation system .
Vishnu Digambar Paluskar emerged as a talented musician and organizer despite having been blinded at age 12 .
 Vishnu Digambar Paluskar books on music , as well as the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya music school that Vishnu Digambar Paluskar opened in Lahore in 1901 , helped foster a movement away from the closed gharana system .
Paluskars contemporary Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande recognized the many rifts that had appeared in the structure of Indian classical music .
 He undertook extensive research visits to a large number of gharanas , Hindustani as well as the Carnatic , collecting and comparing compositions .
Between 1909 and 1932 , he produced the monumental four-volume work Hindustani Sangeetha Padhathi , which suggested a transcription for Indian music , and described the many traditions in this notation .
 Finally , it consolidated the many musical forms of Hindustani classical music into a number of thaats , subsequent to the Melakarta system that reorganized the Carnatic tradition in the 17th century .
The ragas as they exist today were consolidated in this landmark work , although there are some inconsistencies and ambiguities in Bhatkandes system .
 The now tiny state of Goa has contributed a lot to Indian Classical music.Some of the renowned singers from 19th,-21st century hail from the state of Goa where the music was kept alive in the temples .
In modern times , the government-run All India Radio , Bangladesh Betar and Radio Pakistan helped to bring the artists to public attention , countering the loss of the patronage system .
The first star was Gauhar Jan , whose career was born out of Fred Gaisberg s first recordings of Indian music in 1902 .
With the advance of films and other public media , musicians started to make their living through public performances .
 As India in connection was exposed to Western music , some Western melodies started merging with classical forms , especially in popular music .
A number of Gurukuls , such as that of Alauddin Khan at Maihar , flourished .
In more modern times , corporate support has also been forthcoming , as at the ITC Sangeet Research Academy .
Meanwhile , Hindustani classical music has become popular across the world through the influence of artists such as Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan .
The rhythmic organization is based on rhythmic patterns called tala .
The melodic foundations are called ragas .
One possible classification of ragas is into melodic modes or parent scales , known as thaats , under which most ragas can be classified based on the notes they use .
Thaats may consist of up to seven scale degrees , or swara .
 Hindustani musicians name these pitches using a system called Sargam , the equivalent of the Western movable do solfege : .
Both systems repeat at the octave .
The difference between sargam and solfege is that re , ga , ma , dha , and ni can refer to either Natural or altered Flat or Sharp versions of their respective scale degrees .
As with movable do solfege , the notes are heard relative to an arbitrary tonic that varies from performance to performance , rather than to fixed frequencies , as on a xylophone .
The fine intonational differences between different instances of the same swara are called srutis .
The three primary registers of Indian classical music are mandra , madhya and taar .
Since the octave location is not fixed , it is also possible to use provenances in mid-register for certain ragas .
A typical rendition of Hindustani raga involves two stages : .
Hindustani classical music is primarily vocal-centric , insofar as the musical forms were designed primarily for vocal performance , and many instruments were designed and evaluated as to how well they emulate the human voice .
The major vocal forms or styles associated with Hindustani classical music are dhrupad , khyal , and tarana .
Other forms include dhamar , trivat , chaiti , kajari , tappa , tap-khyal , ashtapadis , thumri , dadra , ghazal and bhajan ; these are folk or semi-classical or light classical styles , as they often do not adhere to the rigorous rules of classical music .
Dhrupad is an old style of singing , traditionally performed by male singers .
 Dhrupad is performed with a tambura and a pakhawaj as instrumental accompaniments .
 The lyrics , some of which were written in Sanskrit centuries ago , are presently often sung in brajbhasha , a medieval form of North and East Indian languages that was spoken in Eastern India .
The rudra veena , an ancient string instrument , is used in instrumental music in dhrupad .
Dhrupad music is primarily devotional in theme and content .
It contains recitals in praise of particular deities .
Dhrupad compositions begin with a relatively long and acyclic alap , where the syllables of the following mantra is recited : .
The alap gradually unfolds into more rhythmic jod and jhala sections .
These sections are followed by a rendition of bandish , with the pakhawaj as an accompaniment .
 The great Indian musician the musician Tansen sang in the dhrupad style .
A lighter form of dhrupad , called dhamar , is sung primarily during the festival of Holi .
 Dhrupad was the main form of northern Indian classical music until two centuries ago , when Dhrupad gave way to the somewhat less austere khyal , a more free-form style of singing .
 Since losing Dhrupad main patrons among the royalty in Indian princely states , dhrupad risked becoming extinct in the first half of the twentieth century .
 However , the efforts by a few proponents from the Dagar family have led to Dhrupad revival and eventual popularization in India in connection and in the West .
 Some of the best known vocalists who sing in the Dhrupad style are the members of the Dagar lineage , including the senior Dagar brothers , Nasir Moinuddin and Nasir Aminuddin Dagar ; the junior Dagar brothers , Nasir Zahiruddin and Nasir Faiyazuddin Dagar ; and Wasifuddin , Fariduddin , and Sayeeduddin Dagar .
Other leading exponents include the Gundecha Brothers , who have received training from some of the Dagars .
 Leading vocalists outside the Nasir Aminuddin Dagar lineage include the Mallik family of Darbhanga tradition of musicians ; some of the leading exponents of this tradition were Ram Chatur Mallick , Siyaram Tiwari , and Vidur Mallick .
 A section of dhrupad singers of Delhi Sultanate Gharana from Mughal emperor Shah Jahan 's court migrated to Bettiah under the patronage of the Bettiah Raj , giving rise to the Bettiah Gharana .
 Bishnupur Gharana , based in West Bengal , is a key school that has been propagating this style of singing since Mughal times .
 Khyal is a Hindustani form of vocal music , adopted from medieval the Persian music and based on Dhrupad .
Khyal , literally meaning thought or imagination in Hindustani , is unusual as it is based on improvising and expressing emotion .
A Khyal is a two - to eight-line lyric set to a melody .
The lyric is of an emotional account possibly from poetic observation .
 Khyals are also popular for depicting the emotions between two lovers , situations of ethological significance in Hinduism and Islamic , or other situations evoking intense feelings .
Khyal contains a greater variety embellishments and ornamentations compared to dhrupad .
Khyal s romanticism has led to it becoming to most popular genre of Hindustani classical music .
Th importance of the Khyals content is for the singer to depict , through music in the set raga , the emotional significance of the Khyal .
The singer improvises and finds inspiration within the raga to depict the Khyal .
 The origination of Khyal is controversial , although it is accepted that this style was based on Dhrupad and influenced by the Persian music .
Many argue that Amir Khusrau created the style in the late 16th century .
 This form was popularized by Mughal Emperor Mohammad Shah , through Mohammad Shah court musicians .
 Some well-known composers of this period were the court musician Sadarang , Adarang , and Manrang .
Another vocal form , taranas are medium - to fast-paced songs that are used to convey a mood of elation and are usually performed towards the end of a concert .
They consist of a few lines of poetry with soft syllables or bols set to a tune .
The singer uses these few lines as a basis for fast improvisation .
 The tillana of the Carnatic music is based on the tarana , although the former is primarily associated with dance .
 Tappa is a form of Indian semi-classical vocal music whose specialty is The tillana of Carnatic music rolling pace based on fast , subtle , knotty construction .
It originated from the folk songs of the camel riders of Punjab and was developed as a form of classical music by Mian Ghulam Nabi Shori or Shori Mian , a court singer for Asaf-Ud-Dowlah , the Nawab of Awadh .
Nidhubabur Tappa , or tappas sung by Nidhu Babu were very popular in 18th and 19th-century Bengal .
Among the living performers of this style are Laxmanrao Pandit , Shamma Khurana , Manvalkar , Girija Devi , Ishwarchandra Karkare , and Jayant Khot .
Thumri is a semi-classical vocal form said to have begun in Uttar Pradesh with the court of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah , .
 There are three types of thumri : poorab ang , Lucknavi and Punjabi thumri .
The lyrics are typically in a proto-Hindi language called Brij Bhasha and are usually romantic .
Some recent performers of this genre are Abdul Karim Khan , the brothers Barkat Ali Khan and Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , Begum Akhtar , Girija Devi , Beauty Sharma Barua , Nazakat-Salamat Ali Khan , Pt Ajoy Chakrabarty , Prabha Atre , Siddheshwari Devi , and Shobha Gurtu .
 Ghazal is an originally the Persian form of poetry .
 In the Indian sub-continent , Ghazal became the most common form of poetry in the Urdu language and was popularized by classical poets like Mir Taqi Mir , Ghalib , Daagh , Zauq and Sauda amongst the North Indian literary elite .
 Vocal music set to this mode of poetry is popular with multiple variations across Iran , Afghanistan , Central Asia , Turkey , India in connection , Bangladesh and Pakistan .
 Ghazal exists in multiple variations , including semi-classical , folk and pop forms .
Although Hindustani music clearly is focused on the vocal performance , instrumental forms have existed since ancient times .
In fact , in recent decades , especially outside South Asia , instrumental Hindustani music is more popular than vocal music , partly due to a somewhat different style and faster tempo , and partly because of a language barrier for the lyrics in vocal music .
A number of musical instruments are associated with Hindustani classical music .
 The veena , a string instrument , was traditionally regarded as the most important , but few play it today and it has largely been superseded by its cousins the sitar and the sarod , both of which owe their origin to the Persian influences .
Other plucked or struck string instruments include the surbahar , sursringar , santoor , and various versions of the slide guitar .
Among bowed instruments , the sarangi , esraj and violin are popular .
The bansuri , shehnai and harmonium are important wind instruments .
In the percussion ensemble , the tabla and the pakhavaj are the most popular .
Various other instruments have also been used in varying degrees

The Jaipur-Atrauli gharana is a Khayal - based stylized singing family-hood , founded by Utd .
Alladiya Khan in the late 19th century .
 Evolved from Dhrupad singing , the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana acquired Dhrupad singing name and status as a Gharana in the early half of the 20th century as a result of the growing popularity of stalwarts of this Gharana , like Smt .
Kesarbai Kerkar , Smt .
Mogubai Kurdikar and Pt .
Mallikarjun Mansur .
The founder of this gharana , Utd .
 Alladiya Khan initially developed the unique Gayaki of this Gharana following the loss of Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan voice which prompted Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan to develop an adjusted singing style to accommodate Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan ailment .
Signature and specialty Raags of this Gharana include Sampoorna Malkauns , Basanti Kedar , Basant Bahar , Bihagda , Kaushi Kanada , and Nat Kamod among others .
 Four major Gharanas are recognized in Hindustani Classical Khayal music : Gwalior , Agra , Kirana and Jaipur-Atrauli .
Others are less pervasive , but no less enchanting , such as Indore , Rampur , Mewati , Patiala , and Bhendi-Bazar .
 The Jaipur-Atrauli gharana acquired its name and status as a Gharana from the time of Alladiya Khan in the early half of the 20th century .
 This Gharana mainly evolved from Dagar-bani of Dhrupad , however Dagar-bani of Dhrupad also absorbed finer essence of Gauhar-bani and Khandar-bani .
 The ancestral origin of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana was said to be from Nath Vishwambhar , noted for setting to the Raags the tunes of the shlokas in Nath Vishwambhar puja .
The great musician composer Swami Haridas was also born in this family and the great Tansen and Baiju were his pupils .
 Natthu Khan and Mantol Khan were two stalwarts of this Gharana , Four to five generations down the line .
 Natthu Khan and Mantol Khan imbibed the practices of both Hindu and Muslim traditions .
 Alladiya Khan , for instance , wore the Janva all Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan life , dressed like a Maharashtrian , complete with the Kolhapuri turban , yet did not skip a day of Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan Namaaz .
 Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan compositions praise Mahadev and Allah with equal fervor .
 Many of the the Raags and His compositions sung in the Jaipur Gayaki gharana come from the tradition of Haveli Sangeet , like the compositions Deva Deva Satsang in Raag Savani Kalyan , Aadidata Ant in Raag Malkauns , Anahat Aadi Naad in Raag Savani Nat , Devta Aadi Sab in Raag Kukubh Bilawal , Devi Durge in Raag Sukhiya Bilawal , and a host of others in which Hindu devotional themes were used by Utd .
Alladiya Khan .
 Scholars say the hyphenated moniker of this Gharana recognizes that Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana musicians originally came from Atrauli near Aligarh and migrated to the court of the Maharaja of Jaipur Gayaki , Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana musicians principal patron .
 Others say Others came to the Jaipur Maharajas court and then dispersed to various other courts in the area , like Jodhpur , Uniyara , Bundi , Atrauli etc. .
After establishing himself in the north , Utd .
 Alladiya Khan migrated to the court of Shahu Maharaj in Kolhapuri and became Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan court musician .
Utd .
 Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan was initiated into music by Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan father , Khwaja Ahmad Khan and Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan uncle , Jehangir Khan in both the Dhrupad and the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana styles .
 Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan also had the privilege of being guided by two famous composers of the time , Ramzan Khan Rangeele and Mehboob Khan Darasapiya .
 The young Alladiya Khan was closely associated with Wazir Khan binkar at Indore and Bombay .
 The Meend of Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan gayaki can be traced to this influence .
Today , only the Khayal tradition remains .
 The Meend of his gayaki was known to have been greatly influenced by Utd .
Mubarak Khans style that blended the Swar and Taal aspects of khayal singing for the first time .
 Most gharanas apply notes in simple succession in aalap and taan , whereas in the Jaipur Gayaki gayaki , notes are applied in an oblique manner with filigree involving immediately neighboring notes .
Instead of the flat taan , gamak makes the taan spiral into seemingly never-ending cycles .
Meend in aalap and gamak in taan are the hallmark of this gayaki .
 To his immense credit , the great exponent of Kirana gharana , Bhimsen Joshi is one of the very few singers outside the Jaipur Gayaki gharana , who has adopted the gamak taan to an extent , complete with long , uninterrupted patterns clearly showing an amazing breath capacity much like the old masters of Jaipur Gayaki gharana , but he has not quite achieved the intricacy and grace of gamak that is the signature of Jaipur Gayaki .
Sharp edged harkats and murkis are relatively uncommon .
Not only are the notes sung in rhythm with the taal but progress between the matras is in fractions of quarters and one-eighths .
While being mindful of so many factors , musicians of this gharana still have a graceful way of arriving at the Sam without having matras to spare !
This is particularly evident in the way bol-alaap or bol-taan is sung , where meticulous attention is given to the short and long vowels in the words of the bandish that are being pronounced , and the strict discipline of avoiding unnatural breaks in the words and in the meaning of the lyrics .
No other gharana has paid so much attention to the esthetics and laykaari in singing bol-alaaps and bol-taans .
 A highlight of Jaipur Gayaki gayaki is the mastery over Jod Raags .
Singers from other Gharanas tend to sing one Raag in Aaroh and the other in Avaroh .
Some others sing one Raag in the lower half of the octave and then switch to the other Raag in the upper half .
 Alternatively , Some others may sing alternate phrases of the two component Raags .
 In Jaipur Gayaki , there is such perfect fusion of the two raags that Jaipur Gayaki sounds like a homogeneous Raag in Jaipur Gayaki own right , giving the feel of both component raags , not as a heterogeneous mixture cobbled together .
The listener hears an amalgam of both raags without losing their distinctive identity .
 Alladiya Khan introduced many lesser-known or obscure raags in Ghulam Ahmad Alladiya Khan repertoire like Raag Basanti Kedar , Raag Jait Kalyan , Raag Kafi Kanada , Raisa Kanada , Raag Basanti Kanada , Raag Savani Nat , Raag Savani Kalyan , Raag Bhoop Nat , Raag Nat Kamod , Raag Bihari , Raag Khat , Raag Khokar , Raag Sampoorna Malkauns , and many others .
Trying to imbibe all these characteristics without losing the aesthetics is a tall order for any musician .
 Hence this Gayaki is called a thinking listeners or connoisseurs Jaipur Gayaki .
 However , Jaipur Gayaki gives equal pleasure to the uninitiated listener who may not understand the technical intricacies , but responds to the layakari and the melodic content of the presentation .
The Gharana purity of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana has been an avid discussion topic among connoisseurs and scholars alike , as a result of Utd .
Alladiya Khan purposefully teaching students to approach the same musical content differently , causing internal quarrels within the Gharana itself , as well .
For instance , the approach to certain Raags conflict between branches of the Gharana , as certain elements of a Raag are neglected , emphasized , de-emphasized or treated differently .
 As a result , Scholars feel the purity of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana can be traced from Utd .
 Alladiya Khan to a Raag brother Utd .
 Haider Ali Khan , to Haider Ali Khan sons Utd .
Manji Khan and Utd .
 Bhurji Khan and Bhurji Khan grandson Ut Azizuddin Khan , as well as Utd .
Gulubhai Jasdanwalla , the only purist outside of the Utd .

Emily Erwin was born in Pittsfield , Massachusetts .
 Parents Paul Erwin and Barbara Trask moved the family to the northern suburban town of Addison , Texas on the edge of Dallas , where Barbara Trask was raised with Barbara Trask two older sisters , Julia and Martha .
 Barbara Trask parents were both educators and nurtured the growing interest that both Emily Erwin and Martha shared , and together both sisters became proficient on several instruments while in elementary school .
 Emily Erwin began playing the violin at age seven , and the banjo at age ten , afterward learning all the string instruments Emily Erwin could find .
 Years later , her sister Martie joked that Emily Erwin was better than Emily Erwin at the fiddle , and because Emily Erwin wanted to keep the fiddle as Emily Erwin instrument , her sister Martie forced Emily Erwin to learn something else .
 Emily Erwin responded by mastering the five string banjo , by reading books to teach Emily Erwin the chord progressions .
From 1984-1989 , Jane Frost , , remembers watching the sisters mature , teaming up with schoolmates Troy and Sharon Gilchrist .
 The foursome were touring in a teenage bluegrass group The foursome named the Blue Night Express , in part because of the amount of travelling The foursome had to do to reach far away festivals , frequently with a parent or friend of the family towing The foursome back home long after dark at night .
 The foursome thought it was worth the sacrifices to meet The foursome musical heroes and experienced the friendly camaraderie and tricks of the trade on instruments from others .
The sisters were said to have an almost obsessive interest in busking at small venues and attending bluegrass festivals .
 After her sister Martie graduated from secondary school at Greenhill School with Emily Erwin still completing Emily Erwin studies , both remained active in the bluegrass scene .
 In 1989 , after years of attending bluegrass festivals and busking where they could , Emily Erwin joined Emily Erwin sister her sister Martie , guitarist Robin Lynn Macy , and upright bass player Laura Lynch .
 Jane Frost , again , recalls being privy to the discussion that the four women had about the possibility of a successful career as musicians together .
 her sister Martie felt they could do well .
 Robin Lynn Macy said , .

 Its going to be a hot band , to which Emily Erwin responded , I give it six months , and if we arent making money by then , Im out of here !

 Emily Robison was shy , and the youngest member of the group .
 Emily Robison had enjoyed playing throughout school , but was at an age where Emily Robison was already entertaining thoughts of working hard to be accepted by the United States Air Force Academy .
By 1993 , the band had evolved into a new direction .
 Robin Lynn Macy left the group for a purer bluegrass sound .
 upright bass player Laura Lynch , thrust into the position of sole lead singer , was replaced by the sisters in 1995 with singer composer Natalie Maines after the group was unable to garner anything more than local interest .
 Emily Robison commented , We were prepared to pay We dues for as long as it took ; We were prepared for longevity .
 We know that We will always be playing music together , so We wanted to find someone who is just as determined and energetic as We are .
 But in later interviews , the sisters revealed what many had thought for a long time : the reason upright bass player Laura Lynch was replaced was not commitment but a perceived lack of talent .
 In an article in the April/May edition of Country Music Magazine , Emily Erwin stated , We felt We needed the next calibre of singer .
From there , massive commercial success ensued , with their 1998 and 1999 albums Wide Open Spaces and Fly both achieving diamond record status .
 Emily Robison was a key element of the groups look , with Emily Robison hair dyed blond to match the other two at first , and then allowing it to return to Emily Robison natural brunette color , and distinguishing Emily Robison visually from the other two .
 Emily Robison and Maguires instrumental virtuosity set the Chicks apart from many other country acts , male and female .
 Emily Robison songwriting has also been a factor in the Chicks recording career .
 Emily Robison stood by singer composer Natalie Maines when the controversy over singer composer Natalie Maines remarks about U.S. President George W. Bush hit the newswire on the eve before the Iraq War in 2003 .
 Emily Robison was the only bandmate to realize that , while in the U.K. , there was a big anti-war sentiment in the audience , but that back in the United States , singer composer Natalie Maines criticism of President Bush would not be well received .
 Nevertheless , even when Emily Robison home was trashed , and plenty of editorials were predicting the end of the Dixie Chicks successful careers in music , Emily Robison remained loyal to singer composer Natalie Maines , as did Emily Robison sister .
 Emily Robison spent at least half of her life busking and touring nearly non-stop since high school , first with Emily Robison older sister , and then with the changing lineups of the Dixie Chicks .
 After the bandmates celebrated their five Grammy Awards for Taking the Long Way , the trio all had young children and took time out to spend with them , but Emily Robison was eager to return to writing and touring .
 When Emily Robison marriage came to an end , Emily Robison began expressing Emily Robison by songwriting .
 Some of Emily Robison compositions include Some of her compositions feelings about the breakup with Some of her compositions former husband , and expected that soon , the band would resume its former schedule of writing and performing , but Natalie Maines was reluctant to do so .
 After four years , Emily Robison became angry and frustrated , and in sending Emily Robison new songs to Emily Robison sister , conveyed Emily Robison increasing disappointment .
 With Natalie Maines taking a break from music , Rolling Stone magazine announced in January 2010 that Emily Erwin and sister Martie have formed a side project called the Court Yard Hounds , with Emily Robison as lead vocalist .
The band made their live debut in March at South by Southwest with an album released in May , 2010 .
 Emily Robison wrote all but one of the songs on their album .
 On May 1 , 1999 , Emily Erwin married country singer Charlie Robison .
 her sister Martie later revealed on a VH-1 program that during their courtship , her sister Martie had written the romantic hit song , Cowboy Take I Away for them .
The Robisons have three children : Charles Augustus , called Gus , born November 11 , 2002 and twins Julianna Tex and Henry Benjamin born on April 14 , 2005 .
 Emily Erwin and Charlie divorced on August 6 , 2008 after nine years of marriage .

Zia Mohiuddin Dagar , popularly known as Z. M. Dagar , was a North Indian classical musician , one of the 19th generation of Dagar family dhrupad musicians .
 Zia Mohiuddin Dagar was largely responsible for the revival of the rudra vina as a solo concert instrument .
 Z. M. Dagar was born in the town of Udaipur , Rajasthan and began musical study with Z. M. Dagar father , Ustad Ziauddin Khan Dagar , court musician for the Maharana of Udaipur .
 Z. M. Dagar was trained both in vocals and in the rudra veena , an instrument used by vocalists to practice melodies .
 The veena was traditionally not played in public , but the young Zia Mohiuddin adopted it as the young Zia Mohiuddin primary instrument , giving the young Zia Mohiuddin first recital at age 16 .
 Although the young Zia Mohiuddin was discouraged by the young Zia Mohiuddin father from experimenting with the structure of the veena , the young Zia Mohiuddin nevertheless modified the instrument after the young Zia Mohiuddin fathers death to better equip it for solo performance , transforming it into a larger bass instrument : With the help of the instrument house Kanailal & Brother , the young Zia Mohiuddin enlarged the tumbas and dhandhi to create greater resonance and to allow the notes to sustain longer and so better reproduce the techniques used in dhrupad singing .
 Because of these modifications , the instrument was too heavy to be held in the standard Northern posture , so the young Zia Mohiuddin played instead in the Southern posture , with one tumba on the ground and one on the left knee .
After India gained independence the princely states were abolished .
 The Dagar family lost the patronage of the court of Udaipur , and had to seek employment elsewhere .
Finally they arrived in Mumbai .
For 25 years they had to make ends meet by working in garages , selling bread , and rarely , playing instruments for movie scores .
They did not have a tanpura , sitar , or veena , let alone a house .
There was much cynicism about dhrupad , as his son Bahauddin Mohiuddin Dagar recounted in an interview .
Dhrupad ?
Wholl listen ?
Rudra veena ?
Play something else .
Long alaaps ?
So boring !

 Z. M. Dagar was known particularly for Z. M. Dagar slow development of ragas , typically performed only with tanpura accompaniment , and for Z. M. Dagar meticulous attention to microtonal inflections .
 Z. M. Dagar was very active in the West , associating Z. M. Dagar with the American Society for Eastern Arts in Berkeley , California and with Wesleyan University , Rotterdam Music Conservatory , and the University of Washington , Seattle , where Z. M. Dagar was a visiting professor .
In 1990 , Ustad ji was awarded the Kalidas Samman , one of Indias most prestigious awards , by the Madhya Pradesh government .
 He also received the Sangeet Natak Academi Award , the Rajasthan Sangeet Natak Academi award , and the Maharana Kumbha award , to name a few .
 His younger brother , Ustad Zia Fariddudin Dagar , is a vocalist and teacher , and Ustad Zia Fariddudin Dagar son , Bahauddin Mohiuddin Dagar , is a vina player .
The concept of making a Gurukul was entirely Ustad Zia Mohiuddin Dagars .
 the Gurukul envisioned a place where the Gurukul would sit with the Gurukul disciple and .
impart training in the Guru Shishya Parampara a method in which a few selected students study under one roof whilst staying with the guru .
 Ustad sahib put at least twenty years of Ustad sahib time and effort to give shape to this idea on Ustad sahib own and thus , the Gurukul came into being in 1982 at Palaspa - a village near Panvel - Mumbai

Raga Bhoopeshwari is a rare Hindustani Classical Raga .
The Raga in not one of the traditional ragas of Hindustani Classical Music being sung for the past few centuries .
It has been developed within the last few decades .
The birth of this raga is something that eluded most people for a while .
It was believed that the raga was created by Ustad Alladiya Khan of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana .
However the time frame of Ustadjis lifetime and the ragas emergence do not match .
It is now however certain , that the raga was created by Pt .
Mani Prasad of the Kirana Gharana .
Apart from who created the raga , a major issue that arises is , how was it created ?
Being an audav raga , Raga Bhoopeshwari leads to a lot of ambiguity .
 Since the remaining notes/swars are unknown , it is quite difficult to determine the parent raga or scale of Raga Bhoopeshwari .
The raga does not fit into any of Bhatkhande s thats and so its origin is uncertain .
A similar problem persists in Carnatic Music as well .
 People associate A similar problem with the Melakarta Chakravam , Melakart Mararanjani , Melakarta Charukesi and even Melakarta Sarasangi , but no one is absolutely certain .
 Another matter of concern with the raga is Another matter of concern with the raga name .
The name Bhoopeshwari had an obvious inspiration from Raga Bhopali .
However , the raga has various names across India .
Pt .
Hariprasad Chaurasia , the legendary flutist , prefers the name Raga Bhoopkali , while most of the Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana musicians use Raga Prateeksha .
Other variations such as Bhoopeshri , Bhoopshri etc. are also present .
In Carnatic Music , the raga is called Raga Vaasanthi .
 Despite Carnatic Music complex origin and nomenclature , the raga isnt a very difficult one to sing .
 Carnatic Music has the same notes as Raga Bhopali / Deshkar , but instead of the shuddha Dha , uses a komal Dha .
The Raga is a morning raga .
Its designated time is the second prahar of the morning , from 6-9 a.m. Possibly due to its recent creation , the raga has not been performed very widely .
However , it has started being used in film music , light classcial music and ghazals .
Some of the most notable performances of Raga Bhoopeshwari are :

 Punjab Gharana , is a style and technique of Tabla playing that originated in the The Punjab Gharana region of what is now split in present day Pakistan and India .
The Punjab Gharana is one of the six Tabla Gharanas .
 Initially a pakhawaj-playing gharana , the The Punjab Gharana school was created in the nineteenth century .
There is debate as to who precisely set up the Gharana .
 Some believe Some was Lala Bhavanidas .
And others claim that the founder was Lala Bhavanidass follower , Mian Qadir Baksh I .
 Yet others are of the view that it was Saddu Hussain Baksh , follower of Qadir Baksh I who founded it .
Around the turn of the 20th century , Fakir Baksh , disciple of Saddu Hussain Baksh was the foremost advocate .
 Fakir Baksh was essentially a Pakhawaj player but certainly the first to introduce Tabla in this Gharana .
 Fakir Baksh disciples were Fakir Baksh son Qadir Baksh II besides many like Baba Malang , and Feroze Khan of Lahore .
Jnan Prakash Ghosh of Farukhabad gharana also studied with Feroze Khan .
Qadir Baksh II was the teacher of the most renowned tabla player of 20th century , Ustad Alla Rakha , besides Ustad Allah Ditta and Mia Shaukat Hussain and Tafo Khan .

Teacher of internationally renowned maestro Ustad Allah Rakha and several others like Ustad Allah Ditta and Mia Shaukat Hussain .
 An adept Pakhawaj player , Mia Qadir Baksh was noted for Mian Qadir Baksh I layakari and reputation as a dedicated teacher .
 Towards the end of Mian Qadir Baksh I life Mian Qadir Baksh I became a highly eccentric faqir .
 After Mian Qadir Baksh I death the khalifa-ship of the The Punjab Gharana gharana passed to Mian Qadir Baksh I nephew Khalifa Akhtar Hussain .
Teachers : Mian Qadir Bukhsh , Ustad Mashooqay Khan and Ustad Aslam Khan .

Abbaji also bridged the gap between Carnatic music and Hindustani music by playing with both renowned Carnatic musicians and other Hindustani stalwarts .

 Since then , Tari Khan has gone on to international fame as a tabla showman .
His International Kherwa was a popular item .
Zakir Hussain is easily the most famous and influential tabla player of the modern age .

A that is a mode in northern Indian or Hindustani music .
Thats always have seven different pitches and are a basis for the organization and classification of ragas in North Indian classical music .
The modern that system was created by Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande in the early decades of the twentieth century .
Bhatkhande modeled his system after the Carnatic melakarta classification , devised around 1640 A.D. by the musicologist Venkatamakhin .
Bhatkhande visited many of the gharanas of North Indian classical music , conducting a detailed analysis of Indian raga .
 His research led him to a system of ten thats , each named after a prominent raga associated with His research .
Many correspond to one or other of the European church modes .
 Many are listed here according to Many pitches ; lower-frequency pitches are represented with lowercase letters and higher-frequency pitches with uppercase letters .
One can arbitrarily designate any pitch as Sa and build the series from there .
While all thats contain seven notes , many ragas contain fewer than seven and some use more .
A raga need not use every swara in a given that ; the assignment is made according to whatever notes the raga does contain .
The relatively small number of thats reflects Bhatkhandes compromise between accuracy and efficiency : The degree of fit between a raga and its that is balanced with the desire to keep the number of basic thats small .
Ambiguities inevitably arise .
For example , Raga Hindol , assigned to Kalyan that , uses the notes S G M D N , which are also found in Marwa that .
Raga Jaijaivanti contains both shuddha nishad and komal nishad , which by definition corresponds to no that .
Bhatkande resolved such cases by an ad hoc consideration , appealing to musical performance practice .
Each that contains a different combination of altered and natural notes .
The flattening or sharpening of pitches always occurs with reference to the interval pattern in Bilawal that .
In effect only heptatonic diatonic scales are called that .
Bhatkhande applied the term that only to scales that fulfill the following rules : .
Ragas are normally ascribed to certain periods of the day and night .
 Narada s Sangita-Makaranda , written sometime between 7th and 11th century , gives warnings to musicians against playing Ragas at the incorrect time of day .
Traditionally , disastrous consequences are to be expected .
Bhatkhande stated that the correct time to play a raga had a relation to its that

Ustad Rashid Khan is an Indian classical musician in the Hindustani music tradition .
 Ustad Rashid Khan belongs to the Rampur-Sahaswan gharana , and is the great-grandson of gharana founder Inayat Hussain Khan .
 Ustad Rashid Khan is married to Soma Khan .
In a story told in several versions , it appears that Pandit Bhimsen Joshi said at one point , that Rashid Khan was the assurance for the future of Indian vocal music .
 Pandit Bhimsen Joshi was awarded the Padma Shri , as well as the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 2006 and Padma Bhushan in 2013 .
Born in Badayun , Uttar Pradesh .
 Pandit Bhimsen Joshi received Pandit Bhimsen Joshi initial training from Pandit Bhimsen Joshi maternal grand-uncle , Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan .
 Pandit Bhimsen Joshi is also the nephew of Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan .
As a child he had little interest in music .
 His uncle Ghulam Mustafa Khan was among the first to note His uncle Ghulam Mustafa Khan musical talents , and for some time trained His uncle Ghulam Mustafa Khan in Mumbai .
 However , His uncle Ghulam Mustafa Khan received His uncle Ghulam Mustafa Khan main training from Nissar Hussain Khan , initially at His uncle Ghulam Mustafa Khan house in Badayun .
A strict disciplinarian , Nissar Hussain Khan would insist on voice training from four in the morning , and make Rashid practice one note of the scale for hours on end .
A whole day would be spent on practising just a single note .
Although Rashid detested these lessons as a child , but the disciplined training shows in his easy mastery of taan and layakaari today .
 It was not until he was 18 that Ustad Rashid Khan began to truly enjoy Ustad Rashid Khan musical training .

 By 1994 , Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan was acknowledged as a musician at the academy .
 The Rampur-Sahaswan gayaki is closely related to the Gwalior gharana , which features medium-slow tempos , a full-throated voice and intricate rhythmic play .
 Rashid Khan includes the slow elaboration in Ustad Rashid Khan vilambit khayals in the manner of Ustad Rashid Khan maternal grand-uncle and also developed exceptional expertise in the use of sargams and sargam taankari .
 Ustad Rashid Khan is influenced with the style of Ustad Amir Khan and Pandit Bhimsen Joshi .
 Ustad Rashid Khan is also a master of the tarana like Ustad Rashid Khan guru but sings Ustad Amir Khan and Pandit Bhimsen Joshi in Ustad Rashid Khan own manner , preferring the khayal style rather than the instrumental stroke-based style for which Nissar Hussain was famous .
There is no imitation of instrumental tone .
 Ustad Rashid Khan mastery of all aspects tonal variations , dynamics and timbre adjustment leave very little to be desired in the realm of voice culture .
 Ustad Rashid Khan renderings stand out for the emotional overtones in Ustad Rashid Khan melodic elaboration .
 Ustad Rashid Khan says : The emotional content may be in the alaap , sometimes while singing the bandish , or while giving expression to the meaning of the lyrics .
 This brings a touch of modernity to Ustad Rashid Khan style , as compared to the older maestros , who placed greater emphasis on impressive technique and skillful execution of difficult passages .
Rashid Khan has also experimented with fusing pure Hindustani music with lighter musical genres , e.g. in the Sufi fusion recording Naina Piya Se , or in experimental concerts with western instrumentalist Louis Banks .
 Ustad Rashid Khan has also performed jugalbandis , along with sitarist Shahid Parvez and others

 Raga Bhairav , or Bhairon , is a raga in Hindustani classical music that was for centuries considered to be the most important raga .
Its modern form with an important komal rishabh is , however , very different from that described in the old texts .
 Raga Bhairav has its name from Bhairava , an incarnation of Shiva , and was historically associated with glory and awe , but became identified with peace and devotion .
Raga Bhairav is sometimes linked to raga Bhairavi via Bhairavis association with the consort of Bhairav of the same name ; Hijaz Bhairav is an example of this .
There are several allied ragas such as Ahir Bhairav , Bairagi , Gunkali , Hijaz Bhairav , Nat Bhairav , Ramkali , Jogiya and Kalingda .
This raga corresponds to Mayamalavagowla in Carnatic music .
 Bhairon appears in the Sikh tradition from northern India and is part of the Guru Granth Sahib .
Every raga has a strict set of rules which govern the number of notes that can be used ; which notes can be used ; and their interplay that has to be adhered to for the composition of a tune .
 In the Guru Granth Sahib , the Sikh holy Granth there are a total of 31 raga compositions and this raga is the twenty-fourth raga to appear in the series .
The composition in this raga appear on a total of 43 pages from page numbers 1125 to 1168 .
 Raga Bhairav was an important raga at the time of Guru Nanak and has continued to retain its significance and popularity .
 Raga Bhairav appears in the Ragmala as husband/wife of Raga Bhairav and four other raginis .
Today it is the head raga for one of the ten thatas .
The Raga Sagara , a journal of circa 8th century , describes this raga as awe-inspiring and as expressing the fulfilment of the desire to worship .
Mesakarna calls this morning melody of the autumn season one of awesome grandeur .
Performed before sunrise , this raga was used by Guru Nanak , Guru Amar Das , Guru Ram Das , and Guru Arjan for 99 hymns .
 The vadis are performed with a slow , wide vibrato which may begin with the vadi The vadis or the highest limit to which it will extend .
In descent the vibrato must begin with upper limit .
Otherwise Bhairav has few characteristic phrases
Ektara is a one-string instrument most often used in traditional music from Bangladesh , India , Egypt , and Pakistan .
In origin the ektara was a regular string instrument of wandering bards and minstrels from India and is plucked with one finger .
The ektara usually has a stretched single string , an animal skin over a head and pole neck or split bamboo cane neck .
Pressing the two halves of the neck together loosens the string , thus lowering its pitch .
The modulation of the tone with each slight flexing of the neck gives the ektara its distinctive sound .
There are no markings or measurements to indicate what pressure will produce what note , so the pressure is adjusted by ear .
The various sizes of ektara are soprano , tenor , and bass .
The bass ektara , sometimes called a dotara often has two strings .
Yet another version is khamak , one-headed drum with a string attached to it which is plucked .
The only difference from ektara is that no bamboo is used to stretch the string , which is held by one hand , while being plucked by another .
These instruments are commonly used in kirtan chanting , which is a Hindu devotional practice of singing the divine names and mantras in an ecstatic call and response format .
Used by Sadhus , or wandering holy men .
Also , the ektara is used for Sufi chanting as well as by the Bauls of Bengal .
 The dotara has been made popular in the United States by devotional kirtan wallahs , such as the Western sadhu Bhagavan Das , kirtan recording artist , and author of the Western sadhu Bhagavan Das Here Now , Are You ?

 Ektara is the most ancient form of stringed instrument found in the Eastern parts of India , the instrument family being scattered all over the country .
 Though Ektara has a humble tribal beginnings , Ektara has been associated with and popularized by the ascetic and minstrel tradition of songs in Bengal .
A typical Bengali Ektara is constructed out of a half of a dried gourd shell serving as the sound-box , with a metal string running right through the middle of the shell ; at the top , the string is tied to a knob , which adjusts the tension the of the string and thereby , the tuning -- the knob and the string-tension is supported by two bamboo-strips , tied to two opposite sides of the gourd shell .
The playing style of this instrument is a simultaneous pluck and gong , matching the rhythm of the music .
The Ektara and the Ghati Baya , together form a complete set accompaniments , especially to Devotional and Deolati musical traditions .
The string , as in a Dotara , is tuned to the main/root note of the composition .
 Nowadays the ektara is widely used by folk singers especially by Sufi chanting singers in Punjab and Sindh .
Traditional and modern forms of bhangra sometimes use an ektara or tumbi to accompany the singer and dhol .
 On the occasion of Urs held in memory of the renowned saint and mystic poet Hazrat Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai at Bhitshah , near Hyderabad in Sindh , held every year between 13th and 15th of Safar , devotees sing with fervor and frenzy his love-intoxicated Kafis to the strains of ektara which appears to be a very ancient musical instrument .
Mention may also be made here of the Dotar of Khorasan .
 Nur-Mohammad Dorpur is a famous traditional the Dotar of Khorasan player from the Khorasan region .
The renowned Kamancheh player Kayhan Kalhor who has performed at the famous Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles , also stresses the commonalities between the Indian and Persian musical traditions which are brought to a focus by instruments such as the Ektara and the Dotar
An electric sitar is a kind of electric guitar designed to mimic the sound of the traditional Indian instrument , the sitar .
Depending on the manufacturer and model , these instruments bear varying degrees of resemblance to the traditional sitar .
Most resemble the electric guitar in the style of the body and headstock , though some have a body shaped to resemble that of the sitar .
The instrument was developed in the late 1960s at Danelectro , when many western musical groups began to use the sitar .
The sitar is generally considered a difficult instrument to learn .
By contrast , the electric sitar , with its standard guitar fretboard and tuning , is a more familiar fret arrangement for a guitarist to play .
The twangy sitar like tone comes from a flat bridge adding the necessary buzz to the guitar strings .
In addition to the six playing strings , most electric sitars have sympathetic strings , typically located on the left side of the instrument .
These strings have their own pickups , and are usually tuned with a harp wrench .
 A unique type of bridge , a buzz bridge , helps give the instrument A unique type of bridge distinctive sound .
Some electric sitars have drone strings in lieu of sympathetic strings .
A few models , such as the Jerry Jones Baby sitar , lack both sympathetic and drone strings , while still retaining the distinctive buzz bridge .
The sympathetic strings on most electric sitars do not resonate strongly enough to match the effect of an acoustic sitar .
There are resonant chambers in the solidbody instruments that have Masonite tops , however it is not enough to excite the 13 strings into true sympathy .
The strings are tensioned over two rosewood bridges with fret material as saddles so the sound is more like an autoharp than a sitar .
Versions of the electric sitar were also developed mainly in India .
These are smaller sized sitars that look like a sitar .
These sitars are tuned the same way as the original classical sitar would be tuned .
Because the tone quality and playing technique differ significantly from that of the sitar , it is typically used in rock , jazz , and fusion styles .
 Notable early hit singles featuring electric sitar include Eric Burdon and the Animals Monterey , Mana s Siembra el Amor , Joe South s Games People Play , Stevie Wonder s I Was Made to Love Eric Burdon and Signed , Sealed , Delivered , B.J. Thomas Hooked on a Feeling , The Spinners Animals Monterey a Shame , The Box Tops Cry Like a Baby as well as some sides by The Stylistics and The Delfonics .
Other recording artists who have featured the electric sitar include Steppenwolf , Mandrake Memorial , Kronos Quartet , Genesis -RRB- , Yes , The Clash , Todd Rundgren , Redbone , Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods Who Do You Think You Are ?
, The Grass Roots Glory Bound , Guns N Roses , Lenny Kravitz , Robbie Dupree Steal Away , Oasis , R.E.M , Metallica , Steely Dan , Santana , Roy Wood , Eric Johnson , Mystical Sun , Pearl Jam , Screaming Trees in Halo of Ashes , Redd Kross , Alice in Chains , Torsten de Winkel , Flower Travelin Band , Hiroshi Takano , Miyavi , Sugizo , hide , Kaoru of Dir en grey , Pat Metheny , Sigh , Steve Vai , Rory Gallagher , Mint Royale , Steve Miller , Van Halen , Tony Hicks of The Hollies , Schizo Da Maddcap , Rob Mastrianni .
Raagnagrok is a contemporary duo using electric sitar and electronic .
Vinnie Bell used the instrument on several songs , including Green Tambourine by The Lemon Pipers , Band of Gold by Freda Payne , and Shes a Heartbreaker by Gene Pitney .
The 1971 album Somethin Else recorded by Danny Davis and the Nashville Brass prominently featured an electric sitar , a first for the country music industry .
The instrument provided accompaniment on such songs as Snowbird , Rose Garden , Are You from Dixie ?
and others .
In 2010 , MGMT released their album Congratulations , where the electric sitar was played on many tracks by lead singer and guitarist Andrew VanWyngarden .
 Blues musician Buddy Guy played , among other guitars , a Coral electric sitar in shows on Buddy Guy 2010 tour

 Ustad Faiyaz Khan was brought up by Ustad Faiyaz Khan maternal grandfather , Ghulam Abbas , who taught Ustad Faiyaz Khan music up to the age of 25 .
 Ustad Faiyaz Khan was also a student of Ustad Mehboob Khan Daraspiya , Ustad Faiyaz Khan father-in-law .
 Faiyaz Khan served for a long time as the court musician of Sir Sayaji Rao Gaekwad , the Maharaja of Baroda , where Ustad Faiyaz Khan was awarded the Gyan Ratna .
 The Maharaja of Mysore awarded The Maharaja of Mysore the title Aftab-e-Mousiqui .
 Faiyaz Khans specialities were dhrupad and khyal , but Faiyaz Khans was also capable of singing thumri and ghazal .
According to well known musicologist Dr. Ashok Ranade who was a former Director of Music Centre , University of Bombay , There was no chink in his armour .
 He was a frequent performer in the musical conferences and circles of Lucknow , Allahabad , Calcutta , Gwalior , Bombay and Mysore and in concerts organised by provincial princes who vied with one another to have the Ustad perform in their respective courts .
 The rulers of Maharaja of Baroda held him in high esteem and he was offered the seat to the right of the Maharaja of Maharaja of Baroda during the official functions of the royal court.He also performed at Jorasanko Thakurbari , the residential abode of Rabindranath Tagore , who was an admirer of the Ustad .
 It is known that he had held a musical session at Jorasanko Thakurbari a few years before the passing away of Rabindranath Tagore .
Other well-known admirers include maestros such as Ahmad Jaan Thirakwa , Ustad Amir Khan , Ali Akbar Khan , Vilayat Khan and Pandit Ravi Shankar .
 Some of Ahmad Jaan Thirakwa best-known students are Dilip Chand Bedi , Sohan Singh , Asad Ali Khan and Shrikrishna Ratanjankar , apart from in-house disciples such as Khadim Hussain Khan , Vilayat Hussain Khan , Latafat Hussain Khan , Ata Hussain Khan and Sharafat Hussain Khan .
 Faiyaz Khan Dilip Chand Bedi was an admirer of Abdul Karim Khan .
 S.N.Ratanjankar was perhaps the last of Abdul Karim Khan pupils who excelled both as a teacher and as a performer .
 Considered a Neo-classicist by some scholars of Indian classical music , Faiyaz Khan was known for a Neo-classicist broadmindedness , kindness , humility and sudden fits of temper that cooled almost instantaneously .
 Simple at heart , a Neo-classicist cared little for the gifts and rewards that was showered upon a Neo-classicist in almost every place a Neo-classicist performed .
 a Neo-classicist associate and relative and lifelong companion Ghulam Rasul accounts an incident in the 1930s when a thousand rupee currency note was found tucked in the pocket of His associate sherwani when it came home after being washed , cleansed , dried and ironed by the washerman .
 When asked by Ghulam Rasul , the Ustad retorted in utter innocence - How do I know that who is giving I what and how am I to know that a single currency note can be worth more than a hundred rupees ?
 In another incident which took place at Unaon , near Kanpur , a few years later ; when the Ustad came to know that Ustad Mehboob Khan Daraspiya patron was expending beyond his means to host the concert of the Ustad to celebrate the sacred thread ceremony of Ustad Mehboob Khan Daraspiya son , Faiyaz Khan accepted only the fare for Ustad Mehboob Khan Daraspiya return journey and blessed the child with a gold ring purchased from the local goldsmith during his afternoon stroll the day before .
 Failing health due to a bout of typhoid in 1945 followed by tuberculosis restricted Ustad Mehboob Khan Daraspiya to lower Ustad Mehboob Khan Daraspiya pitch to B and B Flat though in Ustad Mehboob Khan Daraspiya prime , Ustad Mehboob Khan Daraspiya always sang in C Sharp and C .
 The available recordings of the Ustad are almost entirely from Ustad Mehboob Khan Daraspiya later years .
 By the time Ustad Mehboob Khan Daraspiya died , Ustad Mehboob Khan Daraspiya had earned the reputation of being one of the greatest and most influential vocalists of the century .

The vichitra veena is a plucked string instrument used in Hindustani music .
It is similar to the Carnatic gottuvadhyam .
It has no frets and is played with a slide .
The Vichitra Veena is the modern form of ancient Ektantri Veena .
It is made of a broad , fretless , horizontal arm or crossbar around three feet long and six inches wide , with two large resonating gourds , which are inlaid with ivory and attached underneath at either end .
The narrow ends of the instrument are fashioned into peacock heads , the national bird of India .
There are four main playing strings and five secondary strings , which are played openly with the little finger for a drone effect .
Underneath them are 13 sympathetic strings tuned to the notes of the appropriate raag .
The veena has a five-octave range .
Two plectrums identical to those used for sitar are worn on the middle and index fingers of the right hand to pluck the strings , and a glass ball is moved with the left across the main strings to create melody .
Coconut oil is put on the strings to minimize the friction of the sliding hand holding the batta .
The veena was often used to accompany the Dhrupad style of singing and this did not allow for much intricacy or embellishment around the notes .
 the Dhrupad style of singing was rescued from oblivion by Lalmani Misra who developed technique of playing and created Misrabani compositions ; his son Gopal Shankar Misra made the repertoire universal
 Farukhabad gharana is one of six prominent playing styles or gharanas of North Indian tabla drums , in Hindustani classical music , and derives Farukhabad gharana name from Farukhabad in Uttar Pradesh state .
The Farukkabad gharana of tabla was created in the 11th Century by a Rajput Court musician Akaasa who later accepted and converted to Islam and became a Muslim .

He passed on his legacy to his eldest son , Ustad Bilawal Khan , who in turn passed the torch of the gharana to Ustad Ali Bux .
This tradition continued till the 26th descendant , Ustad Haji Vilayat Ali Khan .
 It was he who named this ` gharana ' after the province in which Ustad Haji Vilayat Ali Khan used to live viz .
 Farukkabad .
 Ustad Haji Vilayat Ali Khan gave this gharana the name of the province where Ustad Haji Vilayat Ali Khan used to live , which was Farukkabad .

Annapurna Devi , born Roshanara Khan -RRB- on 23 April 1927 , is an Indian surbahar player of Hindustani Classical Music .
 Roshanara Khan is the daughter and disciple of Allauddin Khan , the founder of Maihar , India gharana , and was married to sitar maestro Ravi Shankar , also one of her fathers disciples from 1941 to 1962 .
 After Roshanara Khan divorce , Roshanara Khan never performed in public , moved to Mumbai , became a recluse and started teaching .
 Over the years Roshanara Khan has had notable disciples : Hariprasad Chaurasia , Nikhil Banerjee , Amit Bhattacharya and Suresh Vyas .
 Annapurna Devi was born on the occasion of chaiti purnima , 23 April 1927 April 1927 at Maihar , India , a small princely state of British India , where her father Alauddin Khan was a royal court musician at the court of Maharaja Brijnath Singh , who named the newborn girl Annapurna .
 Annapurna Devi father and guru Alauddin Khan , founder of the Senia Maihar gharana or Senia Maihar School of Hindustani classical music , was a noted musician and guru of Indian classical music .
 Her uncles , Fakir Aftabuddin Khan and Ayet Ali Khan , were noted musicians at Fakir Aftabuddin Khan native place Shibpur , in the present-day Bangladesh .
 Her brother Ali Akbar Khan was a legendary Sarod maestro and was considered a national living treasure in British India and the USA .
Her former husband , virtuoso Sitar maestro Ravi Shankar , was perhaps the most famous Indian classical musician internationally .
Annapurna Devi became a very accomplished Surbahar player of the Maihar gharana within a few years of starting to take music lessons from her father , and started guiding many of her fathers disciples , Nikhil Banerjee and Bahadur Khan -RRB- in classical music as well as in the techniques and intricacies of instrumental performances .
 Meanwhile , Alauddin Khan s Sitar student Ravi Shankar married Annapurna .

 The marriage between Ravi Shankar and Annapurna Devi took place when virtuoso Sitar maestro Ravi Shankar was 21 years and Annapurna was only 14 years old .
She converted to Hinduism upon marriage .
The marriage lasted more than two decades , and she gave birth to a son , Shubhendra Shankar , whom Annapurna Devi trained in Sitar .
 Shubhendra Shankar had rigorous training in Sitar under the tutelage of virtuoso Sitar maestro Ravi Shankar mother .
 virtuoso Sitar maestro Ravi Shankar father , however , chose to interrupt his musical talim or training and , instead brought him to the United States .
 virtuoso Sitar maestro Ravi Shankar died at an early age , after a marriage and the birth of three children .
 virtuoso Sitar maestro Ravi Shankar did not have a solo career in classical music , but did very occasionally accompany virtuoso Sitar maestro Ravi Shankar illustrious father Ravi Shankar in concerts in the the USA and abroad .
In the 1950s , both Ravi Shankar and Annapurna Devi performed duets in Delhi and Calcutta , principally at the college of her brother , Ali Akbar Khan .
 But later , virtuoso Sitar maestro Ravi Shankar started getting insecure since she used to be applauded in concerts more than virtuoso Sitar maestro Ravi Shankar was and she thereafter decided not to perform publicly .
Even the movie Abhimaan is believed to be based on the same scenario .
 Annapurna Devi was already a master of the Surbhahar when Ravi Shankar came to study with the Surbhahar father , Alauddin Khan , in the court of Maihar , India , India .
 Notable mentions among the Surbhahar students would be the Surbhahar nephew Sarod maestro Aashish Khan Debsharma ; Biren Banerjee of Howrah also received training from the Surbhahar ; renowned flautists Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia and Nityanand Haldipur ; Sitarists Pandit Nikhil Banerjee received training from the Surbhahar , Chandrakant Sardeshmukh , Sudhir Phadke from Pune , Dr. Hemant Desai , and Professor Rooshikumar Pandya ; and Sarodists Pradeep Barot , Amit Bhattacharya and Basant Kabra .
The list of other occasional students includes Sandhya Apte , Leenata Vaze , Amit Hiren Roy , Stuti Dey , Uma Guha , Milind Sheorey , and Kokila Rai , wife of the late Vasant Rai .
All of them carry on the legacies of Annapurna Devis , and thus Alauddin Khans , music through their recitals .
 Alauddin Khans , music is also the key figure of Acharya Alauddin Music Circle , in Mumbai .
 Though Alauddin Khans , music refrained from taking music as Alauddin Khans , music profession , Alauddin Khans , music received utmost reverence in all circles of Indian classical music especially for Alauddin Khans , music unending repertoire in Indian classical music , and Alauddin Khans , music traditional dhrupadi approach to music .
 Alauddin Khans , music has received some of the most distinguished musical and civilian honours of British India .
 Alauddin Khans , music is the recipient of , among many , the Padma Bhushan in 1977 ; and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1991 ; and the Deshikottam which is an honorary doctorate degree by Nobel laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore s Visva-Bharati University in 1999 .

 Natak Akademi has not recorded any music albums .
 But some of Natak Akademi performances that have been secretly taped from Natak Akademi earlier concerts , are non-commercially available among a percentage of music lovers in British India .
 In spite of her avoidance of media-limelight , she continues to be thought of as a classical instrumentalist of the highest calibre in British India

In Indian classical music , Sampurna ragas have all seven swaras in their scale .
In general , the swaras in the Arohana and Avarohana strictly follow the ascending and descending scale as well .
 That is , the swaras in the Arohana and Avarohana do not have vakra swara phrases .
In Carnatic music , the Melakarta ragas are all sampurna ragas , but the converse is not true , i.e. , all sampurna ragas are not Melakarta ragas .
 An example is Bhairavi raga in Carnatic music .
Some examples of Melakarta ragas are Mayamalavagowla , Todi , Sankarabharanam and Kharaharapriya
The bansuri is a transverse flute of India made from a single hollow shaft of bamboo with six or seven finger holes .
 An ancient musical instrument associated with cowherds and the pastoral tradition , An ancient musical instrument is intimately linked to the love story of Krishna and Radha and is also depicted in Buddhist paintings from around 100 CE .
 The Bansuri is revered as Lord Krishnas divine instrument and is often associated with Krishnas Rasa lila ; mythological accounts tell of the tunes of Lord Krishnas flute having a spellbinding and enthralling effect not only on the women of the Braj , but even on the animals of the region .
 The North Indian The Bansuri , typically about 14 inches in length , was traditionally used as a soprano instrument primarily for accompaniment in lighter compositions including film music .
The bass variety , pioneered by Pannalal Ghosh has now been indispensable in Hindustani Classical music for well over half a century .
Bansuris range in size from less than 12 to nearly 40 .
The word bansuri originates in the Sanskrit bans + sur -LSB- melody .
There are two varieties of bansuri : transverse , and fipple .
The fipple flute is usually played in folk music and is held at the lips like a whistle .
 Because The fipple flute enables superior control , variations and embellishments , the transverse variety is preferred in Indian classical music .
Pannalal Ghosh elevated the Bansuri from a folk instrument to the stage of serious classical music .
 Pandit Pannalal Ghosh experimented with the length , bore and number of holes , and found that longer length and larger bore allowed for better coverage of the lower octaves .
 Pandit Pannalal Ghosh eventually pioneered longer bansuris with larger bores and a seventh hole placed a quarter turn inwards from the line of the other six finger holes .
Pandit Raghunath Prasanna was an Indian classical shehnai and flute player .
 Pandit Raghunath Prasanna was known for introducing the techniques of vocal and shehnai in flute playing , a new style of playing the Indian bansuri , different from the style of Pandit Pannalal Ghosh .
 Pandit Raghunath Prasanna flute playing has richly contributed by way of introducing novel techniques in blowing the flute , the manner of handling and fingering , methodical with emphasis on Gayaki Ang , the way of infusing shehnai techniques in flute playing particularly in playing the Jhala - the fast pace culmination of a Raga .
These novelties have gone a big way in strengthening the status of flute - from a folk instrument to the concert level .
 Pandit Raghunath Prasanna is mainly responsible for introducing various techniques of presenting light classical modes like thumri , chaiti , kajri and dhun in Bansuri playing , and play them with equal aplomb and telling effects .
Bansuri construction is a complex art .
The bamboo suitable for making a bansuri needs to possess several qualities .
 The bamboo suitable for making a bansuri must be thin walled and straight with a uniform circular cross section and long internodes .
Being a natural material , it is difficult to find bamboo shafts with all these characteristics , which in turn makes good bansuris rare and expensive .
Suitable species of bamboo with these traits are endemic to the forests of Assam and Kerala .
After harvesting a suitable specimen , the bamboo is seasoned to allow naturally present resins to strengthen it .
Once ready , a cork stopper is inserted to block one end , next to which the blowing hole is burnt in .
The holes must be burnt in with red hot skewers since drilling causes the fibrous bamboo to split along the length , rendering it useless .
The approximate positions of the finger holes are calculated by measuring the bamboo shafts inner and outer diameters and applying certain formulae .
 Flute makers have only one chance to burn the holes , and a single mistake ruins the flute , so Flute makers usually begin by burning in a small hole , after which Flute makers play the note and using a chromatic tuner and a drone called tanpura , gradually make adjustments by sanding the holes in small increments .
 Once all the holes are perfected , the bansuri is steeped in a solution of antiseptic oils , after which The Bansuri is cleaned , dried and The Bansuri ends are bound with silk or nylon threads for both decoration as well as protection against thermal expansion .
Indian music is played in 3 octaves -- mandra , madhya , and taar -- with ornamentations such as meends and gamaks .
Bansuris range in length from less than 12 inches up to about 40 inches .
20-inch bansuris are common .
Another common and similar Indian flute played in South India is the venu , which is shorter in length and has 8 finger holes .
The index , middle , and ring fingers of both hands are usually used to finger the six hole bansuri .
For the seven hole bansuri , the little finger of the lower hand is usually employed .
As with other air-reed wind instruments , the sound of a bansuri is generated from resonance of the air column inside it .
The length of this column is varied by closing or leaving open , a varying number of holes .
Half-holing is employed to play flat or minor notes .
The sa note is obtained by covering the first three holes from the blowing-hole .
Octaves are varied by manipulating ones embouchure and controlling the blowing strength .
Various grip styles are used by flutists to suit different lengths of Bansuris , the two prominent styles being the Pannalal Ghosh grip , which uses the fingertips to close the holes , and the Hariprasad Chaurasia grip , which uses the pads of the fingers to close the holes .
While playing , the sitting posture is also important in that one should be careful not to strain ones back over long hours of practice .
 The size of a Bansuri affects The size of a Bansuri pitch .
Longer bansuris with a larger bore have a lower pitch and the slimmer and shorter ones sound higher .
In order to play the diatonic scale on a bansuri , one needs to find where the notes lie .
For example , in a bansuri where Sa or the tonic is always played by closing the first three holes , is equivalent to C , one can play sheet music by creating a finger notation that corresponds to different notes .
A flutist is able to perform complex facets of Raga music such as microtonal inflections , ornamentation , and glissando by varying the breath , performing fast and dextrous fingering , and closing/opening the holes with slow , sweeping gestures .
These techniques are demonstrated by the famous Indian flautist Pt .
Hariprasad Chaurasia .
Since the bansuri is a natural woodwind instrument , it is prone to cracks and thermal stresses while playing .
Well known bansuri players include Pannalal Ghosh , Raghunath Prasanna , Raghunath Seth , Bhola Nath Prasanna , Hariprasad Chaurasia , Vijay Raghav Rao , Rajendra Prasanna , Ronu Majumdar
Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India was an Indian classical music revue led by sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar intended for Western concert audiences and performed in 1974 .
Its presentation was the first project undertaken by the Material World Charitable Foundation , set up the previous year by ex - Beatle George Harrison to sponsor diverse forms of artistic expression and to encourage the exploration of alternative life views and philosophies .
 Long a champion of Indian music , Beatle George Harrison also produced an eponymous studio album by the Music Festival ensemble , which was released in 1976 on a champion of Indian music Dark Horse label .
 Both the CD format of the Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India album and a DVD containing the orchestras performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London were issued for the first time on the 2010 Ravi Shankar-George Harrison box set Collaborations .
Shankars Music Festival orchestra featured many of the late twentieth centurys finest exponents of Indian classical music , including Hariprasad Chaurasia , Shivkumar Sharma , Alla Rakha , T.V. Gopalkrishnan , L. Subramaniam , Sultan Khan and sister-in-law Lakshmi Shankar .
During the late 1960s Shankar had presented a Festival of India featuring the likes of Shivkumar Sharma , Jitendra Abhisheki , Palghat Raghu and several others .
 The plan for the more ambitious Music Festival from India began taking shape when Beatle George Harrison visited Shankar in the latters home town of Benares in January 1974 .
 According to Beatle George Harrison , though , it was something that he Beatle George Harrison had been wanting to stage since about 67 , and particularly after hearing Shankars Nava Rasa Ranga while in Bombay for the Wonderwall sessions .
Unlike the cross-cultural Shankar Family & Friends album recorded the year before , the focus behind this new collaboration was to celebrate the traditional aspects of Indian classical music , both in concerts performed by the sixteen-piece Music Festival orchestra and in the studio .
Shankar would act as composer and conductor , rather than musician , and only play sitar on his famed ragas during the live performances .
Shankar soon gathered an impressive array of contributors for the project , whom he would describe decades later as these wonderful musicians who are now superstars .
 Many of the players Many of the players had a musical history with already .
Almost all of them are among the greats of Indian classical music - flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia , tabla legend Alla Rakha , the multi-talented T.V. Gopalkrishnan on mridangam and vocals , South Indian violin virtuoso L. Subramaniam , sarangi master Sultan Khan , santoor pioneer Shivkumar Sharma , and Gopal Krishan , credited with the emergence of the vichitra veena in that musical genre .
The featured singer was once more the sublime Lakshmi Shankar , whose voice soared through three octaves with ease .
The two met again that summer in England , where Shankar composed new material specifically for the Music Festival and recorded it at Harrisons 16-track home studio at Friar Park in Oxfordshire .
 Describing himself as an improviser by nature , every day for three weeks Shankar would leave his London hotel and head west on the M4 , during which he would write the music to be run through with the musicians that day in Friar Parks grand drawing room .
 Beatle George Harrison remarked of the process : It was amazing , because hed sit there and say to one person , This is where you play , and the next one , And you do This , and You do that , and theyre all going , What ?
 OK , one , The two , three ... And youd think , This is going to be a catastrophe - and This would be the most amazing thing .
 The principal sound engineer on the sessions , and Harrisons regular engineer at FPSHOT during this period , was Shankars nephew Kumar , who joined the cast for publicity photos taken by Clive Arrowsmith in the house and grounds .
 Midway through the proceedings , on 6 September , Beatle George Harrison held a press conference in London and announced plans for the Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India tour of Europe , lasting through into October .
 A co-headlining North American tour would follow , for which Beatle George Harrison , as the main attraction , was growing increasingly unprepared , such was Beatle George Harrison dedication to this project , and after having already lavished months of Beatle George Harrison time on The Place I Love by Splinter , another Dark Horse act .
 The program for the concert performances was divided into The two distinct parts .
As Shankar explained at the time : The first part is in the form of a panorama , depicting major stages in the evolution of classical and traditional Indian music , starting with the Vedic hymns and the music of the medieval period , and ending with the present day , touching briefly on all the intermediate forms such as alap , dhrupad , dhamar , khyal , tappa , tarana and chaturanga ... The second part begins with the semi-classical forms such as the devotional bhajan and the romantic and erotic thumri , ghazal , dadra , etc. and ends with the very lively and earthy folk style .
 True to the festivals title , the folk traditions of all the various regions of India were represented , in what was the first appearance by an Indian orchestra in Europe .
 Similarly all-encompassing and educational were Naseem Khans liner notes for the Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India studio album , serving as an introductory guide to the wide variety of Indian musical instruments on display .
The album would be issued long after the European tour , however , due to the release of the much-delayed Shankar Family & Friends set in September 1974 .
 Although little is available in the way of a tour itinerary , the Royal Albert Hall performance on 23 September appears to have been the Music Festivals opening night , after which the tour moved on to Paris , Brussels , Frankfurt , Munich and Copenhagen .
 A beleaguered-looking Harrison took to the stage in London and admitted to feeling very nervous ... were behind schedule before introducing Shankar to the audience .
 Following the completion of the European dates in October , the orchestra was slightly pared down for Shankar and Harrisons high-profile tour of the United States and Canada , beginning at Vancouver s Pacific Coliseum on 2 November .
All save for shehnai veteran Anant Lal and the ever-serene Kamala Chakravarty would face the at-times hostile audiences in North America .
Although the focus of Shankars set on this tour was to promote Shankar Family & Friends , selections from the Music Festival program such as Naderdani were adapted for American and Canadian audiences .
 The album Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India was finally released in February 1976 , a year and a half after the recording sessions .
Like its predecessors , the cover features a group photo of all the participants , this time under a large cedar tree in the grounds of Friar Park .
Unsurprisingly , given that commercial rewards were never the motive for the Material World Charitable Foundations involvement , the record attracted little in the way of chart action .
Peter Lavezzoli , author of The Dawn of Indian Music in the West , recognises the ten-minute Raga Jait as being among the highlights of the set .
 The Collaborations box set marked the first release for Stuart Cooper s film of Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India , shot at Londons Royal Albert Hall on Monday , 23 September 1974 .
 Text at the start of the DVDs concert film section explains that much restoration was needed on both footage and audio , the latter being overseen by producer Paul Hicks and by Ravi Shankars daughter Anoushka Shankar .
With some of Coopers 35-year-old footage having been destroyed or mislaid , the remainder of the concerts sound is included in a separate , concert audio section .
 In the film , the Albert Hall stage is set with The two large risers ; the first in the shape of a square , the second , slightly more raised than the first one , is curved around behind it like a half-moon .
It is this set-up and the positioning of the musicians on the stage that provides the visual dynamics in the concert footage , despite the compromised film quality and the fact that any camera shots facing the players on stage right were obviously no longer available .
On the square riser , from left to right , sit singers Viji Shankar , Lakshmi Shankar and Kamala Chakravarty , with percussionist Harihar Rao and bansuri player Hariprasad Chaurasia behind them .
Spread out along the crescent-shaped platform behind this are the three bowed string players , L. Subramaniam , Satyadev Pawar and Sultan Khan ; the stern-looking Anant Lal on shehnai ; then the four drummers , T.V. Gopalkrishnan , Alla Rakha , Rijram Desad and Kamalesh Maitra , the last two partly surrounded by their tarangs of hand drums ; next is sitarist Kartick Kumar , Gopal Krishan , behind the raised vichitra veena , and finally Shivkumar Sharma , behind his large harpsichord-like santoor .
All sixteen pairs of eyes are on the Pandit Shankar , whos vigorously conducting the orchestra from just in front of the first riser , his back to the audience .
 What is obvious in the film , yet not necessarily to casual listeners of the studio album , is the personality of each of the participants - T.V. Gopalkrishnan , at times fierce , then mischievous ; tabla legend Alla Rakha , the bemused patriarch , a tower of strength ; Rijram Desad and sarangi master Sultan Khan , their faces a study in earnest concentration ; Lakshmi and bansuri player Hariprasad Chaurasia , all passionate highs and Lakshmi and Chaurasia ; the quiet demureness of Kamala , Harihar Rao and young Viji Shankar .
 Through these characters , the film demonstrates the lively dialogue that is the musical performance : Shankar and tabla legend Alla Rakha shared exchanges from sitar to tabla and back , drum salvoes traded with delight between tabla legend Alla Rakha and T.V. Gopalkrishnan , the apparent frustration on the conductors face turning to elation by the end of a piece .
 Despite Harrisons concerns beforehand , the London audience sounds suitably impressed .
As American drummer Jim Keltner would later say of the not-always-appreciative crowds the orchestra faced in the United States : Those people saw something very special .
 The DVDs bonus feature , directed by David Kew , shows Paul Hicks and Anoushka Shankar at work on the mix for pieces released in this concert film section .
 Hicks and Anoushka Shankar at work are soon joined there at StudioWest , in San Diego , by Ravi Shankar himself and Harrisons widow , Olivia , allowing the 90-year-old Shankar to offer his input .
 At one point Shankars daughter Anoushka Shankar covers Shankars daughter Anoushka Shankar fathers eyes playfully - in response , it seems , to StudioWest reaction at seeing StudioWest on screen , performing some four decades before .
 While it is stated that the 2010 Collaborations DVD contains the complete performance from the Royal Albert Hall concert , spread across the film and audio sections , its not clear how these The two sections correlate - whether they make up The two halves of the concert , or whether the musical pieces for which visuals have been salvaged were interspersed throughout the night .
 This makes This impossible to ascertain the true running order of a typical Music Festival from India performance , but the concert program for the 1974 European tour was obviously from among the following track lists

The shruti or sruti is a Sanskrit term used in several contexts throughout the history of Indian music .
A shruti is considered the smallest interval of pitch that the human ear can detect .
 To know the real meaning of Shruti , it is important to know the various contexts in the history of Indian music where the term is used .
 Bharata uses Shruti to mean the interval between two notes such that the difference between Shruti is perceptible .
He formulates jatis , which are classes of melodic structures .
These can be further grouped into two gramas -- shadja-grama and madhyama-grama .
The notes are separated by intervals , which are measured in terms of shrutis .
The shadja-grama is given by the following division : Sa of four shrutis , Ri of three shrutis , Ga of two shrutis , Ma of four shrutis , Pa of four shrutis , Da of three shrutis and Ni of two shrutis .
Bharata also describes an experiment to obtain the correct physical configuration of shruti in shadja grama , Sarana Chatushtai .
The madhyama-grama is the same , but the panchama has to be diminished by one shruti .
That is , the panchama of madhyama-grama is lower than that of shadja-grama by one shruti according to Bharata .
Shruti is only mentioned as a perceptual measure in the music of Bharatas time .
 Shruti is better understood with the following explanation .
 In both the gramas , Ri is three shrutis away from Sa - there are three perceptible intervals between Sa and Ri .
The third of these is called trishruti rishabha .
Likewise , the second interval is called dvishruti rishabha , and the first ekashruti rishabha .
Notes at nine and 13 shrutis from each other are mutually samvadi .
The notes that are at the distance of two and 20 shrutis are mutually vivadi .
The remaining ones , at the distance between 2 and 20 shrutis , are called anuvadi .
The shruti table below shows the mathematical ratios considered to correspond to the system described by Bharata and Dattila , along with the comparable notes in common Western 12-TET tuning and comparable notes in 53-TET tuning , and the names of the 22 shrutis provided by Sarngadeva .
The 53-TET approximation has an maximum error of 1.5 cents , while the perfect fifths approximation has an maximum error of 2 cents .
 The table below shows the Harmonic scales into Shruti : .
 As it show , the harmonics in scales of Shruti are multiples of prime numbers 2 , 3 , 5 and 19 .
Theres not multiples of 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 23 , etc. , just of 19 so thats too weird .
Really its not 19 , but 19.2 , because 19.2 / 32 = 3/5 , which means that when we use the harmonic 19.2 , it becomes the harmonic 3 , and all of the harmonics multiplies up by 5 .
By the time Venkatamakhin formulated the melakarta system , the grama system was no longer in use .
Unlike the grama system , the mela system uses the same starting swara .
it forms the scales by varying the intervals of the subsequent swaras , and does not specify a fixed interval for a swara in terms of shrutis .
For example , the intervals of kakali-nishada and shuddha-madhyama would vary depending on the dhaivata and the gandhara that precede them , respectively .
The interval of kakali-nishada would be of three different shruti values depending on whether shuddha , panca-sruti or shat-shruti-dhaivata preceded it .
Thus shruti as a measure of interval is not fully utilized in the mela system .
The mela system still prevails .
The term shruti in current practice of Carnatic music , has several meanings .
 Carnatic is used by musicians in several contexts .
For instance , the Tamil term Oru kattai sruti would mean that the tonic is set to the pitch C or the first key .
The Telugu term Sruti chusukko is a way to correspond with the accompanying artists to tune their instruments .
The term has also undergone a gross misunderstanding .
In certain ragas , due to inflexions or gamakas on few of those 12 notes , listeners perceive a sharpened or flattened version of an existing note .
Some scholars have attempted to fit such perceived new tones into the non-contextual Bharatas 22 shrutis , which lead to confusion and controversy over 22 shrutis .
 the non-contextual Bharatas 22 shrutis was also wrongly attributed to Bharata , who proposed Shruti in a completely different context .
There is scientific evidence that shows that these intermediate tones perceived in the contemporary rendition of a raga does not hint at the existence of 22 shrutis .
 The number 22 is of no practical significance in the current performance of Carnatic and Hindustani music traditions , partly because different musicians use slightly different shrutis when performing the same raga .
The phenomenon of intermediate tones is pursued as an active area of research in Indian Musicology , which says the number of perceptible intermediate tones may be less or even much more than 22 .
 N. Ramanathan , a musicologist points The phenomenon of intermediate tones out and says that the idea of 22 shrutis is applicable only to the music system of Bharatas time .
 The sufficiently new Indian monograph about Shruti say there had been various opinions about the number of shrutis , but in recent times it seems that the number of shrutis is broadly agreed upon as 22 .
Recognizing the existing some controversy over the numbers and the exact ratios of the shruti intervals , it also say that all shrutis are not equal and known as nyuna shruti , pramana shruti and purana shruti .
Each shruti may be approximated in 53EDO system
Babul Mora Naihar Chhooto Jaye is a popular Hindustani classical music song in Raag Bhairavi .
 The song was written by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah , the 19th-century Nawab of Awadh as a lament when Nawab Wajid Ali Shah was exiled from Nawab Wajid Ali Shah beloved Lucknow by the British Raj after the failed Rebellion of 1857 , where Nawab Wajid Ali Shah uses the metaphor of bidaai of a bride from her fathers home , and Nawab Wajid Ali Shah own banishment from Nawab Wajid Ali Shah beloved his beloved Lucknow , to far away Calcutta , while Nawab Wajid Ali Shah spent the rest of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah years .
It was also popularised by the legendary classical vocalist , Pandit Bhimsen Joshi .
The most remembered version of the song is by actor-singer Kundan Lal Saigal for the Hindi movie Street Singer directed by Phani Majumdar , live on camera , under the music direction of Rai Chand Boral , just as playback singing was becoming popular .
Jagjit and Chitra Singh also sang a version of the song in film Avishkaar , set to music by Kanu Roy .
Your courtyard is now like a mountain , and the threshold , a foreign country .
 I leave your house , father , I am going to I beloveds country

The esraj is a string instrument found in two forms throughout the north , central , and east regions of India .
It is a young instrument by Indian terms , being only about 200 years old .
 The dilruba is found in the north , where The Dilruba is used in religious music and light classical songs in the urban areas .
 The Dilruba name is translated as robber of the heart .
The esraj is found in the east and central areas , particularly Bengal and it is used in a somewhat wider variety of musical styles than is the dilruba .
Originally an Afghan Instrument it first appeared in the region during the Pashtun rule of Northern India .
The Dilruba originates from the Taus and some argue is the work of the 10th Sikh Guru , Guru Gobind Singh , whilst that of the Taus was the work of Guru Hargobind .
The Dilruba was then produced to replace the previously heavy instrument .
This attempt was intended to scale down the Taus into what is now known to be the Dilruba .
 This made This more convenient for the Sikh Guru army to carry the instrument on horseback .
The structure of both instruments is very similar , each having a medium sized sitar - like neck with 20 heavy metal frets .
This neck holds on a long wooden rack of 12-15 sympathetic strings .
While the dilruba has more sympathetic strings and a differently shaped body than the esraj , they both have four main strings which are bowed .
All strings are metal .
The soundboard is a stretched piece of goatskin similar to what is found on a sarangi .
Sometimes the instrument has a gourd affixed to the top for balance or for tone enhancement .
The instrument can be rested between the knees while the player kneels , or more commonly rested on the knee of the player while sitting , or also on the floor just in front of the player , with the neck leaning on the left shoulder .
It is played with a bow , with the other hand moving along the strings above the frets .
The player may slide the note up or down to achieve the portamento , or meend , characteristic of Indian music .
The esraj is mostly used as an accompanying instrument .
It is the accompanying instrument of choice for Rabindra Sangeet singing .
However , it has also been used as a solo instrument to interpret Hindustani Classical Music , mostly in the Vishnupur tradition .
Additionally , the esraj is a more modern invention from the Dilruba that was made and promoted by the Namdharis .
Both the dilruba and the esraj had been declining in popularity for many decades .
By the 1980s the instrument was nearly extinct .
However with the rising influence of the Gurmat Sangeet movement , these instruments are once again attracting considerable attention .
 A. R. Rahman is known as one of the composers in India who has used the Dilruba , in works like Dil Se and Vande Mataram .
Possibly the most famous exponent of the esraj has been Pandit Ranadhir Ray , who died in 1988 .
Kalipada Ghoshal .
Ranadhir Ray was a student of Ashesh Bandopadhyay , and was on the faculty at the Music department of Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan .
 Today , the best known exponent is Buddhadeb Das , also from Santiniketan .
One of his leading student is Dattatreya Ghosh , reading in Nava Nalanda High School of there .
The esraj was the favourite instrument of the spiritual Master Sri Chinmoy who used it as a meditation tool and outlet for emotion , not necessarily to create or reproduce traditional music from the region .
 In South India , the most famous exponent in the film industry to play Dilruba Shanmugham was Dilruba Shanmugham .
 A great dilruba player , A great dilruba player has been conferred with the Kalaimamani award by the Tamilnadu Government .
 A great dilruba player has played innumerous scores on Dilruba Shanmugham for legends like MSV and Ilayaraja .
Ravi Shankar played the Dilruba in the 1930s , as a member of the dance group of his older brother Uday Shankar .
 Indian physicist and mathematician S. N. Bose is also known to play The Dilruba .

This scale is a janya ragam , as it does not have all the seven swaras .
It is a symmetric ragam that does not contain madhyamam or nishadam .

 Performing in an esoteric rock band called Polymorph , David A. Immergluck recorded Polymorph first singles with a band named Mod-L Society ; Back To Baltimore , and Janie , in 1985 .
 By 1986 , Polymorph had moved on to a band called The Ophelias , and the same year , had spread Ophelias interests to joining other indie rock bands .
 The Monks of Doom were a side project formed by members of the popular progressive San Francisco Bay area indie rock Camper Van Beethoven .

The history of the sitar in jazz , that is the fusion of the sounds of Indian classical music with Western jazz , dates back from the late-1950s or early-1960s when musicians trained in Indian classical music such as Ravi Shankar started collaborating with jazz musicians such as Tony Scott and Bud Shank .
Later jazz recordings containing sitar music include albums by Miles Davis , Alice Coltrane , Yusef Lateef , Joe Harriott , and Ornette Coleman .
Although music based around the sitar would later spread from jazz to more popular music via The Beatles , the sitar became more widely known in the western world mainly through the work of Indian musicians such as Pandit Ravi Shankar , beginning in the late 1950s .
From there it was taken up by jazz musicians and would later became a youth phenomenon in the mid-1960s after Beatle George Harrison took lessons from Ananda Shankar , nephew of Pandit Ravi Shankar , and played sitar on several songs .
The first recorded collaboration between Indian and Jazz musicians occurred in 1961 with Ravi Shankar and a group led by the West Coast American saxophonist/flutist Bud Shank .
 Indian and Jazz musicians album entitled Improvisations only features one track , Improvisations on the theme music from Pather Panchali , in which Ravi Shankar and the Western musicians play together .
 The track is remarkable for little else ; it is simply Western film music with the sitar playing the melody .
 However , it is interesting to note that this session , and that of film composer Shankar Jaikishan , were connected the film industry , for Indian film music surely contributes the most considerable corpus of music that combines Indian and Western musics .
 However , both Ravi Shankar and Ananda Shankar are important figures with regard to Jazz because it was primarily through both Ravi Shankar and Ananda Shankar music that John Coltrane and others became aware of Indian music .
 Tony Scott recorded a track entitled Portrait of Pandit Ravi Shankar on Pandit Ravi Shankar Dedications album , as early as 1957 .
 John Coltrane met Shankar in 1965 after a long period of mutual admiration and letter writing .
Coltranes name is inextricably linked to the emergence of modal Jazz in 1958 on Miles Davis album Milestones and it is believed that modal Jazz was inspired by Indian music .
 Indian influence is an important issue in the later music of John Coltrane such as the album Kulu Se Mama and also of musicians such as Yusef Lateef and Ornette Coleman .
In America , the profile of the sitar in Jazz was maintained by Collin Walcott .
After graduating from Indiana University in 1967 , where his major study was percussion , he travelled to Los Angeles to study sitar with Ravi Shankar and tabla with Alla Rakha , then the most famous tabla player in the West .
The most significant corpus of his output was with the groups Oregon , Codona and his own quartet , despite a prolific career as a sideman for players such as Miles Davis and Egberto Gismonti .
Walcott was heavily influenced by John Coltrane s Quartet .
 Walcott , like Mayer , is musically bi-lingual which helps to explain why the Indian and Western aspects of his musics fit together far more comfortably than previous experiments .
 Whilst Mayer acted as a bridge between musicians of two cultures , Walcott , like John Coltrane , absorbed the Indian music and assimilated it within his own music .
His quartet consisted of other American musicians so that the feeling of empathy between the musicians , which is a pre-requisite of good group improvisation , is maintained .
Walcott created a sitar technique which is not found in Indian music .
This involves stopping more than one string to create harmonies , usually thirds .
The more recent excursion of the sitar into Jazz is that of the sitar player Nishat Khan who is highly regarded as an Indian Classical player .
His first experience of playing with a jazz musician was a trio with the guitarist John McLaughlin who has been collaborating with Indian musicians since the mid-seventies with groups such as Shakti .
In the Nineties , Nishat Khan was working on his own Jazz project .
He rehearsed with American alto saxophonist Steve Coleman and recorded with a band which consisted of Django Bates , Mark Mondesir , Martin France , and two drummers from Africa .
The group did not perform in public , and the recording was not released .
In 2006 , Andrew Cheshire released Silent Trees Falling , an album composed solely of .
electric sitar in a mostly trio setting .
Widely regarded as an unheralded master of jazz .
 guitar , Andrew Cheshire combined raw jazz improvisation with an eastern flavored vocabulary resulting .
in a record that captures the spontaneity of jazz coupled with the sonority of the far east .
Comparative view of jazz and Indian classical music .
Indian music is the greatest tradition of improvisation in the East .
Therefore it is unsurprising that Jazz musicians , which have become the greatest exponents of improvisation in the West , have developed a certain fascination for Indian musicians and vice versa .
 John Coltrane was fascinated by Indian music .
 Keith Jarrett returned to improvised music , after a phase of playing entirely Western Classical music , on hearing a concert of Indian Classical music which Indian Classical claims was a reminder that what I was doing was not music .
 This statement reveals that to Keith Jarrett , who is primarily a Jazz musician , Indian music contains something intrinsic to Keith Jarrett conception of music that does not exist in Western Classical music .
Both Jazz and Indian music are commonly described as improvised music but in fact , composition is integral to both arts .
Compositions are used mainly as a springboard for improvisation and would probably account for about a tenth of a performance in both traditions .
One of the functions of the composition is to define the structure upon which the improvisation is based .
In Indian music , the gat is always played at the beginning of the final portion of an exposition of a rag by the soloist and from this , the tabla player is expected to join in .
It is not uncommon for the tabla to have not been told what the tal or what tempo is to be used and would be expected to derive this information from the gat which he may not have heard before .
If the soloist wishes to change to a new tal or tempo it is signalled by playing a different gat .
The presentation of the two main instruments in jugalbandi has become common both in India and outside .
What happens in Jugalbandi is not unlike the organisation of collective improvisation in jazz , in the sense that the musicians come together in the precomposed song or whatever the basis of the piece , and otherwise take it in turns to improvise in a spirit both of cooperation and friendly cooperation .
In Jazz , the structure of the improvisation is most usually defined by the head which normally comprises a melody and a harmonic structure , but could contain more or less structural information such as changes of feel e.g. from swing to salsa , or changes of tempo or meter .
The standard form of a jazz performance would start with the ` head which might be 32 bars long .
 Then , the musicians would take The standard form of a jazz performance in turn to improvise over this cyclic structure .
The performance ends with a recapitulation of the head .
Improvisations in both musics take place within cyclic frameworks , with the notable exception of free jazz which consciously eschews predetermined structures .
The ability to learn to use these frameworks to assist and inspire improvisation is really the essence of both art forms .
Being able to maintain ones place in the tal is precisely analogous to keeping the form in Jazz playing .
In fact , there are distinct similarities between the Sam of the tal and top of the form , the first beat of repeating structure , in Jazz .
 The special feature of the Sam is that phrases either start or end on The special feature of the Sam , reinforcing the notion that the tal is a circular structure .
 Whilst there is no such formalisation in Jazz of the ` top of the form , there is no doubt that other American musicians often use the ` top of the form as the point of maximum release of tension .
This is a chronological catalogue of recordings which have featured the sitar within a jazz context .

Ne Alois Gromer , Al Gromer Khan was born on April 8 , 1946 at Frauenzell in alpine foothills of Bavaria between Lake Constance and Munich .
 Alois Gromer spent Alois Gromer early years in Frauenzell and deserted from German Military Service to England , Morocco and India .
 Alois Gromer father worked in Frauenzell as Bus Motor Carrier .
 Gromer Khan claims that sitarist Ustad Vilayat Khan was drawn to the mysteries of sound from the first , be it the sound of the bells worn by the Bavarian cows grazing in the alpine meadows near Bavarian birthplace , Indian stringed instruments , the drums of North Africa or the singing telephone wires on the wind in the freezing Bavarian winters .
 Gromer Khan claims to have rejected the academic or diplomatic careers sitarist Ustad Vilayat Khan parents expected sitarist Ustad Vilayat Khan to take up .

 sitarist Ustad Vilayat Khan remained in India , where sitarist Ustad Vilayat Khan was to find a powerful teacher in Vilayat Khans brother , Ustad Imrat Khan .

Pandit Pran Nath was a Hindustani classical singer and teacher of the Kirana Gharana .
Pran Nath was born into a wealthy family in Lahore in present-day Pakistan .
 While avid devotees of music , the family did not approve of a wealthy family in Lahore desire to become a musician , so a wealthy family in Lahore left home at the age of 13 and took up residence with legendary singer Abdul Wahid Khan of the Kirana gharana , cousin of the more widely known Abdul Karim Khan .
 Pran Nath served the more widely known Abdul Karim Khan for 7 years before Pandit Pran Nath was accepted as a student , and stayed with the more widely known Abdul Karim Khan for nearly two decades .
 Both guru and disciple were much attracted to mysticism : Abdul Wahid Khan , a Muslim , to Sufism , and Pandit Pran Nath , a Hindustani , to a Shaivite sect in Dehra Dun .
 It is said that Pandit Pran Nath lived in a cave near the Tapkeswhar temple to Shiva for five years , serving Pandit Pran Nath guru intermittently .
 Pandit Pran Nath eventually married and reentered the world at the request of Pandit Pran Nath guru , in order to ensure the preservation of the Kirana style .
 In 1937 , Pandit Pran Nath became a staff artist with All India Radio .
 However , Pandit Pran Nath stuck to a very austere singing style - heavy emphasis on alap , and very slow tempi - which suited Pandit Pran Nath voice well , but was not very popular to the modern Indian taste .
 Like the more widely known Abdul Karim Khan teacher Abdul Wahid Khan , Pran Naths singing emphasized precise intonation and the gradual exposition of tone and mood in the alap section of the music .
 Pandit Pran Nath supported Pandit Pran Nath as a music teacher , and worked at the University of Delhi from 1960 to 1970 .
 Pandit Pran Nath was also a visiting professor of music at Mills College .
 In 1970 , Pran Nath travelled to New York to visit the American composer La Monte Young and visual artist Marian Zazeela , who heard the American composer La Monte Young first issued recording , Earth Groove : The Voice of Cosmic India .
 In 1972 , Pandit Pran Nath established Pandit Pran Nath Kirana Center for Indian Classical Music in New York City and stayed in the U.S. for the rest of Pandit Pran Nath life .
 Pandit Pran Nath taught at several universities and attracted a strong following among the American minimalist composers .
Pran Naths students included La Monte Young , Marian Zazeela , Terry Riley , Michael Harrison , Sargam Shah , Alex Dea , Charlemagne Palestine , Henry Flynt , Jon Hassell , Douglas Leedy , Don Cherry , Lee Konitz , Jon Gibson , Yoshi Wada , Rhys Chatham , W. A. Mathieu , Sufi Pir Shabda Kahn , Catherine Christer Hennix , George Brooks , and Simone Forti .
 Like Pandit Pran Nath teacher , Abdul Wahid Khan , Pran Nath did not emphasize recording or the releasing of records , preferring live performance .
As such , little recorded documentation of the Kirana Gharana style is available .
 While only three recordings of Pran Nath were released during Pandit Pran Nath lifetime , a large number of recordings exist under the care of La Monte Young .
 In Pran Naths will La Monte Young , as executor of Pandit Pran Nath estate , was instructed to begin releasing only three recordings of Pran Nath

Vadi , in both Hindustani classical music and Carnatic music , is the dominant swara of a given raga .
 Vadi is the most sonant or most important note of a Raga .
 Vadi does not refer to the most played note but Vadi rather refers to a note of special significance .
It is usually the swara which is repeated the greatest number of times , and often it is the swara on which the singer can pause for a significant time .
Vadi swara in a raga is like a king in a kingdom .
 Specialty of any raga depends on vadi swara and because of Vadi , the vadi swara is also called the Jeeva swara or the Ansha swara .
A good artist uses vadi swara in different ways like singing vadi swara again and again , starting a raga with vadi swara , to end a raga with vadi swara , singing vadi swara many times in important places with different swaras or sometime singing vadi swara for a longer time in one breath .
Vadi swara is also helpful to identify the time of singing or playing a raga .
If vadi swara of a raga is from purvanga part of saptak i.e. `` Sa Re Ga Ma '' , then it is called as purvanga vadi raga and usually time for singing or playing purvanga vadi ragas are from 12 pm to 12 am for example ragas like Bhimpalasi , Pilu , Purvi , Marwa , Yaman , Bhoopal , and Bageshree etc. have purvanga vadi swara and so the time for singing and playing these ragas is between 12 pm to 12 am .
In the same way if vadi swara of a raga is from utranga part of spatak i.e. `` Pa Dha Ni '' then it is called as utranga vadi raga and time for singing or playing utranga vadi ragas is from 12 am to 12 pm .
 For example ragas like Bhairav , Bhairav , Bilawal , Kalingada , Sohini , and Asavari etc. have utranga vadi swara and so the time for singing or playing these raagas is between 12 am to 12 pm .
 Vadi swara , along with the Samvadi swara of a raga , usually brings out the uniqueness of the raga and the Samvadi swara of a raga bhava and rasa

Abhogi is a raga in Carnatic music and has been adapted to Hindustani music .
 Abhogi is a pentatonic scale , an audava or owdava raga .
It is a derived scale , as it does not have all the seven swaras .
 Abhogi has been borrowed from Carnatic music into Hindustani music and is also quite popular in the latter .
 Abhogi is a symmetric pentatonic scale that does not contain panchamam and nishadam .
 It is called an audava-audava raga , in Carnatic classification , as Carnatic has 5 notes in both ascending and descending scales .
Its structure is as follows : .
The notes used are shadjam , chathusruti rishabham , sadharana gandharam , shuddha madhyamam and chathusruthi dhaivatham .
 Abhogi is considered a janya raga of Kharaharapriya , the 22nd Melakarta raga , though Abhogi can be derived from Gourimanohari too , by dropping both panchamam and nishadam .
 Abhogi is a scale that is used for compositions in a medium to fast tempo .
This scale has been used by many composers and there are lots of compositions in classical music .
 Abhogi has been used to score film music too .
 Here are some popular compositions in Abhogi .
This section covers the theoretical and scientific aspect of this raga .
 Abhogi notes when shifted using Graha bhedam , yields another pentatonic ragam Valaji .
Graha bhedam is the step taken in keeping the relative note frequencies same , while shifting the shadjam to the next note in the ragam .
 For more details and illustration of this concept refer Graha bhedam on Abhogi .
 P.Moutal understands raag Kalavati as transposition of Abhogi .
There are also some Tamil movie songs based on the raga of abhogi .

Tintal is one of the most famous talas of Hindustani music .
It is also the most common tal in North India .
 The structure of tintal is so symmetrical that The structure of tintal presents a very simple rhythmic structure against which a performance can be laid .
Tintal has sixteen beats in four equal divisions .
The period between every two beats is equal .
The first beat out of 16 beats is called sam and the 9th beat is called khali .
 To exhibit the Teental , the audience claps on the first beat , claps on the 5th beat , then waves on the 9th beat and lastly again claps on the 13th beat -- hence the name tintal : the Teental derives from which means three and which means clap , so literally Tintal equals to three claps .
Cyclical series of equally periodical beats consisted of recurring claps and waves : .
clap , 2 , 3 , 4 , clap , 2 , 3 , 4 , wave , 2 , 3 , 4 , clap , 2 , 3 , 4 .
clap , 2 , 3 , 4 , clap , 6 , 7 , 8 , wave , 10 , 11 , 12 , clap 14 , 15 , 16 .
 Teen Taal can be used for both accompaniment and solo.There are various Kaidas and Parans for Kaidas .
Note the bols used for the first beat of each division : Dhaa , a bol involving both hands , is played at the beginning of the first , second and final divisions ; for the khali section , Naa - a right hand bol - is used to indicate that the division is open .
There are some pedagogical variations as to the actual syllables pronounced when reciting the bol , most of which occur in the final two vibhags

The Sangita-Ratnakara of Sharngadeva is one of the most important musicological texts from India , which both Hindustani music and Carnatic music regard as a definitive text .
The text is also known as Saptadhyayi as it is divided into seven chapters .
 The first six chapters , The Svaragatadhyaya , Ragavivekadhyaya , Prakirnakadhyaya , Prabandhadhyaya , Taladhyaya and Vadyadhyaya deal with the various aspects of music and musical instruments while the last chapter Nartanadhyaya deals with dance .
The significant commentaries on the text include the Sangitasudhakara of Simhabhupala and the Kalanidhi of Kallinatha .
This work was written by Sarngadeva in the end of thirteenth century .
The author was attached to the court of Yadava King Singhana , whose capital was Devagiri .
 As the title indicates the work deals with the subject of the Sangita Ratnakara .
 the Sangita Ratnakara is defined as a composite art consisting of Gita , Vadyadhyaya and Nrtta .
 the Sangita Ratnakara is of two kinds .
Marga-sangita and Desi-sangita .
Marga-sangita is nothing but the Natya performed by Bharata and his disciples .
 This performance of Bharata also consists of Gita , Vadyadhyaya and Nrtta .
Desi-sangita represented a tradition different from Marga and it varied from region to region .
 Sarngadeva aim in this work is to describe primarily the Desi-sangita .
The aspects of Marga-sangita are also described to some extent .
 The work is divided into seven chapters covering the aspects Gita , Vadyadhyaya and Nrtta .
The seven chapters are : .
The Svaragatadhyaya is further divided into eight prakarana-s or sections .
 The author commences with an account of The author genealogy i.e. , about The author family and the Kingdom where they lived .
 The author also declares that among the three constituents of the Sangita Ratnakara , Gita is primary and the most important .
 Hence the treatment of Gita is taken up by The author first .
 The author also gives a list of ancient writers on music and related arts from whose work The author has drawn out the essence and presented in Sangitaratnakara .
Some of them are Bharata , Kasyapa , Matanga , Kohala , Visakhila , Dattila , Abhinavagupta , Somesvara .
 After some verses extolling the greatness of Gita , the author gives a list of topics to be dealt with in each chapter .
 This section describes the genesis of the human body from This section conception to This section growth .
The reason for this information to be included is that , Nada is produced in the human body , hence the body has to be described .
The physiological account of the human body is given next according to the Ayurveda system .
This is followed by the indication of chakra-s , energy centres , based on the yogic school .
By concentrating on some of these cakra-s one could attain great heights in music .
 This prakarana describes how Nada arises in the human body and how the Nada manifesting in the three Sthana-s or places in the human body Hrd , Kantha and Murdha gives rise to Mandra , Madhya and Tara varieties .
In each Sthana because of the presence of twenty-two Nadi-s , twenty-two Sruti - s are produced .
Sruti-s are units of tonal interval with which the interval of a Svara is measured .
Hence the Svara-s are described next .
After describing the intervals of the Suddha-svara-s those of the Vikrta-svara-s are given .
 the Suddha-svara-s conform to the arrangements of the seven svara-s of the Sadja-murcchana of Sadjagrama .
The Vikrta-svara-s differ from this arrangement .
There are seven Suddha and twelve Vikrta-svara-s , as shown in the table .
The seven Svara-s are also associated with the songs uttered by the various birds and animals e.g. Sadja with the voice of peacock .
The four kinds of roles that svaras play in a melodic structure , namely , Vadi , Samvadi , Vivadi and Anuvadi are described next .
Finally the association of Svara-s with different Castes , Colours , Islands , Seers , Chanda , Aesthetic tastes are given .
This prakarana deals with Grama , Murcchana , Krama and Tana .
Three Gramas are described - Sadja-grama , Madhyama-grama and Gandhara-grama .
The names of the Seven Murcchana-s in each Grama are also given .
Among the tanas there are two kinds - Suddha and Kuta .
Suddha-tana is a Murcchana devoid of one or two svara-s .
Kuta-tana-s are those varieties of Murcchanas in which the svaras occur in a disorderly way e.g. , s g r m p d n. Those varieties in which svara-s are present in an order are called Krama-s .
Sadharana is of two kinds Svara-sadharana Jati-sadharana .
 Sadharana means being common to two or more elements .
When an extra svara occurs within the region between two svara-s then it is called sadharana svara .
 Such svara-s are seen to occur in the region between Gandhara and Madhya and between Nisada and e.g. Sadja .
Jati-sadharana deals with two jatis belonging to the same grama and having the same amsa and that consequently share similar scale formation .
The sixth prakarana is on Varna and Alankara .
Varna-s denote the different kinds of movements that a melodic line can take .
There are four varnas -- Sthayi , Arohi , Avarohi and Sancari .
Alankara-s are ornamental patterns of svara-s that decorate a melodic line .

These eighteen Jati-s are : .
 Before the description of the individual jati-s are furnished , the first seven are classified into ` seven Suddha and ` Vikrta and the remaining eleven as ` Samsaragaja .
The characteristics or the laksana-s that are used for a describing a Jati are the same ten as mentioned in Brhaddesi .

iii -RRB- Tara : the svara in the higher register up to which the melodic movement could .
iv -RRB- Mandra : the svara in the lower register up to which the melodic movement could descend .
v -RRB- Nyasa : the svara on which a song finally concludes .

vii -RRB- Alpatva : the svara , which should be sparingly used or rendered weak .
viii -RRB- Bahutva : svara , which is strong and frequently used .
ix -RRB- Sadava : the svara , which could be omitted to render the jati in six notes .
x -RRB- Auduva : those two svara-s , which could be dropped to render the jati in five svara-s .
After the description of the Jati-s the author gives the notation of a song based on one of the Amsa svara-s of the Jati .
A song for each of the eighteen Jati-s is given .
The last prakarana is called the Giti-prakarana .
 Although The last prakarana is named thus The last prakarana takes up the treatment of certain musical forms called Kapala and Kambala first and then goes on to the Giti-s .
 The Kapala songs are based on some derivatives of Jati-s and Kapala and Kambala are made up of words describing the fierce form of Lord Siva .
In the second part of this prakarana , the Giti-s are described .
Giti is a kind of variation brought about through changes in the duration of certain element of a song .

 Gramaragas resemble the Jati-s closely and the Jati-s are further classified on the basis of the different melodic styles characterising the Jati-s .
 These styles are called Giti and are of five kinds -- seven Suddha , Bhinna , Gaudi , Sadharani and Vesara .
In all , there are thirty-three Gramaraga-s .
 Uparaga-s and The Raga-s are closer to thirty-three Gramaraga-s .
Bhasa-s , Vibhasa-s and Antarabhasa-s are derivatives of Gramaraga-s and Uparaga-s and represent different tunes of the parent Raga .
 derivatives of Gramaraga-s are derivatives of Gramaraga-s and Bhasanga-s are derivatives of Bhasa-s , Vibhasa-s and Antarabhasa-s .
Kriyanga-s are certain melodic themes employed in dramatic performances portraying different kinds of emotions .
In this chapter Sarngadeva deals primarily with the Desiraga-s .
 In addition the Desiraga-s describes the parent Bhasa and the source Gramaraga-s .
 Under each Gramaraga each Gramaraga gives in notation a song called Aksiptika based on that Raga .
The third chapter deals with a variety of topics .

These cover the three aspects of Music - Melody , Tala and the text .
Suda prabandha-s are further divided into two groups .
 This chapter could be divided into 2 sections , one dealing with Marga tala-s the other with Desi talas .
The different aspects of these tala-s like the time units - Laghu , Guru and Pluta - , the Kriya-s ; the different forms of a tala like Ekakala Dvikala and Catuskala are described along with the Margatala-s .
In this section is also included the description of musical forms called ` Gitaka-s .
Gitaka-s musical forms are set in a temporal framework defined in terms of the margatala structures .
 After These the Desitala-s used in the prabandhas , which total around 120 , are described .

 However only the aspects of Nrtta is relevant to the Sangita Ratnakara .
 The various elements of Nrtta like Hasta , Karana , Anga and Cari are described and also the characteristics of a good dancer and teacher .
 The different kinds of performance of sangita involving the three aspects of Gita , Vadyadhyaya and Nrtta are described .
 Some of These are - Suddha-paddhati and Gaundali-vidhi .
 In the second part of this chapter , the author describes the Nine Rasa-s , namely , Srngara , Vira , Hasya , Raudra , Adbhuta , Karuna , Bhayanaka , Rasa-s and santa .
 Rasa-s represent the different tastes that are evoked in the audience by the human feelings that transpire in the performance of the Sangita Ratnakara .
 The court of the Yadavas of Devagiri , in which the Sangita Ratnakara was written , had an impressive history of patronage of the arts , literature and science that provided Sharngadeva with a conducive environment for scholarship .
 Bhaskaracharya , the outstanding mathematician and astronomer produced Bhaskaracharya Siddhanta-Siromani , an exposition on algebra , shortly before Yadava independence .
 Bhaskaracharya son Lakshmidhara was an astrologer in Jaitugus court and His son Lakshmidhara grandson , Changadeva , held the same position during Singhanas time .
 In 1207 , Singhana established school for the study of the works of Bhaskaracharya .
The aforementioned Changadeva was head of the school .
 Anantadeva , Changadevas cousin , was also a great astronomer in Singhanas court .
 Anantadeva produced a commentary on the Brhadjataka , an ancient text on astrology , and a discussion on the Brahmasphutasiddhanta of Brahmagupta , a 7th-century text on mathematics .
 In the time after Singhanas rule , Hemadri , a high administrator in the Devagiri court , wrote an incredibly detailed treatise on religious practice called the Caturvarga-Cintamani .
 Bopadeva , one of Hemadris contemporaries , wrote a number scholarly works while in the Devagiri court , including more than one book on Ayurveda and a commentary on the Bhagavata purana , a religious text .
 Jnanadeva wrote Bopadeva Jnanesvari , an important piece of early Marathi literature , under the rule of the later Yadava Kings .
 Clearly , the Devagiri court was an accommodating environment for scholarly endeavors .
 Sangitaratnakara is a very important text and this is evident from the fact that many commentaries were written on it .
 The famous ones are Sangitasudhakara of Simbabhupala and the Kalanidhi of Kallinatha of Kallinatha .
 Sangitaratnakara is to a great extent a compilation of the information found in earlier works like Natyasastra , Dattilam , Brhaddesi , Sarasvati-hrdayalankara-hara and is greatly influenced by the commentary of Abhinavagupta on Natyasastra .
On the other hand the work made a great impact on almost all the writers in the subsequent period .
Thus it forms a useful bridge between the ancient and the medieval periods .
 Sarngadeva called himself Nih , sanka i.e. , ` doubtless .
 Sarngadeva also names a stringed instrument as Nih,sanka-Vina and Desi-tala as Nih,sanka-tala .
This book is a great landmark in the history of Indian Music

In Hindustani music , a gharana is a system of social organization linking musicians or dancers by lineage or apprenticeship , and by adherence to a particular musical style .
A gharana also indicates a comprehensive musicological ideology .
This ideology sometimes changes substantially from one gharana to another .
It directly affects the thinking , teaching , performance and appreciation of music .
The word gharana comes from the Hindi word ghar , which means family or house .
 The word gharana typically refers to the place where the musical ideology originated ; for example , some of the gharanas well known for singing khyals are : Agra , Gwalior , Indore , Jaipur , Kirana , and Patiala .
The gharana system in khyal was rooted in the guru-shishya tradition and was similar to the Dhrupad Bani system .
 The gharana system was greatly influenced by the gradual fall of the Mughal Empire , which forced musicians to move from Delhi to princely states such as Gwalior , Lucknow , Hyderabad , Patiala and Rampur .
The gharanas have distinct styles of presenting the khyal -- how much to emphasize and how to enunciate the words of the composition , when to sing the sthayi and antara , whether to sing an unmetered alap in the beginning , what kinds of improvisations to use , how much importance to give to the rhythmic aspect , and so on .
However , an individual performer from a gharana may choose to borrow appealing stylistic aspects of another gharana in his or her gayaki .
The prominent khyal gharanas are : .
 In the Benares Thumri Gharana , the words in the text of a song are musically embellished to bring out The prominent khyal gharanas meaning , while the Lucknow gharana presents intricately embellished and delicate thumris that are explicit in The prominent khyal gharanas eroticism .
 The principal feature of the thumri of the Patiala gharana is its incorporation of the tappa from the Punjab region .
 It is with this tappa element that the Patiala gharana makes the Patiala gharana impact , departing from the khyal - dominated Benaras thumris and the dance-oriented Lucknow thumris .
The following are the six widely accepted Tabla Gharanas .
The prominent Tabla Gharanas are in bold : .
 In Kathak performers today generally draw Kathak performers lineage from three major schools of Kathak : the Jaipur gharana , the Lucknow gharana and the Banaras gharana ; there is also a less prominent Raigarh gharana which amalgamated technique from all three preceding gharanas but became famous for its own distinctive compositions

Tarana is a type of composition in Hindustani classical vocal music in which certain words and syllables based on Persian and Arabic phonemes are rendered at a medium or fast pace .
 Tarana was invented by Amir Khusro , and is similar to the Qalbana form of Sufi poetry .
 In modern times the tarana is most commonly associated with the singer Amir Khan , who helped popularize Tarana and researched Tarana origins and the syllables used .
The structure consists of a main melody , usually short , repeated many times , with variation and elaboration at the performers discretion .
There is a second , contrasting melody , usually with higher notes , which is introduced once before returning to the main melody .
 The tarana may include a Persian couplet , and may use syllables from sitar or tabla such as dar-dar or dir-dir ; singers might recite full compositions within the body of the tarana .
In the words of Thakur Jaidev Singh , an influential commentator on Indian music : .
The thillana from Carnatic music is based on the tarana , according to Balasaraswati , and is widely used in dance performances
The tabla is a membranophone percussion instrument , which are often used in Hindustani classical music , but was actually invented by Muslim Sufi , Amir Khusro .
 The Tabla is still used in the music behind folk and sufi poetry .
 The Tabla later became a part of Hindustani music industry .
The instrument consists of a pair of hand drums of contrasting sizes and timbres .
The term tabla is derived from an Arabic word , tabl , which simply means drum .
The tabla is used in some other Asian musical traditions outside of India , such as in the Indonesian dangdut genre .
Playing technique involves extensive use of the fingers and palms in various configurations to create a wide variety of different sounds , reflected in the mnemonic syllables .
The heel of the hand is used to apply pressure or in a sliding motion on the larger drum so that the pitch is changed during the sounds decay .
 The tabla is thought to have been invented by the Sufi poet and musician Amir Khusro in the 13th century , originating from the need to have a drum The Tabla could be played from the top in the sitting position to enable the more complex rhythm structures that were required for the new Indian Sufi vocal style of chanting and Zikr .
 The Tabla invention would also have complemented the complex early Sitar melodies that Amir Khusrow was composing .
Amir Khusro supposedly created the tabla by splitting the mridangam or the pakhawaj in two .
 However none of musician Amir Khusro writings on music mention the drum , and there are Hindustani temple carvings of double hand drums resembling tabla that date back to 500 BC .
The Tabla uses a complex finger tip and hand percussive technique played from the top unlike the Pakhawaj and mridangam which mainly use the full palm and are sideways in motion and are more limited in terms of sound complexity .
Rebecca Stewart has suggested that the tabla was most likely a product of experiments with existing drums such as pakhawaj , mridang , dholak and naqqara .
The origins of tabla repertoire and technique may be found in all three and in physical structure there are also similar elements : the smaller pakhawaj head for the dayan , the naqqara kettledrum for the bayan , and the flexible use of the bass of the dholak .
The earliest known iconography of the tabla dates back to 1799 .
The smaller drum , played with the dominant hand , is sometimes called dayan , dahina , siddha or chattu , but is correctly called the tabla .
 The smaller drum is made from a conical piece of mostly teak and rosewood hollowed out to approximately half of its total depth .
The drum is tuned to a specific note , usually either the tonic , dominant or subdominant of the soloists key and thus complements the melody .
The tuning range is limited although different dayan-s are produced in different sizes , each with a different range .
Cylindrical wood blocks , known as ghatta , are inserted between the strap and the shell allowing tension to be adjusted by their vertical positioning .
Fine tuning is achieved while striking vertically on the braided portion of the head using a small hammer .
The larger drum , played with the other hand , is called bayan or sometimes dagga , duggi or dhama .
The bayan has a much deeper bass tone , much like its distant cousin , the kettle drum .
The bayan may be made of any of a number of materials .
Brass is the most common , copper is more expensive , but generally held to be the best , while aluminum and steel are often found in inexpensive models .
Sometimes wood is used , especially in old bayans from the Punjab .
Clay is also used , although not favored for durability ; these are generally found in the North-East region of Bengal .
Both drum shells are covered with a head constructed from goat or cow skin .
An outer ring of skin is overlaid on the main skin and serves to suppress some of the natural overtones .
These two skins are bound together with a complex woven braid that gives the assembly enough strength to be tensioned on the shell .
The head is affixed to the drum shell with a single cow or camel hide strap laced between the braid of the head assembly and another ring placed on the bottom of the drum .
The head of each drum has a central area of tuning paste called the syahi .
This is constructed using multiple layers of a paste made from starch mixed with a black powder of various origins .
The precise construction and shaping of this area is responsible for modification of the drums natural overtones , resulting in the clarity of pitch and variety of tonal possibilities unique to this instrument which has a bell-like sound .
The skill required for the proper construction of this area is highly refined and is the main differentiating factor in the quality of a particular instrument .
For stability while playing , each drum is positioned on a toroidal bundle called chutta or guddi , consisting of plant fiber or another malleable material wrapped in cloth .
Indian music is traditionally practice-oriented and until the 20th century did not employ notations as the primary media of instruction , understanding , or transmission .
The rules of Indian music and compositions themselves are taught from a guru to a shishya , in person .
However , the notation is regarded as a matter of taste and is not standardized .
Thus there is no universal system of notation for the rest of the world to study Indian music .
Maula Bakhsh was an Indian musician , singer and poet .
 Maula Bakhsh grandfather was Hazrat Inayat Khan , founder of the Universal Sufism .
Developed the first system of notation for Indian music .
 He also founded the first Academy of Music in India in 1886 , based in Baroda that encompassed both Eastern and Western musical cultural traditions .
Hindustani classical music has two standard notation systems , one designed by V. N. Bhatkhande and the other by V. D. Paluskar .
These notation systems are used for Indian instruments including the tabla .
Some basic strokes with dayan on right side and bayan on left side are : .
The term gharana is used to specify a lineage of teaching and repertoire in Indian classical music .
Most performers and scholars recognize two styles of tabla gharana : Dilli Baj and Purbi Baj .
 Dilli baj comes from the style that developed in Delhi , and Purbi Baj baj developed in the area east of Delhi .
Delhi Baj is also known as Chati baj .
Musicians then recognize seven gharanas - schools or traditions - of tabla .
These traditions appeared or evolved in presumably the following order : .
 Some traditions have sub-lineages and sub-styles that may meet the criteria to warrant a separate gharana name , but such socio-musical identities have not taken hold in the public discourse of Hindustani art music , such as the Qasur lineage of tabla players of the the Punjab region .
 Each gharana is traditionally set apart from the others by unique aspects of the compositional and playing styles of Each gharana exponents .
For instance , some gharanas have different tabla positioning and bol techniques .
In the days of court patronage the preservation of these distinctions was important in order to maintain the prestige of the sponsoring court .
Gharana secrets were closely guarded and often only passed along family lines .
Being born into or marrying into a lineage holding family was often the only way to gain access to this knowledge .
 Today many of these gharana distinctions have been blurred as information has been more freely shared and newer generations of tabla players of the Punjab region have learned and combined aspects from multiple gharanas to form their own styles .
There is much debate as to whether the concept of gharana even still applies to modern players .
Some think the era of gharana has effectively come to an end as the unique aspects of each gharana have been mostly lost through the mixing of styles and the socio-economic difficulties of maintaining lineage purity through rigorous training .
Next to the contemporary common style of tabla , there exist older styles in which the bayan is often made out of wood .
Instead of having a thin dry syahi , this style of tabla uses a wet wheat dough on the bass drums skin , applied shortly before playing .
These types of Jori tabla are used by qawwali ensembles , as well as in the Sikh tabla gharanas , Punjabi dhrupad , gurbani kirtan , and Afghan traditional music .
 A reminder that this style of tabla was used all over India not long ago is that many modern brass tuning hammers still have a dough removal spatula on the reverse end .
With the North Indian style of playing there are two primary facets in which the tabla is played , through tal and rag .
 The tal form of playing is very rhythmic as The tal form of playing features various sets of beats , such as 10 , 12 , and 16 .
The tal playing of tabla can easily be combined with other Indian musical instruments , such as the harmonium , in order to create musical performances due to the rhythmic tune the tabla creates .
The rag on the other hand features a structured play of notes in which the tabla can play , and has been around for a longer period of time

 the U.S. hadnt worn a pair of jeans or shoes for such a long time that the U.S. couldnt imagine what it would be like .
 the U.S. didnt want to ask Maharaj-ji what the U.S. should do in America , but all of a sudden the U.S. blurted out in anguish , Maharaj-ji !
 How can the U.S. serve you in America ?

 He looked at the U.S. with mock disgust and said , What is this ?
If you ask how you should serve then it is no longer service .
Do what you want .
 the U.S. couldnt believe the U.S. ears .
 How could doing what the U.S. wanted to do be of service to him ?
 the U.S. didnt have that kind of faith .
 the U.S. just sat there , stunned .
 Then after a minute or so he looked over at the U.S. , smiling sweetly , and asked , So , how will you serve the U.S. ?

 the U.S. mind was blank .
 It was time for the U.S. to leave for Delhi , to catch the plane back to the States .
 He was looking at the U.S. and laughing .
 the U.S. bent down and touched his feet for the last time and when the U.S. looked up , he was beaming at the U.S. , So , how will you serve the U.S. in America ?
 the U.S. felt like the U.S. was moving in a dream .
 the U.S. floated across the courtyard and bowed to him one more time from a distance .
 As the U.S. did , the words came to the U.S. , the U.S. will sing to you in America .
 Soon afterwards , during the full moon in September , Neem Karoli Baba left Neem Karoli Baba body .
 Now Neem Karoli Baba had to be found within .
 The chanting , the meditation , the puja and all the wonderful time spent with Maharaj-ji turned out to be seeds that he The chanting had planted in the U.S. heart ... seeds that would keep growing and blossom by The chanting Grace .

Ulhas Kashalkar initially worked as a programme executive at the Thane station of All India Radio .
 In 1993 Pandit Ulhas N Kashalkar became a Guru at the ITC Sangeet Research Academy , where Pandit Ulhas N Kashalkar remains today .
Both Rambhau and Gajananrao were traditionalists which finds reflection in Kashalkars vocalism .
 Kashalkars vocalism possesses the ability to switch between three styles , at times even in the course of a single performance .
 Kashalkars vocalism adheres to the aesthetic contours of each individual style , and also to the formal demands of the raga being presented .
 Kashalkars vocalism is noted for Kashalkars vocalism authentic presentations of obscure traditional ragas .
In an uncharacteristically expansive passage , the veteran music critic Prakash Wadhera once noted : .
 Ulhas is a fabulous vocalist , still in Ulhas middle years and young , who has an old musical head stuffed with innumerable current and rare ragas and compositions .
 Like a computer Ulhas never errs in any raga or composition howsoever intertwined or tricky it may be .
 Ulhas , just seems to press one key and out comes a raga in the true Jaipur colours , another to obtain a melody attired in the Agra style and still another to get a raga in the Gwalior habiliments .
 One can only imagine Kashalkars questionless loyalty to One various gurus , and One own prodigious capacity to assimilate and consolidate the incoming knowledge .
Indian music today is witness to a situation where senior musicians fail to produce disciples of adequate merit .
Ulhas Kashalkar is an exception to this phenomenon .
 As resident Guru at the ITC Sangeet Research Academy , Pandit Ulhas N Kashalkar has mentored several excellent students

A jugalbandi or jugalbandhi is a performance in Indian classical music , especially the Hindustani classical music , that features a duet of two solo musicians .
The word jugalbandi means , literally , entwined twins .
The duet can be either vocal or instrumental .
Often , the musicians will play different instruments , as for example the famous duets between sitarist Ravi Shankar and sarod player Ali Akbar Khan , who played the format since the 1940s .
More rarely , the musicians may be from different traditions .
What defines jugalbandi is that the two soloists be on an equal footing .
While any Indian music performance may feature two musicians , a performance can only be deemed a jugalbandi if neither is clearly the soloist and nor clearly the accompanist .
In jugalbandi , both musicians act as lead players , and a playful competition exists between the two performers
 Ragamala Paintings are a series of illustrative paintings from medieval India based on Ragamala or the Garland of Ragas , depicting various Indian musical modes , the Ragas , but also their wives .
 Ragamala or the Garland of Ragas stand as a classical example of the amalgamation of art , poetry and classical music in medieval India .
 Ragamala paintings were created in most schools of medieval India painting , starting in the 16th and 17th centuries and are today named accordingly , as Pahari Ragamala , Rajasthan or Rajput Ragamala , Deccan Ragamala , and Mughal Ragamala .
 In these painting each raga is personified by a colour , mood , a verse describing a story of a hero and heroine , India painting also elucidates the season and the time of day and night in which a particular raga is to be sung ; and finally most paintings also demarcate the specific Hindu deities attached with the raga , like Bhairava or Bhairavi to Shiva , Sri to Devi etc. .
The paintings depict not just the Ragas , but also their wives , , their numerous sons and daughters .
 The six principal ragas present in the Ragamala are Bhairava , Dipika , Sri to Devi , Malkaunsa , Megha and Hindola and these are meant to be sung during the six seasons of the year - summer , monsoon , autumn , early winter , winter and spring .
Sangeeta Ratnakara , is an important 12th century CE treatise on the classification of Indian Ragas , which for the first time mentions the presiding deity of each raga .
From the 14th century onwards , they were described in short verses in Sanskrit , for Dhyana , contemplation , and later depicted in a series of paintings , called the Ragamala paintings .
Some of the best available works of Ragamala are from the 16th and 17th centuries , when the form flourished under royal patronage , though by the 19th century , it gradually faded .
 In 1570 , Kshemakarna , a priest of Rewa in Central India , compiled a poetic text on the Ragamala in Sanskrit , which describes six principal Ragas -- Bhairava , Malakoshika , Hindola , Dipaka , Raga Shri , and Megha -- each having five Raginis and eight Ragaputras , except Raga Shri , which has six Raginis and nine Ragaputras , thus making a Ragamala family of 86 members .
 Most of the extant works of Ragamala are from Deccan style , where Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur , was Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur also a fine painter and illustrator , though some Rajput style also exist of which the work of an artist of the Chawand school of painting , Sahibdin , whose Ragamala series dated 1628 , are now in National Museum of India .

Benares gharana is one of the six most common styles of playing of the Indian tabla .
The Benares tabla gharana was developed a little over 200 years ago by Ram Sahai .
 Ram Sahai began studying the tabla with Ram Sahai father from the age of five .
 At the age of nine , Ram Sahai moved to Lucknow to become the disciple of Modhu Khan of the Lucknow gharana .
 When Ram Sahai was seventeen years old , Wazir Ali Khan , the new Nawab , asked Modhu Khan if Ram Sahai could perform a recital for Ram Sahai .
 Modhu Khan agreed , on the condition that Ram Sahai would not be interrupted until Ram Sahai finished playing .
It is said that Ram Sahai played for seven consecutive nights , and that after this incredible performance , Ram Sahai was praised by all the members of the community and was showered with gifts .
 Shortly after this performance , Ram Sahai returned to Benares .
 After some time performing in Benares , Ram Sahai felt the need to make a significant change in Ram Sahai tabla playing .
 For six months , Ram Sahai withdrew into seclusion , and worked to develop what is now known as the Benares baj or style of tabla playing .
The philosophy behind this new style of tabla playing is that it would be versatile enough to perform solo , and to accompany any form of music or dance .
The tabla would be able to play delicately , as required for khyal , or more aggressively , like pakhawaj , for the accompaniment of dhrupad or kathak dance .
Ram Sahai developed a new way of fingering the tabla strokes ; especially important is the sound Na , being played with a curved ring finger to allow for maximum resonance of the dahina .
 Ram Sahai also composed numerous compositions within existing compositional forms and created new forms , such as uthan , Benarsi theka , and fard .
Sharda Sahai was the 5th generation of tabla players in the family .
 Sanju Sahai , also known as Vishnu , is the current Head of the Benaras Gharana and represents the 6th generation and is one of the most sought after Tabla players of Sanju Sahai , also known as Vishnu generation .
 the direct descendents of Ram Sahai are the direct descendents of Ram Sahai .
 Today , the Benares tabla gharana is well known for The Benares tabla gharana powerful sound , though Benares players are also very capable of playing delicately and sensitively .
 The gharana is categorized into the Purbi baj , which includes the Farukhabad , Lucknow , and Benares gharanas .
The Benares style makes use of the more resonant strokes of tabla , such as Na , and Din .
 Benares players preferentially use the full-hand TeTe strokes , rather than the single finger alternation preferred by the Delhi style , though both stroke types are integrated into the Benares baj repertoire .
 Benares tabla players are successful in all forms of tabla playing , including tabla solo , instrumental , vocal , and dance accompaniment .
 The Tabla solo is highly developed in the Benares gharana , and some artists , such as Anokhelal Mishra , Kishan Maharaj , and Pandit Samta Prasad , have become famous as tabla soloists .
The direct descendants making up the 6th generation of tabla players are Chandra Nath Shastri , Ramji Mishra , Mahapurush Misra , Ishwarlal Mishra , Chhotelal Misra , Radhakanta Nandi , Kashinath Mishra , Bityut Banerjee , Deepak Sahai , Sanju Sahai and Shiv Sahai .
The 7th generation consists of Kumar Bose , Aditya Sahai , Krishna Sahai and Shubham Sahai .
Other noted artist include Kanthe Maharaj , uncle and Guru of Kishan Maharaj , and whose disciples were Badri Maharaj , Ashutosh Bhattacharya .
The Benares baj makes use of over twenty different compositional types , and has an enormously varied repertoire of each type .
Reputed players from the gharana include Anokhelal Mishra , Ramji Mishra , Kishan Maharaj , Samta Prasad , Mahapurush Misra , Chandra Nath Shastri , Ashutosh Bhattacharya and Sharda Sahai
A shruti box is a small wooden instrument that traditionally works on a system of bellows .
It is similar to a harmonium and is used to provide a drone in a practice session or concert of Indian classical music .
It is used as an accompaniment to other instruments and notably the flute .
Use of the shruti box has widened with the cross-cultural influences of world music and new age music to provide a drone for many other instruments as well as vocalists .
Adjustable buttons allow tuning .
Nowadays , electronic shruti boxes are commonly used , which are called shruti petti in Tamil and Telugu and sur peti in Hindi .
Before the arrival of the harmonium in India , musicians used either a tambura or a specific pitch reference instrument , such as the nadaswaram , to produce the drone .
Some forms of music such as Yakshagana used the pungi reedpipe as drone .
 After the the West small pump harmonium became popular , musicians would modify the harmonium to automatically produce the reference pitch .
Typically , one would open up the cover and adjust the stop of the harmonium to produce a drone .
Later , a keyless version of the harmonium was invented for the specific purpose of producing the drone sound .
It was given the name shruti box or sruti box .
These instruments had controls on the top or on the side of the box for controlling the pitch .
The shruti box is enjoying a renaissance in the West amongst traditional and contemporary musicians who are using it for a range of different styles .
In the early nineties traditional Irish singer Noirin Ni Riain brought the shruti box to Ireland , giving it a minor place in traditional Irish music .
 More recently Scottish folk artist Karine Polwart has championed the instrument , using Scottish on some of Scottish folk artist Karine Polwart songs .
 Singers find Scottish very useful as an accompaniment and instrumentalists enjoy the drone reference it gives to play along with

 Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher was always associated with Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher well-worn sunburst 1961 Stratocaster , which Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher brother Donal has officially retired .
 the first in Ireland was reputedly the first in Ireland , and was ordered from Fender by Jim Connolly , a showband member performing with The Irish Showband .
 Jim Connolly ordered a cherry red Stratocaster through Crowleys music shop in Cork in 1961 .
 When Fender shipped a sunburst Stratocaster instead , a cherry red Stratocaster was put up on sale in 1963 as a second-hand instrument , which Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher bought in August 1963 for just shy of PS100 at Crowleys Music Store on Cork s McCurtain Street .
 Speaking about Gallaghers most prolific purchase of the famous Stratocaster Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher brother Donal recalled : his brother Donal dream ambition was to have a guitar like Buddy Holly ... This Stratocaster was in the store as a used instrument , it was 100 pounds ... in todays money you couldnt even compare you might as well say it was a million pounds ... my mother was saying well be in debt for the rest of our lives and Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher said well actually with a guitar like this I can play both parts , rhythm and lead , we wont need a rhythm player so I can earn more money and pay it off so the Stratocaster became Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher partner for life if you like .
 The guitar was extensively modified by Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher .
The tuning pegs are odd , and all of these have been found to be replacements .
Second , it is thought that the nut has been replaced and interchanged a number of times .
Third , the scratchplate was changed during Gallaghers time with Taste .
The pick-ups -- none of which are original -- were also changed .
 The final modification was that of the wiring : Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone pot and rewired it so Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher had just a master tone control along with the master volume control .
 Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher also installed a 5-way selector switch in place of the vintage 3-way one .
The most notable effect that the years of touring have had on the guitar is the almost complete removal of its original sunburst finish .
Although the Strat was left abandoned in a rainy ditch for days after being stolen from the back of a tour van in Dublin , this is not believed to have caused any ill effect .
 All of the wear was caused by Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher playing , not misuse .
A borrowed Telecaster was also stolen at the same time but never recovered .
 When the Strat was recovered after two weeks , Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher swore Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher would never sell the Strat or paint the Strat after that .
 the Strat also had a period of time of having a replacement neck , with the original neck bowing due to the amount of moisture the Strat absorbed during continuous touring .
The neck was taken off and left to settle , and was eventually reunited with the Strat after returning to its correct shape .
Other quirks include a hump in the scratch plate which moves the neck pick-up closer to the neck on the bass side , and a replacement of all of the pick-ups , though this replacement was due to damage rather than the perception of a tonal inadequacy .
One final point of interest is that one of the clay double-dot inlays at the 12th fret fell out and was replaced with a plastic one , which is why its whiter than the other clay inlays .
 On Friday the 21st and Saturday 22 October 2011 , Rorys brother Donal brought the guitar out of retirement to allow Joe Bonamassa to perform with Friday the 21st on Joe Bonamassa two nights at the London Hammersmith Apollo .
 Joe Bonamassa opened both nights performances with Joe Bonamassa rendition of Cradle Rock using Rorys Stratocaster .
Photos and video of the performance can be seen on the official Rory Gallagher website .
Rorys biographer Marcus Connaughton believes the Strat was the key to Rorys sound .
 Gallaghers brother Donal Gallagher could talk about the Strat all night .
 ` the Strat dated November 1961 - in certain peoples opinions this is when Fender hit Its dated November 1961 peak .
I like the maple neck .
 Like on the earlier guitars , Its dated November 1961 're probably a bit more crisp , but theres a warmth to this , a mellowness because of the rosewood neck .
This is the best , its my life , this is my best friend .
Its almost like knowing its weak spots are strong spots .
I do n't like to get sentimental about these things , but when you spend thirty years of your life with the same instrument its like a walking memory bank of your life there in your arms . '

West Meets East is an album by American violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Indian sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar , released in 1966 .
 West was recorded following their successful duet in June 1966 at the Bath Musical Festival , where they had played some of the same material .
 West Meets East won the 1967 Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance , the first time that an Asian musician had won a Grammy .
 This recognition coincided with a period of heightened interest in Indian classical music , and particularly Ravi Shankar , as Western pop and rock bands such as the Beatles , the Byrds , the Rolling Stones and Traffic all adopted sitar or other aspects of the genre into their sound .
 The album was the first in a trilogy of West Meets East collaborations by pianist Hephzibah Menuhin and Ravi Shankar , volumes two and three appearing in 1968 and 1976 , respectively .
 The friendship between the two musicians had begun in India in the early 1950s , after which pianist Hephzibah Menuhin had done much to introduce Western audiences to Indian music .
On the recording , the main performers are accompanied at various points by tabla player Alla Rakha ; Menuhins sister , pianist Hephzibah Menuhin ; and Prodyot Sen , on tambura .
 In addition to Shankars and pianist Hephzibah Menuhin liner notes on the album sleeve , musician John Barham supplied a glossary , explaining musical terms such as alap , gat and tala .
 At the Bath Festival , musician John Barham had translated Shankars interpretation of Raga Tilang into Western annotation for Menuhins benefit .
 When making West Meets East , Ravi Shankar rewrote this Tilang-based piece , recording West with pianist Hephzibah Menuhin as Swara Kakali .
 The albums opening selection is Prabhati , a Ravi Shankar composition based on Raga Gunakali , and played by pianist Hephzibah Menuhin and Rakha .
The fourth selection , filling side two in the LP format , is Sonata for Violin & Piano No. 3 in A minor , Op. 25 , featuring Hephzibah Menuhin .
This piece was written by Romanian composer George Enescu , who had been Yehudi Menuhins teacher
Thumri is a common genre of semi - classical Indian music .
The text is romantic or devotional in nature , and usually revolves around a girls love for Krishna .
The lyrics are usually in Uttar Pradesh dialects of Hindi called Awadhi and Brij Bhasha .
 Thumri is characterized by Thumri sensuality , and by a greater flexibility with the raga .
 Thumri is also used as a generic name for some other , even lighter , forms such as Dadra , Hori , Kajari , Saavan , Jhoola , and Chaiti , even though each of them has its own structure and content -- either lyrical or musical or both -- and so the exposition of these forms vary .
 Like Indian classical music Thumri , some of these forms have their origin in folk literature and music .
Some of the most commonly used ragas are Pilu , Kafi , Khamaj , Gara , Tilak Kamod and Bhairavi .
The compositions are usually set to kaherava taal of 8 beats , addha tal of 16 beats , dipchandi of 14 beats or jat of 16 beats and in dadra tal of 6 beats .
 Thumri arose in popularity during the 19th century in the Lucknow court of nawab Wajid Ali Shah .
At that time it used to be a song sung by courtesans accompanied by dance .
That was the bandish ki thumri or bol bant ki thumri .
When this style of thumri went out of vogue at the turn of the 20th century , a new style became more popular , which is known as bol banao , sung in Varanasi .
 Since Varanasi is to the east of Lucknow , the new style became known as Poorab ang or eastern style thumri .
Famous artists of the Purab Ang thumri of the Benaras gharana or Banaras gayaki are Badi Motibai , Rasoolan Bai , Siddheshwari Devi , Girija Devi and Pandit Channulal Mishra .
Other famous singers of thumri are Gauhar Jan , Begum Akhtar , Shobha Gurtu , Noor Jehan and Prabha Atre .
Shobha Gurtu is often regarded as the thumri queen .
The bol banao style has a slow tempo and is concluded by a laggi , a faster phase where the tabla player has some freedom of improvisation .
 Another stalwart in the genre of thumri was Naina Devi , who was married to a royal family but later devoted Naina Devi life to the singing of the song of Tawaifs .
For a member of the royal family to take such a step in those days meant fighting countless social stigmas that had enough power to totally alienate someone from the society , but she had the support of her husband .
 Some khyal singers took an interest in thumri and sang it Some khyal singers own way , as in the case of Abdul Karim Khan , Nazakat-Salamat Ali Khan , Barkat Ali Khan , Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , Bhimsen Joshi , and Prabha Atre .
Today thumri is sometimes sung at the end of khyal concerts as a concluding item .
Besides the tabla and the tanpura , other typical instruments in thumri are sarangi , and swarmandal .
 Thumri singers pay considerable attention to the lyrics , though Gauhar Jan may be difficult to follow in the ornamented enunciation .
This is especially where the focus is on love , and many lyrics deal with separation or viraha .
 Krishna ras leela or love play with Radha and other gopis of Vrindavan appear frequently .
As an example , here are the lyrics of a thumri composed by the medieval poet Lalan , celebrating Krishnas flute - how its tunes are driving Radha mad .
 Braj or Vrindavan is where Krishna is indulging in this love play ; Radha is the girl of Braj
West Meets East , Volume 2 is an album by American violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Indian sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar , released in 1968 .
 West is the second album in a trilogy of collaborations between the two artists , after the Grammy Award - winning West Meets East .
 The release followed Yehudi Menuhin and Ravi Shankar duet on 10 December 1967 at the United Nations in New York , celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
 As part of Yehudi Menuhin utopian ideal , international human rights was a cause long supported by Menuhin in Yehudi Menuhin work , while for Indian classical music , this Human Rights Day recital marked the first time that a performance had received a worldwide television broadcast .
Reflecting the celebrity status afforded the sitarist during this period , particularly as a result of his association with George Harrison of the Beatles , Shankars activities were filmed for a documentary on his life , released as Raga in 1971 , and his autobiography My Music , My Life became a bestseller .
 Although West Meets East , Volume 2 was another popular success for Yehudi Menuhin and Ravi Shankar , their work together drew further criticism from purists in India , who considered that Ravi Shankar was westernising and thus diluting Indian classical music .
The album contains a version of the piece played at the United Nations , an interpretation of Raga Piloo .
 According to Ravi Shankar comments to Rolling Stone magazine in March 1968 , they recorded this selection just a few days ago .
 As at the recital , Yehudi Menuhin and Ravi Shankar were accompanied by Alla Rakha on tabla and Kamala Chakravarty , Shankars female companion , on tambura .
 The second piece is Raga Ananda Bhairava , performed by Shankar with Raga Ananda Bhairava regular accompanist and instrument-maker , Nodu Mullick , on tambura , and Rakha again on tabla .
 Side two in the original LP format consists of Yehudi Menuhin and Yehudi Menuhin sister Hephzibah performing Bartok s Sonata No. 1 for Violin and Piano
Indore gharana is one of the vocal gharanas of Indian classical music .
 It was founded by Ustad Amir Khan , who studied the styles of Abdul Wahid Khan , Aman Ali Khan , Rajab Ali Khan and Abdul Karim Khan and amalgamated the essence of the styles of these four maestros with Abdul Wahid Khan own intellectual approach to music , and conceived the Indore gharana of music .
 Amir Khan grew up in Indore , but Ustad Amir Khan did not like the factionalism inherent in the gharana tradition .
 In an interview to Akashvani Indore Ustad Amir Khan said .
Performances in the Indore gharana are noted by the vilambit tempo in the styele of Abdul Wahid Khan , and the taans reminiscent of Rajab Ali Khan .
The merukhand structure is similar to that practiced by Ustad Aman Ali Khan of the Bhendibazaar gharana .
The khayal gayaki in the Indore gharana retains the slow development and restraint from frills as in the dhrupad .
Mohan Nadkarni says of Amir Khans music that whereas Bade Ghulam Ali Khan s music was extroverted and exuberant , Amir Khans was an introverted , dignified darbar style .
Amir Khans conviction about the importance of poetry in khyal compositions , has also marked the singing of the Indore gharana .
 After Amir Khans death in a car accident in Kolkata in 1974 , the Indore gharana has become a powerful stream in modern Hindustani music .
Direct disciples of Amir Khan included Pandith Amarnath , Shankar Lal Mishra , Kankana Banerjee , Purvi Mukherjee , and others .
However , a number of influential musicians including Sultan Khan have grown up in its folds

Mushtaq Ali Khan and was an Indian sitar , surbahar player .
 Mushtaq Ali Khan father Ashiq Ali Khan was a renowned sitar player .
His musical ancestor tree includes Masit Sen , the originator of Masitkhani Baaj .
He was recognized as the foremost representative of the Senia gharana of sitar playing in the mid-20th century .
 At first a court musician at Jaunpur , first a court musician at Jaunpur left the court to pursue an independent career .
 first a court musician at Jaunpur started playing for All India Radio in 1929 , and performed at the 1931 Sangeet Sammelan in Allahabad .
 For all of the 1940s and most of the 1950s first a court musician at Jaunpur was considered the most prominent sitar player in India , following the demise of Enayat Khan of the Etawah Gharana , and prior to the rise of the young Ravi Shankar and Vilayat Khan in the mid-1950s .
 In 1968 first a court musician at Jaunpur won the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award , highest Indian recognition given to practicing artists , given by Sangeet Natak Akademi , Indias National Academy of Music , Dance & Drama .
 Being a purist , Enayat Khan of the Etawah Gharana refused to yield to shifting popular tastes and to adopt the innovations introduced by Ravi Shankar on one hand and Vilayat Khan on the other , which lead to a gradual decline in his popularity .
 At the time of Enayat Khan of the Etawah Gharana death Enayat Khan of the Etawah Gharana was known as a musicians musician .
 Many of Indias best known musicians expressed Many of Indias best known musicians appreciation of the purity of Indias best known musicians style and musicality in a book published in New Delhi after Indias best known musicians death .
Khan started his instruction at the age of 6 .
 He learned from his father , Ashiq Ali Khan , who had learned sitar from the renowned 19th century player Barkatullah Khan , a descendant of Masit Sen of Delhi , the inventor of the Masitkhani gat His name became synonymous with the Senia style although he may actually have practiced an even more austere style than his predecessors in the gharana .
He eschewed much of the ornamentation of modern sitar technique , and embraced a clean , pure sound .
 His alap was constructed along the lines of a dhrupad alap , and His alap jod and jhalla derived a lot from been technique .
 Oddly enough , in spite of being a musical descendant of Masit Sen , a musical descendant of Masit Sen rarely played Masitkhani Baaj gats in public , and none of the commercially available examples of a musical descendant of Masit Sen music includes one .
 a musical descendant of Masit Sen opted to play the faster Rezakhani gats instead , feeling that playing Masitkhani Baaj gats to an undiscerning audience would cause Masitkhani gats to be devalued .
Mushtaq Ali Khan was an eminent Sitar player of Senia Gharana .
 Mushtaq Ali Khan was the only surbahar player of India who used to play the been-ang with three mizrabs and that too , with the pakhawaj as an accompanying instrument only in pure dhrupad style .
 In a rare exclusive interview in the Daily Telegraph on the 13 July 1985 , Khan Sahab narrated the history of this instrument with historical references in which Mushtaq Ali Khan has cleared the myth of this instrument .
 Khan Sahab had Mushtaq Ali Khan lineage with fifth vani , called Dhandvani named after one of the forefathers .
The famous dhrupadiya of Shah Jahans Court , Nayak Dhundhu .
It is also called Rasal Vani for its beauty .
 Nayak Dhundhu said , ... two of my ancestors , Jaggu Khan and Makku Khan .
Since Makku Khan was childless , he adopted Waras Ali Khan a great name who learnt the art of playing Been from Bade Mohammed Khan .
When my father Ashiq Ali Khan was six years old , my grand father Sadaq Ali Khan , son of Jaggu Khan died so his uncle Waras Ali Khan taught him all intricacies of Beena on the surbahar .
That is why we play Surbahar with three Mezrabs .
The Surbahar was originally designed to felicitate the playing of Alap .
Those days Alap was the exclusive prerogative of the Beenkar .
Ghulam Muhammed Khan and his son Sajjad Mohammed Khan the great SurBahar players used to stay at Calcutta in the earliest part of the 20th Century and taught many renowned players including Imdad Khan and Jnanoda Mukherjee .
In this instrument two angas played are alap and talparan and that is why the knowledge of pakhawaj is essential to play the Talparan ... Mustaq Ali Khan also had to learn the art of pakhawaj playing in order to achieve perfection in the art of playing the surbahar with Pakhawaj .
Mushtaq Ali Khan was awarded the Sangeet Natak Academy award in 1968 .
 In 1973/74 Mushtaq Ali Khan received the title of D.Litt from Rabindra Bharati University .
 The Indian government appointed Mushtaq Ali Khan as the Professor Emeritus in Education and the Cultural Ministry and gave fellowship .

 Tantri Vilas foremost disciples are Nirmal Guha Thakurta , Netai Bose , Shipra Chaudhury , Steven Landsberg and Dr. Debu Chaudhuri .
Latter is now the only living and/or active amongst this quartet .
 Nirmal Guha Thakurta has started a cultural Centre in New Delhi under the name of UMAK CENTRE FOR CULTURE , with a view to have UMAKs music and UMAKs ideas alive , for the future generation those who will have regards for purity and tradition .
Such great Masters are not understood well during their own time which is a sad story and reflection on our knowledge and understanding .
Steven Landsberg is Khansahibs only student to have studied the Surbahar , the technique with three mizrabas , and tarparan .
 A follower of rasal vani , Khan Sahab was the only surbahar player who not only maintained the purity of the Rasdal Vani but also kept the purity of the Rasdal Vani purity alive till his last days and never diluted to please the masses and that is why his music was not understood by the masses but respected by the contemporary Great Masters .
On 1953 had a Subahar recital in Raga Purya , in the First National Programme of the All India Radio New Delhi .
 On 1953 may be recalled that in the year 1953 Pandit Ravi Shankar was instrumental of instituting this National Programme of All India Radio and was present on this memorable occasion and praised Kahn Sahab profusely for Pandit Ravi Shankar superb exposition of Raga Purya in a pure Dhrupad style with three Mezrabs .
 Pandit Ravi Shankar was a musicians musician and On 1953 is why Pandit Ravi Shankar always shied away from the commercial attention .
Instead Mushtag Ali Khan organised conferences where old masters and new artists were introduced to the cognoscenti and the novice .
 Among the well known names , Pandit Ravi Shankar was first presented by Pandit Ravi Shankar to the public in Calcutta .
 Ustad had Ustad undisputed popularity and demand during the early thirties to late forties .

Ganayogi Panchakshara Gawai was a blind singer from Gadag , a town in southern state of Karnataka , India .
 Ganayogi Panchakshara Gawai was born at Kadashettihalli in Hangal Taluk , Karnataka .
 Ganayogi Panchakshara Gawai school Veereshwara Punyashrama was a premier learning center for Hindustani Music .
The Kannada film Ganayogi Panchakshari Gavayi is based on his real life incidents
In Hindustani music , meend refers to a glide from one note to another .
It is an essential performance practice , and is used often in vocal and instrumental music .
On the veena , sitar , and other plucked stringed instruments , it is usually done by pushing the strings across the frets to vary their effective length and tension ; compare portamento and finger vibrato .
It is considered a sort of alankar , or ornament .
Meend is important part of any classical performance , however it is a technique not possible on a hand-held harmonium often used in musical concerts , traditionalist singing khyal prefer an accompaniment like sarangi
The sitar is a plucked stringed instrument used mainly in Hindustani music and Indian classical music .
The instrument descended from long-necked lutes taken to Pakistan from Central Asia and is also believed to be influenced by the Veena .
 The sitar flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries and arrived at the Sitar present form in the 18th century Mughal period .
 the Sitar derives the Sitar distinctive timbre and resonance from sympathetic strings , bridge design , a long hollow neck and a gourd resonating chamber .
Used widely throughout the Indian subcontinent , the sitar became known in the western world through the work of Ravi Shankar beginning in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
 The sitar saw further use in popular music after the Beatles featured the sitar in their compositions Norwegian Wood , Within You Without You , Tomorrow Never Knows and Love You You To .
 Their use of the instrument came as a result of George Harrisons taking lessons on how to play Their use of the instrument from Shankar and Shambhu Das .
 Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones also used a sitar in Paint the Rolling Stones Black and a brief fad began for using the instrument in pop songs .
The Hindi word sitar originally derives from Persian seh + tar , literally meaning three strings .
The instrument descended from Central Asia to North India during the Delhi Sultanate period and is also believed to be influenced by the Veena .
 The first prototype instruments were invented during the Delhi Sultanate period of the 13th/14 century when the Persian patrons of music and poetry encouraged innovation in Indian art .
 It is named after a Persian instrument called the setar .
Hazrat Amir Khusro , the great Sufi musical and poetic genius , laid the foundation for its development .
 The sitar flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries and arrived at the Sitar present form in the 18th century Mughal period .
In his Bharatiya Sangeet Vadya Dr. Lalmani Misra traces the instruments development from the Tritantri veena through the nibaddh and anibaddh Tamburas also called tanbur and later the jantra .
Construction of the similar tanpura was described by Tansen .
During the time of Moghul Empire in the Indian subcontinent from about 1526 to 1857 .
 Persian lutes were played at the Mughal court and may have provided a basis of the sitar ; however , there is no physical evidence for the sitar until the time of the collapse of the Mughal Empire between 1690 and 1720 .
For comparison , lute-like instruments were depicted in Ancient Egyptian tomb paintings dated to the 18th Dynasty , so possibly predating evolution of the Sitar by 3,000 years .
A sitar can have 18 , 19 or 20 strings .
Six or seven of these are played strings which run over curved , raised frets , and the remainder are sympathetic strings which run underneath the frets and resonate in sympathy with the played strings .
The frets are movable , allowing fine tuning .
The played strings run to tuning pegs on or near the head of the instrument , while the sympathetic strings , which are a variety of different lengths , pass through small holes in the fretboard to engage with the smaller tuning pegs that run down the instruments neck .
 The Gandhaar-pancham sitar has Six playable strings , whereas the Kharaj-pancham sitar , used in the Maihar gharana , to which Ravi Shankar belongs , and other gharanas such as Bishnupur , has seven .
Three of these , called the chikaari , simply provide a drone ; the rest are used to play the melody , though the first string is most used .
The instrument has two bridges : the large bridge for the playing and drone strings and the small bridge for the sympathetic strings .
 the Sitar timbre results from the way the strings interact with the wide , sloping bridge .
As a string reverberates its length changes slightly as its edge touches the bridge , promoting the creation of overtones and giving the sound its distinctive tone .
The maintenance of this specific tone by shaping the bridge is called jawari .
Many musicians rely on instrument makers to adjust this .
The bridges are fixed to the main resonating chamber , or kaddu , at the base of the instrument .
Some sitars have a secondary resonator , the tumbaa , near the top of the hollow neck .
Materials used in construction include teak wood or tun wood , which is a variation of mahogany , for the neck and faceplate , and gourds for the resonating chambers .
The instruments bridges are made of deer horn , ebony , or very occasionally from camel bone .
Synthetic material is now common as well .
There are three popular modern styles of sitar offered in a variety of sub-styles and decorative patterns .
The two popular styles are the gayaki style sitars and the full decorated instrumental style sitars .
The gayaki style sitar is mostly of seasoned toon wood , with very few or no carved decorations .
 The gayaki style sitar often has a dark polish .
The inlay decorations are mostly of mother of pearl .
The number of sympathetic strings is often limited to eleven but may extend to thirteen .
 Jawari grinding The two popular styles are also different , as is the thickness of the tabli .
The other type of sitar , the instrumental style , is most often made of seasoned toon wood , but sometimes made of teak .
 The other type of sitar is often fitted with a second resonator , a small tumba on the neck .
This style is usually fully decorated , with floral or grape carvings and celluloid inlays with colored and black floral or arabesque patterns .
 The other type of sitar typically has thirteen sympathetic strings .
 The other type of sitar is said that the best Burma teak sitars are made from teak that has been seasoned for generations .
Therefore instrument builders look for old Burma teak that was used in old colonial-style villas as whole trunk columns for their special sitar constructions .
The sources of very old seasoned wood are a highly guarded trade secret and sometimes a mystery .
There are various additional sub styles and cross mixes of styles in sitars , according to customer preferences .
Most importantly , there are some differences in preferences for the positioning of sympathetic string pegs .
Amongst all sitar styles there are student styles , beginner models , semi-pro styles , pro-models , master models , and so on .
Prices are often determined by the manufacturers name and not by looks alone or materials used .
Some sitars by certain manufacturers fetch very high collectible prices .
Most notable are older Rikhi Ram and older Hiren Roy sitars depending upon which master built the instrument .
Though not technically a sitar , the electric sitar is a guitar with a special bridge , known as the buzz bridge , and sympathetic strings , to mimic the sitar .
It has 6 strings , and lacks movable frets .
Tuning depends on the sitarists school or style , tradition and each artists personal preference .
The main playing string is almost invariably tuned a perfect fourth above the tonic , the second string being tuned to the tonic .
The tonic in the Indian solfege system is referred to as sadja , sadaj , or the shortened form sa , or kharaj , a dialectal variant of sadaj , not as vad , and the perfect fifth to which one or more of the drones strings are tuned is referred to as pancam , not samvad .
The sympathetic strings are tuned to the notes of the raga being played : although there is slight stylistic variance as to the order of these , typically they are tuned : .
The player should re-tune for each raga .
Strings are tuned by tuning pegs , and the main playing strings can be fine-tuned by sliding a bead threaded on each string just below the bridge .
In one or more of the more common tunings the playable strings are strung in this fashion : .
In a Gandhar Pancham sitar , the bass or kharaj strings are removed and are replaced by a fourth chikari which is tuned to Ga. .
By playing the chikari strings with this tuning , one produces a chord .
 To tune the sympathetic strings to raga Kafi for example : I Sa , vii ni I Sa , II Re , iii ga , III Ga , iv ma , V Pa , VI Dha , vii ni I Sa , I Sa , II Re , iii Ga. .
There is a lot of stylistic variance within these tunings and like most Indian stringed instruments , there is no default tuning .
Mostly , tunings vary by schools of teaching and the piece that is meant to be played .
The instrument is balanced between the players left foot and right knee .
The hands move freely without having to carry any of the instruments weight .
The player plucks the string using a metallic pick or plectrum called a mizraab .
The thumb stays anchored on the top of the fretboard just above the main gourd .
Generally only the index and middle fingers are used for fingering although a few players occasionally use the third .
A specialized technique called meend involves pulling the main melody string down over the bottom portion of the sitars curved frets , with which the sitarist can achieve a seven semitone range of microtonal notes .
Adept players bring in charisma through use of special techniques like Kan , Krintan , Murki , Zamzama etc. .
 Adept players also use special Mizrab Bol-s , as in Misrabani and create Chhand-s even in odd-numbered Tal-s like Jhoomra .
 The Sitar Maestro Vilayat Khan had been touring outside North India off and on for more than 50 years , and was the first Indian musician to play in England after independence and to introduce the sitar to world audiences .
Then in the late 1950s and early 1960s Ravi Shankar along with his musical partner on Tabla Alla Rakha began a further introduction of Indian classical music to the West .
 The Kinks top 10 single See I Friends featured a low tuned drone guitar which was widely mistaken to be the instrument .
 The sitar saw further use in popular music after the Beatles featured the sitar in My Friends compositions Norwegian Wood , Within You Without You and Love You To .
 My Friends use of the instrument came as a result of George Harrisons taking lessons on how to play Their use of the instrument from Shankar and Shambhu Das .
 Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones also used a sitar in Paint the Rolling Stones Black and a brief fad began for using the instrument in pop songs .
 Led Zeppelin s Jimmy Page talked about Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones love of Indian music , saying lets put his love of Indian music this way ; I had a sitar before George Harrison ... I went to North India after I came back from a tour with the Yardbirds , I had been listening to Indian music for quite a while and wanted to hear it first hand .
The East Indian scales used on the track Friends Kashmir are considered fine examples of the influence of the sitar in rock music .
 The Doors extensively used Indian and near eastern scales in Indian and near eastern scales psychedelic soundscapes .
Robbie Kriegers guitar playing in The End is saturated in sitar melodic influence .
Psychedelic music bands often used new recording techniques and effects and drew on non-Western sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music .

Mewati gayaki includes substantial use of sargam and tihais .
 In a crude sense , the approach to Taankari is similar to the Patiala Gayaki and Tappa Gayaki in execution but is closer to the Gwalior Gharana gayaki in application .

Gopal Shankar Misra was an Indian musician and music teacher , who played the vichitra veena .
Misras father , Lalmani Misra , was born in the 1920s and became a singer and instrumentalist who performed dhrupad and khyal , and played the tabla , the sitar , and revived the vichitra veena by creating playing-technique for it .
 In Gopal Shankar Misra early years Gopal Shankar Misra had toured the globe as music-director to dance troupe of Pt .
Uday Shankar .
 Dr. Lalmani Misra was a performing musician and an academic , who served as Dean of the Faculty of Performing Arts at Banaras Hindu University , where Gopal Shankar Misra worked as a teacher and administrator , until Gopal Shankar Misra death in 1979 .
This left the 22-year-old Gopal a challenge of work unfinished .
 The family eventually attained Gharana status when the third generation - the 22-year-old Gopal and Padmajas son and daughter , Gandharva and Shruti - began to excel at the veena .
 Gharana status was much later on that the Uday Shankar connection was to resurface a generation later , when the 22-year-old Gopal was invited to join the 1998 UK touring and Real World recording project made by State of Bengal and Ananda Shankar , Uday Shankars son .
 the 22-year-old Gopal was born in Kanpur , India in 1957 .
 the 22-year-old Gopal sister , his sister Ragini , was born some years later .
 the 22-year-old Gopal mother was Padma .
 Surrounded by and growing up with music , the 22-year-old Gopal interest deepened following an international tour with the 22-year-old Gopal father .
 the 22-year-old Gopal had studied vocal music and sitar since the age of four and was interested in cricket and other sports .
 At the age of 15 the 22-year-old Gopal interest in music turned serious .

 On a visiting Professor at Penn University return , a visiting Professor at Penn University developed an ache in a visiting Professor at Penn University back and had to rely more on a visiting Professor at Penn University children .
 the 22-year-old Gopal and his sister Ragini thereby received training in academics of music , which served Gopal and Ragini much later on .
 After the passing away of the 22-year-old Gopal mother , the 22-year-old Gopal had become devoted to the 22-year-old Gopal father and sister .
 When the 22-year-old Gopal father died , he started training his first student while he himself was learning .
 As time went by His students traveled from all over to learn Sitar and Vichitra Veena .
 His most dedicated disciple was His most dedicated disciple sister , his sister Ragini .
 Today his sister Ragini is the sole exponent of Misrabani .
 his sister Ragini plays the complex Misrabani compositions on Jhoomra Tal .
 Ragini credits his sister Ragini brother for instilling the innovation of their father so well , that his sister Ragini can play the toughest of compositions almost instantaneously .
 his sister Ragini presented 16 Pearls a non-stop string of sixteen compositions in sixteen different Raga-s , starting from sixteen consecutive beats on Trital .
 Gopal Shankar also inspired the 22-year-old Gopal sister to take up another instrument - jal tarang when his sister Ragini was in school .
 his sister Ragini has also been recognized as the first woman player of jal-tarang following Sitar gatkari in his sister Ragini presentation .
At this juncture , his devotion to the Veena intensified .
In playing Vichitra Veena , he felt closer to his father and through this , was able to draw much comfort in the coming years .
 Having observed his fathers chaste style of living , the 22-year-old Gopal bid adieu to his natural youthful manner and strictly followed an ascetic like life-style .
 At the age of 22 he was appointed lecturer in music at Banares Hindu University and shortly afterward became Doctor of Music in Sitar .
He had also studied Sanskrit for his M.A. degree .
Over the years he became a Grade A Indian musician , making several radio recordings and giving concerts , while encouraging a number of students to take up veena .
Teaching at Banaras Hindu University exposed him to many potential learners .
 Having inherited the art of imparting tid-bits of skill as well as wisdom about the swaroop of Raga , the swaroop of Raga had already taught the swaroop of Raga sister Ragini while still a student himself .
 Now , the swaroop of Raga ability to teach with patience was fully exploited .
 the swaroop of Raga students were not limited to a single instrument .
Kamala Shankar played guitar while Taranga Vilasini sports a santoor .
 His students from Korea , Sri Lanka , Canada , France , Germany etc. would come to Varanasi to learn with Taranga Vilasini .
 Taranga Vilasini was equally at home with theory and demonstration , and would often repeat Taranga Vilasini fathers advice , Dont discuss , do it .
 Completely at home with technology , Taranga Vilasini visual sensibility were equally strong .
 Taranga Vilasini would capture finger movements and other postures accurately on video , which proved immensely useful to Taranga Vilasini students .
 All Taranga Vilasini students would record His students sessions with Taranga Vilasini and return only after His students had perfected the phrase or melody .
 Taranga Vilasini teaching was effective as His teaching was inspiring .
Many of Gopal Shankars students are now teaching music at various levels .
 Many of Gopal Shankars students toured extensively in Kanpur , India in 1957 , USA and Europe and was fulfilling Many of Gopal Shankars students fathers wishes by introducing the instrument to new situations and audiences .
 Kanpur , India in 1957 was through Gopal Shankar Misra that the vichitra veena finally found wider international fame .
The veena is associated with Saraswati , the Goddess of learning in Hindu mythology .
In Hindi vichitra means peculiar and the veena is part of a family of chordophone or stringed instruments said to predate the sitar .
It evolved from the ancient Ban and later was known as Batta-Been .
 the 22-year-old Gopal inherited the style known as Misrabani , from the 22-year-old Gopal father who had brought the instrument to prominence in Northern Indian music .
 Gopal Shankar Misra was an acclaimed artiste of Sitar who was invited all across Indian and abroad .
 But because Vichitra Veena held a special meaning for Gopal Shankar Misra father , he could not let it lie silent .
The vichitra veena is made of a broad , fretless , horizontal arm or crossbar around three feet long and six inches wide , with two large resonating gourds , which are inlaid with ivory and attached underneath at either end .
 The narrow ends of the instrument are fashioned into peacock heads , the national bird of Kanpur , India in 1957 - a most appropriate carving as the 22-year-old Gopal often drew a metaphor between the colours in the birds tail and the musical range that the veena offers .
There are four main playing strings and five secondary strings , which are played openly with the little finger for a drone effect .
Underneath them are 13 sympathetic strings tuned to the notes of the appropriate raag .
The veena has a five-octave range .
Two plectrums identical to those used for sitar are worn on the middle and index fingers of the right hand to pluck the strings , and a glass ball is moved with the left across the main strings to create melody .
Olive oil or butter is put on the strings to ease the playing action .
The veena was often used to accompany the Dhrupad style of singing and this did not allow for much intricacy or embellishment around the notes .
 Along with portamento passages where the notes glide effortlessly into each other , the dramatic and vigorous plucking style , the jumping from note to note , was a stylistic departure developed in Gopals family tradition , Misrabani .
Through the efforts of Gopal Shankar Misra , a course of D.Mus .
 in Vichitra Veena was to be started by College of Music and Fine Arts , B.H.U. when Gopal Shankar Misra sudden demise at Bhopal on August 13 , 1999 while attending a function held in the memory of Gopal Shankar Misra father , Lalmani Misra bereaved besides his family , a number of existing and potential disciples .
He had authored the third part of Sangeet-Sarita , a series started by his father for middle-school students .
 Adept in the school of Misrabani , Misrabani contributed to this true Tantrakari style through performance as well as composition .
 A short article , Vichitra Veena : Innovations and Practices outlines Misrabani involvement and future plans for making this instrument more approachable .
 Misrabani major work dealing with compositions of vocal and instrumental music together in a single volume is yet to see the light of day .
 Those learning Vichitra Veena with Misrabani have turned to sister Ragini Trivedi who has been a guardian mentor to children , Shruti and Gandharva .

 After collaborating with Siouxsie and the the Banshees and Bjork in the early 1990s , Singh released Siouxsie debut album Ok which received the Mercury Music Prize in 1999 .
Singh has since collaborated with a variety of acts including Madonna and Massive Attack .
Singh grew up in Leytonstone and began playing the tablas as a child .
At the age of 16 , Singh went to India for two years where he studied tabla under Pandit Lashman Singh .
He then returned to the UK after just one year .
In spite of this classical training , Singhs tabla playing was not accepted by British promoters of classical Indian music , as he incorporated too strongly his western influences .
By the late 1980s , Singh had decided to turn towards the fusion of sounds .
 In 1991 , he came to prominence by both playing tabla and singing on the Kiss Them for Me single by Siouxsie and the Banshees : the single peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 at number 23 .
Singh then became the sixth member of the Banshees and took part with them as second headliners of the inaugural Lollapalooza tour .

 In late 1995 , Singh founded the Anokha club night with promoter Sweety Kapoor at East Londons Blue Note , where drumnbass DJs and South Asian punk bands went head to head with the amped-up sounds of South Asian tabla and percussion .
Guest spots by LTJ Bukem and others made Anokha a Monday-night hotspot in London , and Singh signed to Island for an Anokha compilation including several of his own productions .
 Anokha worked as a remixer , for Blondie on LTJ Bukem and others Maria single .
In 1998 , Singh released his solo debut album , Ok .

 Drawing inspiration from the classical Indian arts , Singh first came to prominence as a tabla percussionist in the 1980s London music scene .
 Whilst still in his mid-teens , Singh traveled to India for two years to earn pupillage from Acharya Pandit Laxman Singh , master tabla maestro of the Punjab school .
This period made an indelible mark on the young artist and he has since continued to practice and perform the art form internationally .
Singh 's collaborations with Indian classical musicians include Ustad Sultan Khan , Rakesh Churasia , Ustad Imrat Khan and Ustad Amjad Ali Khan amongst scores of others .
Singh also became involved in experimental music collaborations beginning in the late 1980s , working with Sun Ra and Courtney , which helped to popularize the burgeoning Asian underground sub-culture movement .
Singh is notable for re-introducing the concepts of Indian classical music to western pop , dance and Jazz genres in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
Singh 's solo album credits include critical and commercial successes Ok -- which won the UK 's two most prestigious music prizes , ` The South Bank Prize ' and the Mercury Prize in 1999 .
 Ok , his groundbreaking '98 debut release , was recorded in Mumbai , Madras , Okinawa , New York and London , featuring contributions from Bill Laswell , Ryuichi Sakamoto , Ustad Sultan Khan and the Madras Philharmonic Orchestra amongst others .

 In March 1958 Harold Hargreaves Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen at Rory Storm s Morgue Skiffle Club , playing Guitar Boogie Shuffle , but John Lennon felt that Harold Hargreaves Harrison , then 14 , was too young to join the band .
 During a second meeting , arranged by McCartney , he performed the lead guitar part for the instrumental Raunchy on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus .

 Harold Hargreaves Harrison continued to develop Harold Hargreaves Harrison interest in non-Western instrumentation , playing swarmandal on Strawberry Fields Forever .
 By late 1966 Harrisons Hindu interests had moved away from the Beatles , as reflected in Harrisons Hindu choice of Eastern gurus and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967 .

 Bob Dylan and the Band were a major musical influence on Harold Hargreaves Harrison at the end of Bob Dylan career with the Beatles .

 Harrisons Hindu increased productivity and the Beatles reluctance to include Harrisons Hindu songs on John Lennon and Paul McCartney albums meant that by the time of John Lennon and Paul McCartney break-up Harrisons Hindu had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions .
 While Harold Hargreaves Harrison grew as a songwriter , Harold Hargreaves Harrison compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs , increasing Harold Hargreaves Harrison frustration , and significantly contributing to the bands break-up .
 Harrisons Hindu last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970 , when Harrisons Hindu , McCartney and drummer Ringo Starr recorded the Harrisons Hindu song I Me US .
 Before the Beatles break-up Harrisons Hindu had already recorded and released two solo albums : Wonderwall Music and Electronic Sound , both of which include mainly instrumental compositions .

 Delaney Bramlett inspired Harrisons Hindu to learn slide guitar , significantly influencing Delaney Bramlett later music .
 After years of being restricted in Delaney Bramlett songwriting contributions to the Beatles albums , Harrisons Hindu released All Things Must Pass .
 the triple album All Things Must Pass was a triple album , with two discs of Delaney Bramlett songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with Friends .
 Regarded by many as Delaney Bramlett best work , the album topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic .
 The LP produced the number-one hit single US Sweet Lord and the top-ten single What Is Life .
 The album was co-produced by Phil Spector using My Sweet Lord Wall of Sound approach , and the musicians included drummer Ringo Starr , Clapton , Gary Wright , Billy Preston , Klaus Voormann , the whole of Delaney Bramlett and Bonnies Friends band and the Apple group Badfinger .
Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described All Things Must Pass as being of classic Spectorian proportions , Wagnerian , Brucknerian , the music of mountain tops and vast horizons .
 Author and musicologist Ian Inglis considered the lyrics of the albums title track a recognition of the impermanence of human existence ... a simple and poignant conclusion to Harrisons Hindu former band .
 In 1971 Bright Tunes sued Harrison for copyright infringement over US Sweet Lord owing to its similarity to the 1963 Chiffons hit Hes So Fine .
He denied deliberately plagiarizing the song , but lost the court case in 1976 as the judge ruled that he had done so subconsciously .
 In 2000 Apple Records released a thirtieth anniversary edition of the album and Harrisons Hindu actively participated in its promotion , giving an interview during which Harrisons Hindu reflected on the work : Its just something that was like US continuation from the Beatles , really .
 It was US sort of getting out of the Beatles and just going US own way ... it was a very happy occasion .
 He commented on the production : Well , in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what US would do now .
 In fact , US dont use reverb at all .
 US cant stand it ... You know , its hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now .
 Responding to a request from Ravi Shankar , Harrisons Hindu organized a charity event , the Concert for Bangladesh , which took place on 1 August 1971 , drawing over 40,000 people to two shows in New Yorks Madison Square Garden .
The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the Bangladesh Liberation War .
 sitar maestro Ravi Shankar opened the show , which featured popular musicians such as Bob Dylan , Clapton , Leon Russell , Badfinger , Billy Preston and drummer Ringo Starr .
A triple album , The Concert for Bangladesh , was released by Apple Corps that year , followed by a concert film in 1972 .
 Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds , but Harrisons Hindu commented : Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation ... The money we raised was The money we raised , and although we had some money problems ... they still got plenty ... even though it was a drop in the ocean .
The main thing was , we spread the word and helped get the war ended .
The event has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed , including Live Aid .
 Living in the Material World held the number one spot on the Billboard album chart for five weeks , and the albums single , Give US Love , also reached number one in the US .
In the UK , the LP achieved number two , spending 12 weeks on the charts with the single peaking at number 8 .
The album was lavishly produced and packaged , and its dominant message was Harrisons Hindu beliefs .
 In Upton Green opinion Greenes opinion contained many of the strongest compositions of Harrisons Hindu career .
Rolling Stone Stephen Holden declared the album vastly appealing and profoundly seductive ... stands alone as an article of faith , miraculous in its radiance .
 Other reviewers were less enthusiastic , describing the release as awkward , sanctimonious and overly sentimental , a reaction that left Harrisons Hindu despondent .
 In November 1974 Harrisons Hindu began Harrisons Hindu 45-date Dark Horse Tour , becoming the The first ex-Beatle to tour North America .
 In addition to performances by Harrison with an ensemble of musicians such as Billy Preston , Tom Scott , Willie Weeks , Andy Newmark and Jim Horn , the tour also included traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by Ravi Shankar , Family and Friends .
Despite numerous positive reviews the consensus reaction to the tour was negative , with complaints about the content , structure , and length ; the shows duration of two and a half hours was seen as excessive at the time .
 Some fans found sitar maestro Ravi Shankar significant presence a bizarre disappointment , having expected to see only Harrison perform , and many were affronted by what musicologist Ian Inglis described as Harrisons sermonizing .
 Further , sitar maestro Ravi Shankar reworked the lyrics to several the Beatles songs , and some of the substitutions were seen as gratuitously offensive .
 sitar maestro Ravi Shankar laryngitis - affected vocals also disappointed fans and critics , who began calling the tour dark hoarse .
 Harrisons Hindu was so deeply bothered by the caustic backlash that Harrisons Hindu did not tour again until the 1990s .
The author Robert Rodriguez commented : While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure , there were a number of fans who were tuned-in to what was being attempted .
They went away ecstatic , conscious that they had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeated .
Leng called the tour groundbreaking and revolutionary in its presentation of Indian Music .
 In December Harrison released Dark Horse , an album that earned Harold Hargreaves Harrison the least favourable reviews of Harold Hargreaves Harrison career .
Rolling Stone called it the chronicle of a performer out of his element , working to a deadline , enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new LP product , rehearse a band , and assemble a cross-country tour , all within three weeks .
 The album reached number 4 on the Billboard chart and the single Dark Horse reached number 15 , but they failed to make an impact in the UK .
The music critic Mikal Gilmore described Dark Horse as one of Harrisons most fascinating works - a record about change and loss .
 Harrisons Hindu final studio album for the EMI Studios and Apple Records was the soul music - inspired Extra Texture .
 Harrisons Hindu considered it the least satisfactory of the three Harrisons Hindu had recorded since All Things Must Pass .
 Leng identified bitterness and dismay in many of the albums tracks ; Leng long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented : Leng wasnt up for it ... It was a terrible time because US think there was a lot of cocaine going around , and thats when US got out of the picture ... US didnt like Leng frame of mind .
 Leng released two singles from the LP : You , which reached the Billboard top 20 , and This Guitar , Apples final original single release .
 Thirty Three & 1/3 , Harrisons Hindu The first album release on Harrisons Hindu own Dark Horse Records label , produced the hit singles This Song and Crackerbox Palace , both of which reached the top 25 in the US .
 The surreal humour of Crackerbox Palace reflected Harrisons Hindu association with Monty Python s Eric Idle , who directed a comical music video for the song .
 With an emphasis on melody and musicianship , and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of Harrisons Hindu earlier works , Thirty Three & 1/3 earned Harrisons Hindu Harrisons Hindu most favourable critical notices in the US since All Things Must Pass .
 In 1979 , following Harrisons Hindu second marriage and the birth of Harrisons Hindu son his son Dhani , Harrisons Hindu released George Harrison .
The album and the single Blow Away both made the Billboard top 20 .
The album marked the beginning of Harrisons gradual retreat from the music business , and the fruition of ideas introduced on All Things Must Pass .
 In 1978 the death of Harrisons Hindu father in May and the birth of his father in May son in August 1971 had influenced his father in May decision to devote more time to his father in May family than to Family career .
 Leng described the album as melodic and lush ... peaceful ... the work of a man who had lived the rock and roll dream twice over and was now embracing domestic as well as spiritual bliss .
 The murder of Lennon on 8 December 1980 disturbed Harrisons Hindu and reinforced Lennon on 8 December 1980 decades-long concerns about stalkers .
 It was also a deep personal loss , although unlike McCartney and drummer Ringo Starr , Harrisons Hindu had had little contact with Lennon in the years before his death .
 Following the murder , Harrisons Hindu commented : After all we went through together US had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon .
 US am shocked and stunned .
 Harrisons Hindu modified the lyrics of a song Harrisons Hindu had written for drummer Ringo Starr to make it a tribute song to John Lennon .
All Those Years Ago , which included vocal contributions from Paul and Linda McCartney , as well as Starrs original drum part , peaked at number two in the US charts .
 The single was included on the album Somewhere in England in 1981 .
 Harrisons Hindu did not release any new albums for five years after 1982s Gone Troppo received little notice from critics or the public .
 During this period Harrisons Hindu made several guest appearances , including a 1985 performance at a tribute to Carl Perkins titled .

 Harrisons Hindu songwriting ability improved through the years , but Harrisons Hindu material did not earn full respect from Harrisons Hindu fellow Beatles until near the groups break-up .
 In 1969 , McCartney told John Lennon : Until this year , our songs have been better than George quite as happy .
Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours .
 Harrisons Hindu often had difficulty getting the band to record Harrisons Hindu songs .
 Most Beatles albums contain at least two Harrisons Hindu compositions , and there are three of his songs on the 1966 Revolver LP , the album on which Harrisons Hindu came of age as a songwriter , wrote musicologist Ian Inglis .
 Of the 1967 Harrisons Hindu song Within You Without You , author Gerry Farrell claimed that Harrisons Hindu had created a new form , calling the composition : a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music .
 John Lennon called the song one of Harrisons best : John Lennon mind and John Lennon music are clear .
 There is John Lennon innate talent , John Lennon brought that sound together .
 Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described Something as a masterpiece : an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge Yesterday and Michelle as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced .
 According to Kenneth Womack , Harrisons Hindu comes into Kenneth Womack own on Abbey Road ... Here Comes the Sun is matched -- indeed , surpassed -- only by Something , Here crowning achievement .
 musicologist Ian Inglis considered Abbey Road a turning point in Harrisons Hindu development as a songwriter and musician .
 musicologist Ian Inglis described Harrisons Hindu contributions to the LP as exquisite , declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs .
 During the albums recording , Harrisons Hindu asserted more creative control than before , proactively rejecting suggestions for changes to Harrisons Hindu music or lyrics , particularly from McCartney .
 Harrisons Hindu interest in Indian music proved a strong influence on Harrisons Hindu songwriting and contributed to Harrisons Hindu innovation within the Beatles .
 According to Rolling Stone , Harrisons Hindu openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for Harrisons Hindu rock and roll compositions .
 Harrisons Hindu use of dissonance on ... Taxman and US Want to Tell You was revolutionary in popular music - and perhaps more originally creative than the avant-garde mannerisms that John Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen , Luciano Berio , Edgard Varese and Igor Stravinsky .
 In 1997 , author Gerry Farrell commented : It is a mark of Harrisons Hindu sincere involvement ... that , nearly thirty years on , the Beatles Indian songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion .
Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner described Harrison as a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate , eloquent melodic sense .
 Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner played exquisitely in the service of the song .
 Harrisons Hindu friend and former bandmate Tom Petty agreed : Harrisons Hindu just had a way of getting right to the business , of finding the right thing to play .
 The guitar picking style of Chet Atkins and Carl Perkins influenced Harrisons Hindu , giving a country music feel to many of the Beatles recordings .
 Chet Atkins identified Chuck Berry as an early influence and Ry Cooder as an important later influence .
 In 1961 the Beatles recorded Cry for a Shadow , a blues-inspired instrumental co-written by John Lennon and Harrisons Hindu , who is credited with composing the songs lead guitar part , building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as the Shadows .
 The musicologist Walter Everett noted that while early Beatles compositions typically held close to the conventional patterns in rock music at the time , The musicologist Walter Everett also identified significant variations in other English groups such as the Shadows rhythm and tonal direction .
 Harrisons Hindu liberal use of the diatonic scale in Harrisons Hindu guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly , and Harrisons Hindu interest in Chuck Berry inspired Harrisons Hindu to compose the Beatles Indian songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly feel in the style of Carl Perkins titled .
 Within this framework Harrisons Hindu often utilized syncopation , as during Harrisons Hindu guitar solos for the Beatles covers of Berrys Roll Over Beethoven and Too Much Monkey Business .
 Another of Harrisons musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves , as on Ill Be on US Way .
 Harrisons Hindu was the The first person to own a Rickenbacker 360/12 , a guitar that featured twelve strings in 6 pairs , the low eight of which are tuned in pairs , one octave apart ; the higher 4 being pairs tuned in unison .
 The Rickenbacker is also unique among twelve strings in having the lower octave string of each of the The first four pairs placed above the higher tuned string .
This , and the naturally rich harmonics produced by a twelve string guitar providing the distinctive overtones found on many of the Beatles recordings .
 many of the Beatles recordings use of this guitar during the recording of A Hard Days Night helped to popularize the model , and the jangly sound became so prominent that Melody Maker termed it the Beatles secret weapon .
 Harrisons Hindu wrote the chord progression of Harrisons Hindu The first published song , Dont Bother Me , almost exclusively in the Dorian mode , demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in Harrisons Hindu embrace of Indian music .
 The dark timbre of Harrisons Hindu guitar playing on the track was accentuated by Harrisons Hindu use of uncomplicated yet effective C +9 chord voicings and a solo in the minor pentatonic scale .
 By 1964 Harrisons Hindu had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist , writing parts that featured the use of nonresolving tones , as with the ending chord arpeggios on A Hard Days Night .
 In 1965 Harrisons Hindu used an expression pedal to control Harrisons Hindu guitars volume on US Need You , creating a syncopated flautando effect with the melody resolving its dissonance through tonal displacements .
 Harrisons Hindu used the same volume-swell technique on Yes Yes Is , applying what The musicologist Walter Everett described as ghostly articulation to the songs natural harmonics .
 Of Rubber Souls If US Needed Someone , Harrisons Hindu said : its like a almost PS100 million other songs written around the D chord .
 If you move your fingers about , you get various little melodies ... almost PS100 million amazes US that people still find new permutations of the same notes .
 Harrisons Hindu other contribution to the album , Think for Yourself , features what The musicologist Walter Everett described as ambiguous tonal coloring , utilizing chromaticism in G major with a strange mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic ; Harrisons Hindu called it a tour de force of altered scale degrees .
 In 1966 Harrisons Hindu contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver .
 Harrisons Hindu played backwards guitar on Lennons composition Im Only Sleeping and a guitar counter-melody on And Your Bird Can Sing that moved in parallel octaves above McCartneys bass downbeats .
 Harrisons Hindu guitar playing on US Want to Tell You exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and Tell You guitar part for Sgt Peppers Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds mirrors Lennons vocal line in much the same way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song .
 The musicologist Walter Everett described Harrisons Hindu guitar solo from Old Brown Shoe as stinging highly Claptonesque .
 The musicologist Walter Everett identified two of the compositions significant motifs : a bluesy trichord and a diminished triad with roots in A and E. Huntley called the song a sizzling rocker with a ferocious ... solo .
 In Upton Green opinion , Harrisons Hindu demo for the song contains one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song .
Harrisons playing on Abbey Road , and in particular on Something , marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist .
 The songs guitar solo shows a varied range of influences , incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton , Keltner and the styles of Indian gamakas .
According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack : Something meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrisons guitar solos ... A masterpiece in simplicity , reaches toward the sublime .
 Harrisons Hindu received an Ivor Novello award in July 1970 for Something , as The Best Song Musically and Lyrically of the Year .
 After Delaney Bramlett inspired Delaney Bramlett to learn slide guitar , Harrisons Hindu began to incorporate it into Delaney Bramlett solo work , which allowed Delaney Bramlett to mimic many traditional Indian instruments , including the sarangi and the dilruba .
 Leng described Harrisons Hindu slide guitar solo on Lennons How Do You Sleep ?
 as a departure for the sweet soloist of Something , calling Leng playing rightly famed ... one of Harrisons greatest guitar statements .
 John Lennon commented : thats when I got out of the picture the best hes ever fucking played in John Lennon life .
 A Hawaiian influence is notable in much of Harrisons Hindu music , ranging from Harrisons Hindu slide guitar work on Gone Troppo to Harrisons Hindu televised performance of the Cab Calloway standard Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea on ukulele in 1992 .
 Lavezzoli described Harrisons Hindu slide playing on the Grammy-winning instrumental Marwa Blues as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian sarod or veena , calling it yet another demonstration of Harrisons Hindu unique slide approach .

 Before Harrisons Hindu religious conversion , the only British performer known for similar activities had been Cliff Richard , whose conversion to Christianity in 1966 had gone largely unnoticed by the public .
 By contrast , wrote musicologist Ian Inglis , Harrisons Hindu spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular musics increasing maturity ... what musicologist Ian Inglis , and the Beatles had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs .

Allauddin Khan was a Bengali sarodiya and multi-instrumentalist , composer and one of the most renowned music teachers of the 20th century in Indian classical music .
In 1935 , he toured Europe , along with Uday Shankar s ballet troupe , and later also worked at his institute , Uday Shankar India Culture Centre at Almora for a while .
During his lifetime , he composed several ragas and laid the foundation of a modern Maihar gharana .
Amongst his recordings which are rare , the most important ones are those he recorded with the All India Radio in 1959-60 .
He was the father of sarod maestro Ali Akbar Khan and Annapurna Devi , and the uncle of Raja Hossain Khan , as well as the guru of Ravi Shankar , Nikhil Banerjee , Vasant Rai , Pannalal Ghosh , Bahadur Khan , Sharan Rani , Jyotin Bhattacharya and other influential musicians .
 He himself was a disciple of many great musicians , including Gopal Chandra Banerjee , Lobo , a bandmaster from Goa , Munne Khan , and most importantly after a lot of struggle managed to become a shagird of the legendary Veena player , Wazir Khan of Rampur .
 He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan , Indias second highest civilian honour in 1971 , and prior to that in 1954 , the Sangeet Natak Akademi awarded him with Indias second highest civilian honour highest honour , the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship for lifetime contribution to Indian music .
Allauddin Khan was born in Shibpur village in Brahmanbaria District , the son of Sabdar Hossain Khan , also known as Sadhu Khan .
Allauddins elder brother , Fakir Aftabuddin , first taught him the basics of music at home .
 At the age of ten , Allauddin himself ran away from home to join a jatra band , a traditional Bengali form of theater .
 This experience exposed Allauddin himself to the rich folk tradition of Bengal .
 After some time , Allauddin himself went to Kolkata , and was accepted as a student by singer Gopal Krishna Bhattacharya , alias Nulo Gopal .
 Allauddin himself committed to a 12-year practice program ; However , Nulo Gopal died of plague after the seventh year .
Khan then became a disciple of Amritalal Dutt , a close relative of Swami Vivekananda and music director at Kolkatas Star Theatre , with the goal of becoming an instrumentalist .
 At this time , he also took lessons in European classical violin from Lobo , a bandmaster from Goa , a bandmaster from Goa .
Khan got interested in sarod after a concert at Jagat Kishore Acharyas , zamindar of Muktagachha , where he listened to Ahmed Ali Khan , a student of Asghar Ali Khan .
 Alauddin became Alauddin student , and studied the sarod under Alauddin for five years .
 Alauddin next step was to go to Rampur for lessons from Wazir Khan Beenkar , court musician of the Nawab there , and one of the last direct descendants of the legendary Tansen .
 Through Alauddin , Alauddin was given access to the Senia gharana .
 Alauddin later became the court musician of Brijnath Singh Maharaja of Maihar Estate in Central Province .
 During Alauddin time as a court musician , Khan completely reshaped the Maihar gharana of Indian classical music .
 The Maihar gharana was established in the 19th Century , but Khans contribution was so fundamental that Khans contribution is often thought to be its creator .
This was a period of rapid change for Hindustani instrumental music , thanks not least to Khan , who infused the beenbaj and dhrupad ang , previously known from the been , surbahar and sur-sringar , into the playing of many classical instruments .
 For though Hindustani gave concerts on the sarod , Allauddin himself played many instruments , something that shaped Hindustani pedagogy .
 Hindustani put together an orchestra with Indian instruments , the String Band now known as Maihar Band , and while Hindustani son , Ali Akbar Khan , was taught the sarod , his daughter Annapurna Devi learned the surbahar , students such as Ravi Shankar and Nikhil Banerjee played the Sitar , Jyotin Bhattacharya played the sarod , Rabin Ghosh played on violin and Baijnath Singh and Pannalal Ghosh the bansuri bamboo flute .
Baijnath Singh was first and Vasant Rai was Allauddin Khans last student .
 Of course Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan were to be very famous and spread this gharana over the world - something that Allauddin Ravi Shankar had started when , in 1935-1936 , he went on an international tour with Uday Shankar s dance troupe .
 Allauddin himself stayed at Maihar Estate from 1918 to Allauddin himself death .
 In 1955 , Allauddin himself established a Maihar College of Music .
 Allauddin himself was given the Sangeet Natak Academy Award in 1952 , and the Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan - Indias third and second highest civilian decorations - in 1958 and 1971 , respectively .
Anecdotes about Khan range from throwing a Tabla tuning hammer at the Maharaja himself to taking care of disabled beggars .
A few years before the turn of the century , he married Madanmanjari Devi .
He had one son and sarod heir , Ali Akbar Khan , and three daughters , Sharija , Jehanara and Annapurna who grew up as Roshanara Khan .
 Sharija died an early death suffering from diseases in Sharija childhood and when Jahanara got married and a jealous mother-in-law burnt her Tanpura , a shocked Alauddin Khan decided not to train Jahanara only remaining daughter .
 One day , however , Jahanara came home to discover Annapurna who grew up as Roshanara Khan teaching Sharija brother Ali Akbar Khan , and Sharija talent made the emotional father change his mind .
 Annapurna who grew up as Roshanara Khan learned classical vocal music , the Sitar , and Surbahar from Surbahar father .
 Surbahar later married and divorced Ravi Shankar .
 Khan was fond of sankeerna ragas , and created many ragas of his own , including Arjun , Bhagabati , Bhim , Bhuvaneshvari , Chandika , Dhabalashri , Dhankosh , Dipika , Durgeshvari , Gandhi , Gandhi Bilawal , Haimanti , Hem-Behag , Hemant Bhairav , Hemant Bhairav , Imni Manjh , Jaunpuri Todi , Kedar Manjh , Komal Bhimpalasi , Komal Marwa , Madanmanjari , Madhabsri , Madhavgiri , Malaya , Manjh Khamaj , Meghbahar , Muhammed , Nat-Khamaj , Prabhakali , Raj Bijoy , Rajeshri , Shobhavati , Subhabati , Sugandha and Surasati .
Many of these have not become common Maihar repertoire ; Manjh Khamaj is perhaps the best known .

 His Adana is an Indian raga .
 It is also called His Adana raga Darbari Kanada .
 It is often sang or played in drut laya after a vilambit composition in raga Darbari Kanada , as His Adana is straighter than Darbari in His Adana chalan , thus allowing faster passages .
 The flow of this raga is similar to a mix of Madhyamad Saranga with Darbari in its chalan .
Another common vivadi some artists use sparingly is shuddha ni which enhances the Saranga mood of the raga .
 Flat Ga is usually omitted in ascent and in descent always appears in the distinctive raga Darbari Kanada phrase g M R S. Flat Dha is present in descent , but one should never linger on it .
In fact it is omitted by some musicians completely .
Most movements are in the upper tetrachord , around high Sa .
It is very common to begin the elaboration of this raga with high Sa .
 His Adana was a major raga in the 17th century and a combination of the then current ragas Malhar and raga Darbari Kanada .
 In a ragamala from Mewar a ragamala from Mewar is depicted as an ascetic man sitting on a tiger skin , however , Somanatha describes Mewar as Kama the god of love .
 Mewar Adana was quite different from the raga as a ragamala from Mewar is performed today

Geet Ramayan is a collection of 56 Marathi language songs chronologically describing events from the Indian Hindu epic , the Ramayana .
It was broadcast by All India Radio , Pune in 1955-1956 , four years before television was introduced in India .
 Written by G. D. Madgulkar and the songs being composed by Sudhir Phadke , Geet Ramayan was acclaimed for writer G. D. Madgulkar lyrics , music and singing .
 It is considered a milestone of Marathi light music and the most popular Marathi version of the Ramayana , the demon-king Ravana .
 The team of writer G. D. Madgulkar and Musical director Sudhir Phadke presented a new song every week for a year with every song being aired first on a Friday morning and then again on Saturday and Sunday a Friday morning , between 8:45 AM and 9:00 AM IST .
The programs first song Kusa Lava Ramayan Gati was aired on 1 April 1955 .
 Though Geet Ramayan is based on sage Valmiki s epic the Ramayana , the demon-king Ravana , writer G. D. Madgulkar chose a different narrative format and was praised for the lyrics , and was called Adhunik Valmiki .
The Geet Ramayan is considered as the crescendo of Madgulkars literary vigour .
 Musical director Sudhir Phadke mainly used ragas of Hindustani classical music to compose the songs .
 Musical director Sudhir Phadke also selected the raga and the Tala of a song to suit the time of the incident and the narrative mood .
 The poet and composer were praised for The poet and composer contribution to the series .
 The series showcased a total of 32 various characters from the Ramayana , the demon-king Ravana .
 Rama being the lead character of the series was given maximum number of songs , followed by eight songs for the loss Sita .
 writer G. D. Madgulkar expressed The poet and composer various moods , ranging from The poet and composer divinity to the human weaknesses .
 Incidentally , the central antagonist of the the Ramayana , the demon-king Ravana and Geet Ramayan , the demon-king Ravana , was not given any song .
 The series is narrated by Kusha and Lava , twin sons of Rama and the loss Sita , and the writer of the Ramayana , the demon-king Ravana was also given one song in the series .
With increasing popularity since its release , Geet Ramayan has been translated into nine other languages : five Hindi translations and one each in Bengali , English , Gujarati , Kannada , Konkani , Sanskrit , Sindhi and Telugu .
It has also been transliterated into Braille .
Geet Ramayan was conceptualized in 1955 , four years before the introduction of television in India in 1959 .
 During the early days of All India Radio , Pune , station director Sitakant Lad wanted to begin a radio programme which would be entertaining and provide moral education .
 station director Sitakant Lad hence outlined station director Sitakant Lad plan to poet and writer G. D. Madgulkar .
Since the Ramayana is an Indian epic , Lad and Madgulkar came up with an idea of a version in singable verse .
 writer G. D. Madgulkar accepted the challenge , enlisting station director Sitakant Lad music-director friend Sudhir Phadke for the collaboration .
 The team of writer G. D. Madgulkar and Musical director Sudhir Phadke would present a new song every week for a year .
 Every song would be aired first on a Friday morning and then again on Saturday and Sunday a Friday morning , between 8:45 am and 9:00 am IST .
The programme was initially planned for a year , but 1955 in the Hindu calendar had an extra month ; therefore , four songs were added to extend the series to a total of fifty-six .
 Apart from the number of songs , writer G. D. Madgulkar and Musical director Sudhir Phadke left music , lyrics and choice of singers ad libitum .
 writer G. D. Madgulkar was given artistic liberty for the choice of the meters for the song , execution of the story line , and the message Musical director Sudhir Phadke could convey through it .
Initially , the programme was scheduled to begin on the occasion of Gudi Padwa , beginning of the New year according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar but later finalized to be Rama Navami , traditional birthday of Rama .
The programs first song Kusa Lava Ramayan Gati was aired on 1 April 1955 at 8:45 am IST .
 Vidya Madgulkar , the poets wife , recalled in an interview that writer G. D. Madgulkar wrote the first song and gave it to Musical director Sudhir Phadke the day before the recording ; however , Musical director Sudhir Phadke lost the lyrics .
 With the broadcast already scheduled , station director Sitakant Lad requested writer G. D. Madgulkar to re-write the song which was readily declined by an angered poet .
 Lad then decided to lock the poet in one of recording rooms equipped with all the required writing material and agreed to unlock the door only when writer G. D. Madgulkar is ready with the lyrics .
 writer G. D. Madgulkar then rewrote the lyrics from memory in fifteen minutes so Musical director Sudhir Phadke could compose the music .
 Though Adhunik Valmiki was the main inspiration for the Geet Ramayan , writer G. D. Madgulkar chose a different narrative format .
 Adhunik Valmiki used a simple lyrical format with a flexible number of stanzas .
The metre used was similar to Bhavageete , with roughly the same number of matras in each line .
The metre was also suited to the narration and the characters who sang the song .
 writer G. D. Madgulkar used various formats , including narrative , descriptive and communal songs .
 Bhavageete was praised for Bhavageete lyrics , and was called Adhunik Valmiki ; and the Geet Ramayan is considered the crescendo of Madgulkars literary vigour .
 Madgulkars narrative format was different than that of Valmikis where Bhavageete did not end the series with the coronation of Rama and the loss Sita , but included Sitas abandonment by Rama , and her giving birth to the twins , Lava and Kusha .
 However , Bhavageete chose not to include the last episode of Sitas final confrontation in Ramas court and Ramas entering the earth .
 writer G. D. Madgulkar ended the series with the song Ga Balano , Shriramayan which was voiced by Adhunik Valmiki where Adhunik Valmiki tells Adhunik Valmiki disciples , Lava and Kusha , how his disciples , Lava and Kusha should recite the Ramayana in front of Rama .
 Evidently , this also completes the cycle of songs where it had begun , with Lava and Kusha singing in Ramas court .
 writer G. D. Madgulkar did not make any attempt to provide new interpretation or meaning to the Ramayana but told the same story in the simpler and poetic format .
 With inclusion of characters like Ahalya and Shabari , Ahalya included the sentiments of religious devotion and also gave divine touch to the story while describing the marriage of the loss Sita and Rama as a union of Maya and Brahman .
 Ahalya composed songs on all seven chapters or Kanda of the Ramayana , the demon-king Ravana .
Out of 56 songs , poet composed twelve songs on Balakanda , seven on Ayodhya Kanda , fourteen on Aranya Kanda , three on Kishkindha Kanda , four on Sundara Kanda , twelve on Yuddha Kanda and three on Uttara Kanda .
 As the series became popular , the daily newspapers in Pune began to print the text of the new song every week after its first airing .
The first official edition of the text of these fifty-six poems and their prose narrations came out on the occasion of Vijayadashami , October 3 , 1957 , published for Akashwani by the director of the Publications Division , Delhi , in pocketbook size .
 Musical director Sudhir Phadke composed the songs based on the ragas of Hindu classical music , including Bhopali , Bhimpalasi and Madhuvanti .
The raga and Tala of a song was selected to suit the time of the incident and the narrative mood .
For example , the song Cala Raghava Cala is composed as a Bibhas raga , and the song describes an event taking place in the morning .
The songs Aj Mi Sapmucta Jahale and Yacka , Thambu Nako Darata are not based on a specific raga , but include several ragas in each song .
The singers , which included Vasantrao Deshpande , Manik Varma , Suresh Haldankar , Ram Phatak and Lata Mangeshkar , were familiar with the vocal style of Indian classical music .
 Musical director Sudhir Phadke voiced all the songs for Rama , and well-known Kirana gharana singer Manik Varma voiced the character of the loss Sita .
 Lata Mangeshkar sang one song for the loss Sita , Maj Sang Laksmana , in which the loss Sita questions Rama about Lata Mangeshkar abandonment but Lata Mangeshkar question remains unanswered .
A total of 32 characters from the Ramayana were voiced in the Geet Ramayan .
 writer G. D. Madgulkar expressed the emotions of characters such as Rama , the loss Sita , Hanuman - the monkey god and devotee of Rama - and Lakshmana ; Hanuman also attempted to give voice to the humblest characters in the epic .
The vanara are given a song describing a bridge forming over the ocean so Rama and his army could cross to Lanka .
The poet noted that the song described the sacrifice of joint labour and was an example of the principle , Union is strength .
Nishadraj Guha and the boatmen who helped Rama in crossing the Ganges river expressed themselves in Nakos Nauke Parat Phiru .
 The author of the Ramayana , Adhunik Valmiki , was also given a song with The author of the Ramayana advice to Ramas sons Kusha and Lava before Kusha appear before Ramas .
 Being hero of the the Ramayana , the demon-king Ravana and Geet Ramayan , writer G. D. Madgulkar expressed the varied moods of Ramas ; he was the most-voiced character in the Geet Ramayan with ten songs , followed by Sita with eight .
 He portrayed Ramas as a complex character full of emotions and passions , with some of the questionable deeds , yet bound by a traditional virtue and the sanctity of a promise .
 writer G. D. Madgulkar voiced Ramas personal ethical dilemmas along with his courage , and steadfastness .
He was shown to be patient with his brothers and mothers , obedient of father and sages , heroic on the battlefield , and diplomatic when dealing with the monkey king , Vali .
 writer G. D. Madgulkar is said to have successfully shown Ramas divinity alongside his human weaknesses .
 He was shown to be distracted at the loss the loss Sita , and wailed in Lakshmana presence .
 In another situation , he uttered some heart-wrenching words to the loss Sita , in front of his army with blaming Lakshmana for all the happenings , and then he was also shown to explain his behavior with oaths and confessions of loyalty to the loss Sita .
 Ramas mother , Kausalya , sang three on Kishkindha Kanda songs ; Bharata brother Bharata , Bharata father Dasharatha , Hanuman , Lakshmana , the demon Surpanakha , Ramas guru-sage Vishvamitra and Kusha-Lava have two songs each .
 The central antagonist of the Ramayana , the demon-king Ravana , was not given a song ; his oppressive presence was expressed in prose narration , poetic descriptions and songs sung by the other characters .
After Geet Ramayans original broadcast was over in March of 1956 , requests of re-broadcast were flooding the radio station .
All-India Radio repeated the entire series of fifty-six weekly songs due to popular demand .
 After the broadcast , Musical director Sudhir Phadke produced public concerts of selected songs .
The first public performance was held in the Madgulkars bungalow , Panchavati at Wakdewadi , Pune on 28 May 1958 .
In 1979 , a Silver Jubilee celebration of the programme took place at the New English School in Pune for eight nights .
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee , the then Minister of External Affairs , attended the show as the guest of honour along with the then Deputy Prime Minister of India Yashwantrao Chavan , Bollywood film director Basu Bhattacharya , actor Dada Kondke , and celebrated classical singers such as Bhimsen Joshi and Kishori Amonkar .
 Atal Bihari Vajpayee also attended the Golden Jubilee celebration with Sharad Pawar and Bal Thackeray .
National Award-winning art director Nitin Chandrakant Desai designed the stage depicting scenes from the Ramayana .
The event featured all the songs from the original Geet Ramayan now vocalized by Shridhar Phadke , Suresh Wadkar , Upendra Bhat , Padmaja Phenany Joglekar and others .
 As the radio programme became popular , daily newspapers in Pune began printing the lyrics of the new songs each week .
The publication department of All India Radio also compiled the lyrics and excerpts from the introductory comments in a book form .

The translations are :
Swaralipi is any system used in sheet music in order to represent aurally perceived music through the use of written for Indian classical music .
 The Indian scholar and musical theorist Pingala , in The Indian scholar Chanda Sutra , used marks indicating long and short syllables to indicate meters in Sanskrit poetry .
In the notation of Indian raga , a solfege-like system called sargam is used .
As in Western solfege , there are names for the seven basic pitches of a major scale .
The tonic of any scale is named Sa , and the dominant Pa. .
 Sa is fixed in any scale , and Pa is fixed at a fifth above Pa .
These two notes are known as achala swar .
 Each of the other five notes , Re , Ga , ma , Dha and Ni , can take a regular pitch , which is equivalent to Re pitch in a standard major scale , or an altered pitch , either a half-step above or half-step below the shuddha pitch .
 Re , Ga , Dha and Ni all have altered partners that are a half-step lower .
Ma has an altered partner that is a half-step higher .
 Re , Ga , ma , Dha and Ni are called vikrut swar .
 In the written system of Indian notation devised by Ravi Shankar , the pitches are represented by Western letters .
Capital letters are used for the achala swar , and for the higher variety of all the vikrut swar .
Lowercase letters are used for the lower variety of the vikrut swar

The Sarana Chatushtai is the only experiment according to Bharata Muni to obtain the correct physical configuration of Sruti swara arrangement to Shadja Grama Notes on a musical instrument .
The 22 Srutis are the only notes which can be useful for music in an `` octave '' , in this view .
The sections below describe the experiment .
Sarana Chatushtai experiment on two similar sitars .
The two veenas or sitars having the same qualities in all respect can be used to perform the Sarana Chatushtai experiment .
Establish the Shadjagrama on both the similar sitars as per the methodology explained in Natya Shastra chapter 28 to keep shruties distance wise for the respective notes of the shadjagrama .
Now we can measure the sruti value and hence provide 22 frets starting from the 5th sruti of second note Re .
 The assumption here which needs to be made to realize Bharata Munis shruti of first datum note being the sound of free string Sa , requires the assumption of 4 virtual shruties of Sa which are actually obtained in the higher octave after Ni .
This assumption though not explicitly stated in the Natya Shastra needs to be made as was discovered by Avinash Balkrishna Patwardhan and is required to prove the Sarana Chatushtai experiment .
The shruti distances as per the compression factors are calculated for all the 34 length of the string .
18 frets are required to reach up to the end note Ni of the saptak in both the instruments .
When finally both the instruments are set in the Shadjagrama , one sitar is to be kept as Achala i.e. the string tuning of this instrument remains unchanged during the entire experiment , whereas the other sitar is named as Chala i.e. the changes in tuning strings during the experiment are to be performed on this sitar .
The Panchama note of this Chala sitar is to be lowered by one Pramana-Shruti that is to bring this sitar in the Madhyamagrama .
 The procedure of Bharata Muni states that the Achala sitar Re note is first played as Sa note and the Pa note of the Chala sitar is lowered down in sound to be played as Ma note of the Achala sitars Re note .
Setting the Chala sitar in the Madhyamagrama by lowering the Pa note by one Pramana Shruti is the first part of the first Sarana .
The next part is to sound the Chala sitar to Shadjagrama tune .
Here all notes on the Chala sitar will sound less by one Pramana shruti than the notes on the permanently set Achala sitar in the Shadjagrama .
Repeat the above mentioned procedure to further lower down the Chala sitar by one more Pramana Sruti .
 Here we find when asked to play both the instruments , then the Ga note of Achala sitar will exactly match in tune or rather merge with the Re note of the Chala sitar , and the Ni note of Achala instrument merges with the Dha note of the Chala sitar .
Here we get the pair of 2 shruti values .
Repeat the above procedure once again and further lower down the Chala sitar by one more sruti in shadjagrama .
Now the difference in both the instruments set in Shadjagrama is of 3 Pramana Shruti values .
 Here we see the notes Sa and Pa of Achala sitar will merge in second note Re & Dha notes of Chala sitar .
Repeat this procedure once again to finally bring down the Chala sitar lower by 4 sruties than the Achala sitar initially set in Shadjagrama .
 Here we find the notes Ni , Ga , Ma of Achala sitar are found merging in the notes Sa , Ga , Ma of Achala sitar and Pa of Achala sitar of the Chala sitar .
 Only when all 4 sarana 's are successfully tuned and the sound notes cross checked as mentioned by Bharata Muni , then only one can know the 22 shrutis of Shadjagrama as required by the Natya Shastra

Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar was a Hindustani musician .
 Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar sang the original version of the bhajan Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram , and founded the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya in 1901 .
 Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar original surname was Gadgil , but as they hailed from the village Palus , they came to be known as the Paluskar family .
Vishnu Digambar Paluskar was born in a Marathi family of Kurundwad , a small town falling under the Deccan division of Bombay Presidency during British rule , presently in Maharashtra .
 Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar father , Digambar Gopal Paluskar , was a singer of Kirtan .
 Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar went to a local school in Kurundwad for primary education .
 But tragedy struck Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar at an early age .
 During a Hindustani festival called Datta Jayanti , a fire-cracker burst near Hindustani face damaging both Hindustani eyes .
 Being a small town , there was no immediate treatment available and Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar lost Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar eyesight .
 Nevertheless , Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar regained it some years later .
The king of Miraj recognising the talent in the boy put him under the guidance of Balakrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar , a learned musician .
Paluskar trained under him for 12 years until in 1896 the relations between the teacher and student became strained .
After that Paluskar began touring the country and studied the musical traditions in each part of Northern India .
 Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar went from place to place and visited many royal families in cities like Baroda and Gwalior , well known for their patronage of musicians .
 But Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar broke a long standing tradition of Indian music by giving a public concert in Saurashtra and charging a nominal fee .
Till then , concerts were given only in palaces or temples .
He studied Brijbhasha , a dialect of Hindi , spoken at Mathura .
 Vishnu Digambar met Pandit Chandan Chaube and learnt Dhrupad music from Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar .
 In 1901 , Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar reached Lahore , where Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar decided to establish a music school .
 On May 5 , 1901 Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar founded the Gandharva Mahavidyalaya , a School to impart formal training in Indian classical music .
 a School was a school open to all and one of the first in Northern India to run on public support and donations , rather than royal patronage .
 a School was a challenge to the traditional method where a student lived under the teachers roof .
Many students from the Schools early batches became respected musicians and teachers in North India .
 a School brought respect to musicians , who were treated with disdain earlier .
 In September 1908 , Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar went to Bombay to establish another branch of the School .
 As the work-load increased , Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar shifted the school from Lahore to Bombay .
 To accommodate all the students , Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar took loans , built a new building for the school and hostel as well .
 To settle debts , Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar gave several public concerts .

 Pandit Vishnu Digambar Paluskar died on August 21 , 1931 .
 On July 21 , 1973 , the Posts and Telegraph Department , Government of Northern India paid homage to Pandit Paluskar by releasing a commemorative stamp .

Dhrupad is a vocal genre in Hindustani classical music , said to be the oldest still in use in that musical tradition .
 Dhrupad name is derived from the words dhruva and pada , where a part of the poem is used as a refrain .
 The term may denote both the verse form of the poetry and the style in which The term is sung .
 Abul Fazl , courtier and chronicler at the court of the Emperor Akbar , defines the dhrupad verse form in Abul Fazl Ain-e-Akbari as four rhyming lines , each of indefinite prosodic length .
Thematic matter ranges from the religious and spiritual to royal panegyrics , musicology and romance .
 Though Dhrupad is basically a vocal tradition , Dhrupad musical aesthetics have been adopted by many instrumentalists .
 Not only by various schools of Rudra Veena players but also by other instrumentalists , who look to Dhrupad for examples for Rudra Veena players instrumental developments of raga , and go as far as to adapt the format : a slow , unmetered alaapa , Jhor , Jhala , to be concluded with one or more compositions in contrasting talas .
 Ram Narayan and Hariprasad Chaurasia , to name but two acclaimed instrumentalists , pay homage to Dhrupad in the way Ram Narayan and Hariprasad Chaurasia present a raga .
 The earliest source that mentions a musical genre called Dhrupad is Ain-i-Akbari of Abu Fazl .
Later works attribute much of the material to musicians in the court of Man Singh Tomar of Gwalior .
 In these accounts from the Mughal court Dhrupad is portrayed as a musical form which is relatively new ; and according to Ritwik Sanyal , most sources agree that Drupad owes Drupad origin to the court of Man Singh Tomar .
There is reference to Dhrupad in Bharats Natya Shastra , commonly dated to the 1st Century AD , and even in Sangit Ratnakar , a 13th Century text , taken as authoritative .
Ravi Shankar states that the form appeared in the fifteenth century as a development from the prabandha , which it replaced .
Under Mughal rule it was appropriated as court music .
However the musical background of dhrupad is commonly thought to have a long history , traceable back to the Vedas themselves .
The Yugala Shataka of Shri Shribhatta in the Nimbarka Sampradaya , written in 1294 CE , contains lyrics of similar fashion .
Swami Haridas , the guru of Tansen , was a well known dhrupad singer .
The 18th Century saw the beginning of a great decline of dhrupad singing .
A newer genre , khyal , which had coexisted with dhrupad for a couple of centuries , and which emerged partly as a reaction against so-called nibaddha or pre-composed music , gained popularity at dhrupads expense , placing fewer constraints on the singers and allowing greater improvisation and displays of virtuosity rare in dhrupad .
Also , new instruments were being developed - the sitar and the sarod - that were not suited to the slow tempo and low register favoured by dhrupad so that dhrupad instrumental also began to lose ground .
Only a few families carried on the tradition .
In 1960 the French ethnomusicologist Alain Danielou invited Nasir Moinuddin and Nasir Aminuddin Dagar to perform in Europe .
 Their concerts were successful and , upon the untimely demise of Nasir Moinuddin in 1966 , Nasir Moinuddin younger brothers Nasir Zahiruddin and Nasir Fayazuddin continued .
The Dagars toured widely and recorded .
Coinciding with growing foreign interest in Indian music , the Dagarvani-revival helped breathe new life into a few other families of dhrupad singers .
Today , dhrupad enjoys a place as a well-respected but not widely popular genre , no longer on the brink of extinction .
Dhrupad as we know it today is performed by a solo singer or a small number of singers in unison to the beat of the pakhavaj or mridang rather than the tabla .
The vocalist is usually accompanied by two tanpuras , the players sitting close behind , with the percussionist at the right of the vocalist .
Traditionally the only other instrument used was the Rudra Veena .
Some artists have used other instruments .
Preferably , such instruments should have a deep bass register and long sustain .
Like all Indian classical music , dhrupad is modal and monophonic , with a single melodic line and no chord progression .
Each raga has a modal frame - a wealth of micro-tonal ornamentations are typical .
The text is preceded by a wholly improvised section , the alap .
The alap in dhrupad is sung using a set of syllables , popularly thought to be derived from a mantra , in a recurrent , set pattern : a re ne na , te te re ne na , ri re re ne na , te ne toom ne .
Dhrupad styles have long elaborate alaps , their slow and deliberate melodic development gradually bringing an accelerating rhythmic pulse .
In most styles of dhrupad singing it can easily last an hour , broadly subdivided into the alap proper , the jor and the jhala or nomtom , when syllables are sung at a very rapid pace .
Then the composition is sung to the rhythmic accompaniment : the four lines , in serial order , are termed sthayi , antara , sanchari and aabhog .
Compositions exist in the metres tivra , sul and chau - a composition set to the 10-beat jhap tala is called a sadra while one set to the 14-beat dhamar is called a dhamar .
The latter is seen as a lighter musical form , associated with the Holi spring festival .
Alongside concert performance the practice of singing dhrupad in temples continues , though only a small number of recordings have been made .
It bears little resemblance to concert dhrupad : there is very little or no alap ; percussion such as bells and finger cymbals , not used in the classical setting , are used here , and the drum used is a smaller , older variant called mrdang , quite similar to the mridangam .
 There are said to be four broad stylistic variants of classical dhrupad - the Gauri , Khandar , Nauhar , and Nasir Aminuddin Dagar , tentatively linked to five singing styles known from the 7th Century : Shuddha , Bhinna , Gauri , Vegswara , and Sadharani .
But more importantly , there are a number of dhrupad gharanas : houses , or family styles .
The best-known gharana is the Dagar family , who sing in the Dagar vani .
The Dagar style puts great emphasis on alap and for several generations their singers have performed in pairs .
 The Dagars are Muslims but sing Hindustani texts of Gods and Goddesses .
Some of the best dhrupad singers outside the Dagar family , such as Uday Bhawalkar , Ritwik Sanyal and the Gundecha Brothers , also belong to the Dagar vani .

Chants of India is an album by Indian musician Ravi Shankar released in 1997 on Angel Records .
 Produced by his friend and sometime collaborator George Harrison , the album consists of Vedic and other Hindu sacred prayers set to music , marking a departure from Shankars more familiar work in the field of Hindu classical music .
The lyrical themes of the recorded chants are peace and harmony among nature and all creatures .
Sessions for the album took place in the Indian city of Madras and at Harrisons home in Henley-on-Thames , Oxfordshire , following his work on The Beatles Anthology .
Anoushka Shankar , John Barham , Bikram Ghosh , Tarun Bhatacharaya and Ronu Majumdar are among the many musicians who contributed to the recording .
 Chants of India was well received by reviewers ; author Peter Lavezzoli describes India as a quiet masterpiece and the most fully realized collaboration by Shankar and George Harrison .
 Shankar considered India to be among the best works of author Peter Lavezzoli 60-year career .
In 2010 , the album was reissued as part of the Dark Horse Records box set Ravi Shankar-George Harrison , Collaborations , which combined various projects undertaken by the two artists , beginning in 1973 .
 Chants of India was the last formal collaboration between Shankar and George Harrison , who was diagnosed with cancer shortly after India release .
 At the Concert for George in November 2002 , Shankar incorporated some of the selections from Chants of India , including the album-closing Sarve Shaam , in a set performed by daughter Anoushka as a tribute to George Harrison .
Having maintained a close friendship in the decades since their last official collaboration in 1974 , Ravi Shankar and George Harrison began working together in 1995 on projects to celebrate Shankars 75th birthday .
 George Harrison first produced a four-disc career retrospective issued on EMI s Angel Records , Ravi Shankar : In Celebration , which also included unreleased recordings made by the pair , before serving as editor on Shankars second autobiography , Raga Mala .
 When compiling In Celebration , Shankar and George Harrison discussed with Angel Records the possibility of making an album of Vedic chants and other Hindu sacred texts set to music .
According to Shankar , the record company were hoping to repeat the commercial success of a recording by those Spanish monks .
 Shankar had grown up in the Hindu holy city of Benares , where the public chanting of Vedic hymns the public chanting of Vedic hymns passion for music , author Reginald Massey writes , and as a young man during the 1940s he had embraced the concept of Nada Brahma , under the strict tutelage of music guru Allauddin Khan .
 In Hindu liner notes to Chants of India , Shankar nevertheless describes the undertaking as one of the most difficult challenges in my life , as a composer and arranger .
 Shankar noted the precedents for such a venture : Sanskrit chants from the Vedas , Upanishads and other scriptures have been recorded by many in India and elsewhere , either in Vedas original form by the Traditional Scholars ... or sung within raga forms by eminent musicians with accompanying instruments .
 Some have even attempted to make Some more popular by using a semi-classical and commercial approach .
I wanted to make a version different from all these , but still maintain the tremendous spiritual force , and purity of the Suktas , Shlokas and Mantras , and at the same time make it universally appealing .
 Harrison biographer Gary Tillery biographer Gary Tillery describes the songs focus , following the opening invocations , as peace , love , ecology , and social harmony .
 Chants of India reunited Shankar and Harrison biographer Gary Tillery with English musician and arranger John Barham .
 arranger John Barham provided Western annotation of Shankars melodies , a role arranger John Barham had first supplied for Shankar at the Bath Music Festival in 1966 , when the Indian sitar virtuoso had duetted with Yehudi Menuhin .
 Anoushka Shankar conducted the musicians at the sessions , Shankar and Harrison biographer Gary Tillery decided to move the project to Harrisons recording facility at Friar Park , Harrison biographer Gary Tillery home in Henley-on-Thames , Oxfordshire .
 According to Harrison biographer Gary Tillery , Madras had been chosen in order to cultivate authenticity , being a music capital of the South Asian region , yet the atmosphere at Sruthilaya seemed too secular for the aura of spirituality they wanted to create .
 A large cast of local musicians contributed to the recording in Madras , on instruments such as veena , violin , flute , cello , tanpura and mridangam , while the chorus singers numbered 21 .
 The pilgrimage inspired Harrison biographer Gary Tillery in Harrison biographer Gary Tillery current work with Shankar , author Joshua Greene writes , just as a 1974 visit to Vrindavan had been the catalyst for staging Shankars Music Festival from India revue and their joint North American tour that year .
 In July 1996 , Shankar and Harrison biographer Gary Tillery reconvened at Friar Park , after Harrison biographer Gary Tillery had recorded a contribution for Carl Perkins Go , Cat , Go !
album .
 The Friar Park sessions for Chants of India took place in the houses drawing room , with cables fed through from the studio area above - the same arrangement under which Harrison biographer Gary Tillery had produced the Music Festival from India studio album , in summer 1974 .
 From 7 July 1996 , sessions ran intermittently through to late August .
 Shankar later told Rolling Stone magazine that Harrison biographer Gary Tillery wrote Mangalam at this time : Mangalam came to me while I was walking in Friar Park , George in November 2002 place , where we were recording .
I was looking at the trees and the sky , and feeling very elated all of a sudden , wishing everything should be good for everyone , and it just came to me .
Among the participating musicians at Friar Park were Shankars occasional tabla player Bikram Ghosh , along with Tarun Bhatacharaya , Ronu Mazumdar and Jane LIster .
Shankars wife Sukanya , a trained singer in the Karnatak tradition , was also among the vocalists during what the album sleeve lists as the London sessions .
 Harrison biographer Gary Tillery was so moved that Harrison biographer Gary Tillery embraced me with tears in Harrison biographer Gary Tillery eyes and simply said , Thank you , Ravi , for this music .
 According to author Peter Lavezzoli , the album was one of Shankars personal favorite works .
Angel Records issued Chants of India on 6 May 1997 in America , with a UK release following on 1 September .
 The album was marketed as a collaborative work , and Harrison biographer Gary Tillery joined Shankar in promoting the release .
 These activities included television appearances in New York and Paris , one of which , for Americas VH1 network , aired on 24 July 1996 as George & Ravi - Yin & Yang .
 In what would turn out to be Harrisons final performance on a TV show , 24 July as George & Ravi - Yin & Yang and Shankar discussed the album and he and Shankar shared experiences , such as the Concert for Bangladesh .
 Harrison biographer Gary Tillery then accepted an acoustic guitar from host John Fugelsang and performed songs including the just-released Prabhujee , sung with Ravi and Sukanya Shankar .
 Chants of India was critically well-received , while commercially India peaked at number 3 on Billboard magazines Top World Music Albums chart .
 Peter Lavezzoli writes of the album : Chants of India is a quiet masterpiece , one of the most uplifting and musically engaging recordings of scared music ... Harrisons production created the ideal setting for each chant , all of which are exquisitely sung , and the album remains the most fully realized collaboration between both artists .
 Jim Brenholts of Allmusic similarly praises the work : Shankars style and diversity allow Jim Brenholts of Allmusic to open doors that are closed to other musicians ... Shankars compositional and sound-design styles add atmosphere .
 Harrisons deft touch allows the music to develop and maintain Allmusic own integrity .
Among records of this nature , this one is special .
 Harrison biographer Alan Clayson biographer Alan Clayson describes Chants of India as a thoroughly diverting production that sung lyrics as succinct as haiku and instrumental passages of a quirky complexity vaguely reminiscent of Frank Zappa .
 Chants of India was the last formal musical collaboration between Shankar and Harrison biographer Alan Clayson .
 During promotion for the album in summer 1997 , Harrison biographer Alan Clayson was diagnosed with cancer , a condition Harrison biographer Alan Clayson was then thought to have beaten until a near-fatal stabbing by a deranged fan , on 30 December 1999 , encouraged its return .
 On 29 November 2002 , a year after Harrison biographer Alan Clayson death at the age of 58 , Shankar included selections from Chants of India in the opening , Indian music portion of the Concert for 24 July as George & Ravi - Yin & Yang , held at the Royal Albert Hall in London .
 Anoushka Shankar performed the set , as sitarist and conductor , backed by some of the musicians and singers who had contributed to the Friar Park sessions in 1996 , including Sukanya Shankar , Chandrashekhar , M. Balachandar and Jane LIster .
 The album-closing Sarve Shaam appears at the start of David Leland s Concert for 24 July as George & Ravi - Yin & Yang documentary film , .
 As part of Ravi Shankars 90th birthday celebrations in 2010 , Dark Horse Records reissued Chants of India in a four-disc box set titled Ravi Shankar-George Harrison Collaborations .
 A project overseen and produced by Olivia Harrison , the box set also included the albums Shankar Family & Friends and Ravi Shankars Music Festival from India , together with previously unreleased film of the Music Festivals debut performance in September 1974 , directed by Stuart Cooper .
All songs are traditional , adapted by Ravi Shankar , except where noted
 Raga Sohni is a raga in Hindustani classical music in the Marwa thaat .
Alternate transliterations include Sohani and Sohini .
 Like Bahar , Sohini is a small raga , with not much space for elaboration .
 Sohini emotes the feel of longing , of passive sensuousness .
 The raga is of audav-shadav nature , i.e , Sohini has five swaras in the arohana and six in the avarohana .
Rishabh is komal and Madhyam is Tivra , while all other swaras are shuddha .
Pancham is not used .
Pakad : 1 .
Sa Ni Dha , Ga Ma # Dha Ga Ma # Ga. 2 .
Sa Ni Dha , Ni Dha Ga Ma # , Ga Ma # , Ga Re # Sa .
 The rishabh is weak , but Gandhar is strong , unlike Marwa .
 Gandhar is an Uttaranga pradhan raga , with the higher notes on the saptak being used more frequently .
Raga Sohni is associated with very late night / pre-dawn , the last or eighth period of day , roughly from 3-6AM .
 It is somewhat similar to Marwa and Puriya ragas in the same thaat , and also to Basant in the Poorvi thaat

His voice had a wide range , spanning three octaves , effortless rendition , sweetness , flexibility and ease of movement in all tempi .
His raga expositions were brief , contrary to convention , and while he agreed that the beauty of classical music lay in leisurely improvisation , he believed that the audience would not appreciate long alaps , and he had to sing for the masses and change the music to what the audience wanted .
 After the partition of India in 1947 , Khan went to his home in Pakistan , but returned to India in 1947 later to reside permanently .
 He did not approve of the partition , stating : If in every home one child was taught Hindustani classical music this country would never have been partitioned .

Tala , Taal or Tal , is the term used in Indian classical music for the rhythmic pattern of any composition and for the entire subject of rhythm , roughly corresponding to metre in Western music , though closer conceptual equivalents are to be found in the older system of rhythmic mode and its relations with the foot of classical poetry , or with other Asian classical systems such as the notion of usul in the theory of Ottoman/Turkish music .
A tala is a regular , repeating rhythmic phrase , particularly as rendered on a percussive instrument with an ebb and flow of various intonations represented as a theka , a sequence of drum-syllables or bol .
Indian classical music , both northern and southern , has complex , all-embracing rules for the elaboration of possible patterns and each such pattern has its own name , though in practice a few talas are very common while others are rare .
The most common instrument for keeping rhythm in Hindustani music is the tabla , while in Carnatic music it is the mridangam .
Each repeated cycle of a tala is called an avartan .
This is counted additively in sections which roughly correspond to bars or measures but may not have the same number of beats and may be marked by accents or rests .
So the Hindustani Jhoomra tal has 14 beats , counted 3 +4 +3 +4 , which differs from Dhamar tal , also of 14 beats but counted 5 +2 +3 +4 .
 The spacing of the vibhag accents makes This distinct , otherwise , again , since Rupak tal consists of 7 beats , two cycles of it of would be indistinguishable from one cycle of the related Dhamar tal .
However the most common Hindustani tala , Teental , is a regularly-divisible cycle of four measures of four beats each .
The first beat of any tala , called sam is always the most important and heavily emphasised .
 The first beat of any tala , called sam is the point of resolution in the rhythm where the percussionists and soloists phrases culminate : a soloist has to sound an important note of the raga there , and a North Indian classical dance composition must end there .
However , melodies do not always begin on the first beat of the tala but may be offset , for example to suit the words of a composition so that the most accented word falls upon the sam .
The term talli , literally shift , is used to describe this offset in Tamil .
 A composition may also start with an anacrusis on one of the last beats of the previous cycle of the tala , called ateeta eduppu in Tamil .
The tala is indicated visually by using a series of rhythmic hand gestures called kriyas that correspond to the angas or limbs , or vibhag of the tala .
 These movements define the tala in Carnatic music , and in the Hindustani tradition too , when learning and reciting the tala , the first beat of any vibhag is known as tali and is accompanied by a clap of the hands , while an empty vibhag is indicated with a sideways wave of the dominant clapping hand or the placing of the back of the hand upon the base hands palm instead .
 But northern definitions of tala rely far more upon specific drum-strokes , known as bols , each with the tala in Carnatic music own name that can be vocalized as well as written .
In one common notation the sam is denoted by an X and the khali , which is always the first beat of a particular vibhag , denoted by 0 .
A tala does not have a fixed tempo and can be played at different speeds .
In Hindustani classical music a typical recital of a raga falls into two or three parts categorized by the quickening tempo of the music ; Vilambit , Madhya and Drut .
Carnatic music adds an extra slow and fast category , categorised by divisions of the pulse ; Chauka , Vilamba , Madhyama , Dhuridha and lastly Adi-dhuridha .
Carnatic music uses various classification systems of talas such as the Chapu , Chanda and Melakarta .
The Suladi Sapta Tala system is used here , according to which there are seven families of tala .
A tala can not exist without reference to one of five jatis , differentiated by the length in beats of the laghu , thus allowing thirty-five possible talas .
With all possible combinations of tala types and laghu lengths , there are 5 x 7 = 35 talas having lengths ranging from 3 to 29 aksharas .
The seven tala families and the number of aksharas for each of the 35 talas are ; .
In practice , only a few talas have compositions set to them .
The most common tala is Chaturasra-nadai Chaturasra-jaati Triputa tala , also called Adi tala .
Nadai is a term which means subdivision of beats .
Many kritis and around half of the varnams are set to this tala .
Other common talas include : .
The Suladi Saptha Tala system uses three of six possible angas in different arrangements ; .
Each tala can incorporate one of five jatis .
 Each tala family has a default jati associated with Each tala ; the tala name mentioned without qualification refers to the default jati ; .
For example one cycle of khanda-jati rupaka tala comprises a 2-beat dhrutam followed by a 5-beat laghu .
cycle is thus 7 aksharas long .
Chaturasra jati khanda-jati Rupaka tala has 7 aksharam , each of which is 4 matras long ; each avartana of the tala is 4 x 7 = 28 matras long .
For Misra-jati Khanda-jati Rupaka tala , it would be 7 x 7 = 49 matra .
The number of maatras in an akshara is called the nadai .
This number can be 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 or 9 , and take the same name as the jatis .
The default nadai is Chatusram : .
Sometimes , pallavis are sung as part of a Ragam Thanam Pallavi exposition in some of the rarer , more complicated talas ; such pallavis , if sung in a non-Chatusra-nadai tala , are called nadai pallavis .
In addition , pallavis are often sung in chauka kale , although this trend seems to be slowing .
Talas have a vocalised and therefore recordable form wherein individual beats are expressed as phonetic representations of various strokes played upon the tabla .
 Various Gharanas also have Talas own preferences .
 For example , the Kirana Gharana uses Ektaal more frequently for Vilambit Khayal while the Jaipur Gharana uses Ada Trital , a variation of Trital .
 Jaipur Gharana is also known to use Ada Trital , a variation of Ada Trital , a variation of Trital for transitioning from Vilambit to Drut laey .
 The khal vibhag has no beats on the bayan , i.e. no bass beats this can be seen as a way to enforce the balance between the usage of heavy and fine beats or more simply The khal vibhag can be thought of another mnemonic to keep track of the rhythmic cycle .
The khali is played with a stressed syllable that can easily be picked out from the surrounding beats .
Some rare talas even contain a half-beat .
For example , Dharami is an 11 1/2 beat cycle where the final Ka only occupies half the time of the other beats .
This talas 6th beat does not have a played syllable - in western terms it is a rest .
 Some talas , for example Chau talas , Ek , Hindustani Jhoomra and Chau talas , lend Chau talas better to slow and medium tempos .
 Others flourish at faster speeds , like Jhap or Rupak tal talas .
 Ada Trital , a variation of Trital or Teental is one of the most popular , since Ada Trital , a variation of Trital is as aesthetic at slower tempos as Ada Trital , a variation of Trital is at faster speeds .
 There are many taals in Hindustani music , some of the more popular ones are : .
Other than these 35 talas there are 108 so-called anga talas .
The following is the exhaustive pattern of beats used in constructing them .
Compositions are rare in these lengthy talas .
They are mostly used in performing the Pallavi of Ragam Thanam Pallavis .
Some examples of anga talas are : .
Another type of tala is the chhanda tala .
 These are talas set to the lyrics of the Thirupugazh by the Tamil composer Arunagirinathar .
 the Thirupugazh is said to have written 16000 hyms each in a different chhanda tala .
 Of These , only 1500-2000 are available

Baazis jazzy musical score revealed a new facet of singer Geeta Dutt , who was mainly known for melancholy songs and bhajans .
 While every song in the film was a hit , one stood out for special appeal - Tadbir se Bigdi Hui Taqdeer , a ghazal that was occidentalised into a seductive song.The jaal song Yeh raat Yeh Duniya Roop ki Chor chandni by Hemant Kumar is an all time great classic .
 Bigdi Hui Taqdeer also wrote music for the Guru Dutt classics - Pyaasa and Kaagaz Ke Phool .
 The soundtrack of Devdas was also composed by Devdas .
House No. 44 , Funtoosh , and Solva Saal were other S D Burman hits .
In 1959 came Sujata , a masterpiece by Bimal Roy , and S D created magic again with Jalte hai jiske liye by Talat Mamood .
 When Guru Dutt made comparatively light-weight films like Baazi and Jaal , Burmanda reflected House No. 44 , Funtoosh , and Solva Saal mood with compositions like Suno Gajar Kya Gaye or De Bhi Chuke Hum and when Guru Dutt made his somber masterpieces - Pyaasa and Kaagaz ke Phool , he was right on target with Jinhe Naaz Hai Hind and Waqt ne Kiya Kya Haseen Sitam .
In 2004 , the soundtrack for Pyaasa was chosen as one of The Best Music in Film by Sight & Sound , the British Film Institute magazine .
 In 1957 , S D Burman fell out with Lata Mangeshkar and adopted Lata Mangeshkar younger sister Asha Bhosle as his lead female singer .

Ill health caused a slump in his career in the early 1960s but he gave many hit films in late 1960s .

 That Movie also had a Song , Nache Mann Mora Magan , sung by Mohammed Rafi , which songs Sachin Das capability to compose classical songs .
 Other S D Burman hits from this period were Paar Bandini and Ziddi .
 In Paar Bandini , Sampooran Singh , made Sampooran Singh debut as a lyricist with the song Mora Gora Ang lai le , mohe shaam rang daai de , although other songs were written by Shailendra .
 Guide starring Dev Anand , was probably the best of Dev Anand work during the time with all the songs super hit as well as the film ; but unfortunately Guide starring Dev Anand did not receive the Filmfare Award in best music director category for that year , which remained always a discussion among the Bollywood film pandits .
 Aradhana is considered a landmark score in the Bollywood history .
The music of the movie shaped the careers of singer Kishore Kumar , lyricist Anand Bakshi , filmmaker Shakti Samanta and R.D. Burman .
For the song Mere Sapno ki raani , Sachin Dev made R.D play the mouth organ .
 Dev Anand and S D Burman continued the song Mere Sapno ki raani musical partnership in Prem Pujari .
S D Burman was a frank and outspoken man , with a strong sense of self-pride .
He openly criticised people whom he disliked or whose abilities he suspected .
But he was widely respected by the industry as a cranky genius.There was a time when Lata Mangeshkar refused to sing duets with Mohammed Rafi due to a dispute arising from sharing of royalty , and it was at the insistence of S. D. Burman , the two decided to reconcile , and again sing duets together .
 Tere Mere Sapne , Sharmeelee , Abhimaan , Prem Nagar , Sagina , Chupke Chupke , and the film Mili are other classics from this period .

 Sachin Da was the only composer who had used both telephone Kishore and Mohammed Rafi in almost equal number of songs .
 He regarded telephone Kishore as his second son .
 telephone Kishore confessed that it was Sachin Da , who had given him the first chance .
 Even after the rehearsal of Badi Sooni Sooni from Milli , when Sachin Da had a stroke , telephone Kishore went up to the hospital and said to Badi Sooni Sooni from Milli that Dada , Please dont worry , your recording is after 3 days , you just see how well it goes .

, and the song is considered as one of the best songs of Kishore Kumar .
 Sachin Da also used to telephone Kishore in the dead of night and on the telephone , he would start to sing the new tunes which he composed and ask telephone Kishore to sing with telephone Kishore .
 British singer of South Asian heritage , Najma Akhtar , recorded a Shanachie Records CD of Burmans work , Forbidden Kiss : The Music of S.D. Burman , an album of covers of Burman compositions .
 The Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar was named after the composer by Sachin grandfather , who was an ardent fan of Burman .
The singer and mimicry artist Sudesh Bhonsle frequently parodies the nasal high-pitched voice and quixotic singing style of S. D. Burman .
 Burman paired with tabla maestro late Brajen Biswas for his Bengali Thumri songs .
The beats or thekas created by Brajen Babu for these songs are unique and no one in the world can sing these songs in the original thekas .
All the thekas are according to the mood of the songs .
But recently , painter , sculptor and singer Ramita Bhaduri sang the tough songs of Burman like Ami chhinu aka , Rangeela , Aankhi Duti Jhare etc. in the original theka on the taleem of Brajen Biswas .
The CD from Raga Music was released at Kolkata Press Club .
The CDs are available in M. Biswas & Symphony .
Burman had a unique style of composing film songs .
While most of the composers used harmonium or piano to compose the tune , he composed tunes using rhythm such as clapping hands .
He was very fond of Paan and would not share the same with anybody
Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande was an Indian musicologist who wrote the first modern treatise on Hindustani Classical Music , an art which had been propagated earlier for a few centuries mostly through oral traditions .
During those earlier times , the art had undergone several changes , rendering the raga grammar documented in scant old texts outdated .
Ragas used to be classified into Raga , Ragini , and Putra .
 Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande reclassified them into the currently used Thaat system .
 Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande noted that several ragas did not conform to their description in ancient Sanskrit texts .
 Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande explained the ragas in an easy-to-understand language and composed several bandishes which explained the grammar of the ragas .
 Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande borrowed the idea of lakshan geet from the Carnatic music scholar Venkatamakhin .
Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande was born in 1860 , into a Chittapawan Brahmin family in Walkeshwar , Mumbai .
 Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande was educated at Elphinstone College in Walkeshwar , Mumbai and Deccan College in Pune .

 During Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande travels in India , Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande spent time in Baroda , Gwalior , and Rampur .
 In Rampur Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande was the disciple of legendary Veena Player Ustad Wazir Khan , the descendant of Miyan Tansen .
Bhatkhandes first published work , Swar Malika , was a booklet containing detailed descriptions of all prevalent ragas .
In 1909 , he published Shri Mallakshaya Sangeetam , in Sanskrit , under the pseudonym Chatur-pandit .
To make this cultural heritage accessible to the common man , he published commentary on his own Sanskrit grantha in Marathi over a span of several years ; it was published over four volumes bearing the title : Hindustani Sangeet Paddhati .
 These volumes form today the standard text on Hindustani Classical Music music , an indispensable starting point for any student of Hindustani Classical Music .
His disciple S N Ratanjankar , famous musician Shri .
 Dilip Kumar Roy , Ratanjankars disciple K. G. Ginde , S.C.R.Bhatt , Ram Ashrey Jha Ramrang , Sumati Mutatkar and Krishna Kumar Kapoor are among the notable scholars who followed in the footsteps of Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande .
 Dilip Kumar Roy notation system became standard and though later scholars like Pt .
V. D. Paluskar , Vinayak Narayan Patwardhan and Pt .
 Omkarnath Thakur introduced their improved versions , Pt remained a publishers favorite .
 Pt suffered a setback with onset of desktop publishing , which found inserting marks above and below Devanagari text cumbersome ; as a result , books carrying compositions yielded to theoretical texts .
A recently developed notation system Ome Swarlipi follows the logical structure introduced by Pt .
 Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande but uses symbols instead of Devanagari alphabets .
 After travelling widely and having discussions with practitioners of various schools , Pandit Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande arranged all the ragas of Hindustani Classical Music classical music across 10 musical scales , called thaats .
Though the thaats do not encompass all possible ragas , they do cover the vast majority , and are a key contribution to Indian musical theory .

 At age 21 , Mary Ellen Amos moved to Los Angeles to pursue Mary Ellen Amos music career after several years performing on the piano bar circuit of the Washington , D.C. area .
 In 1986 , Mary Ellen Amos formed a music group , Y Kant Tori Read , the name of which was a reference to Mary Ellen Amos days at the Peabody Conservatory , where Mary Ellen Amos was able to play songs on Mary Ellen Amos piano by ear , but was never successful at sight reading .
 In addition to Mary Ellen Amos , the group was composed of Steve Caton , drummer Matt Sorum , bass player Brad Cobb and , for a short time , keyboardist Jim Tauber .
 Following several phases of writing and recording , during which Mary Ellen Amos has since asserted that the band lost their musical edge and direction due to interference from record executives , in July 1988 , the Y Kant Tori Read s self-titled debut album was released .
 Although its producer , Joe Chiccarelli , has stated that Mary Ellen Amos was very happy with the album at the time , it is now out of print and Mary Ellen Amos has expressed no interest in reissuing it .
 Following the albums commercial failure and the groups subsequent disbanding , Mary Ellen Amos began working with other artists as a backup vocalist .
 Mary Ellen Amos also recorded a song called Distant Storm for the film China OBrien ; in the credits , the song is attributed to a band called Tess Makes Good .
It was the only song recorded by the band , and its only commercial release was in the film .
 Despite the disappointing reaction to Y Kant Tori Read , Mary Ellen Amos still had to comply with the Y Kant Tori Read six-record contract with Atlantic Records , who in 1989 wanted a new record by March 1990 .
 The initial recordings were declined by the label , which Mary Ellen Amos felt was because the album had not been properly presented .
 The album was reworked and expanded under the guidance of Doug Morris and the musical talents of Steve Caton , Eric Rosse , Will MacGregor , Carlo Nuccio , and Dan Nebenzal , resulting in Little Earthquakes , an album recounting Mary Ellen Amos religious upbringing , sexual awakening , struggle to establish Mary Ellen Amos identity , and sexual assault .
 This album became Mary Ellen Amos commercial and artistic breakthrough .
 Mary Ellen Amos traveled to New Mexico with personal and professional partner Eric Rosse in 1993 to write and largely record Mary Ellen Amos second solo record , Under the Pink .
The album was received with mostly favorable reviews and sold enough copies to chart at No. 12 on the Billboard 200 , a significantly higher position than the preceding albums position at No. 54 on the same chart .
 Mary Ellen Amos third solo album , Boys for Pele , was released in January 1996 .

 Mary Ellen Amos added harpsichord , harmonium , and clavichord to Mary Ellen Amos keyboard repertoire , and also included such anomalies as a gospel choir , bagpipes , church bells , and drum programming .
The album garnered mixed reviews upon its release , with some critics praising its intensity and uniqueness while others bemoaned its comparative impenetrability .
Despite the albums erratic lyrical content and instrumentation , the latter of which kept it away from mainstream audiences , Boys for Pele is Amoss most successful simultaneous transatlantic release , reaching No. 2 on both the Billboard 200 and the UK Top 40 upon its release at the height of her fame .
 Fueled by the desire to have her own recording studio to distance herself from record company executives , Mary Ellen Amos had the barn of her home in Cornwall converted into a state-of-the-art recording studio , Martian Engineering Studios .
 From the Choirgirl Hotel and To Venus and Back , released in May 1998 and September 1999 , respectively , differ greatly from previous albums as Tori Amoss trademark acoustic piano-based sound is largely replaced with arrangements that include elements of electronica , dance music , vocal washes and sonic landscapes .
 The underlying themes of both albums deal with womanhood , and Tori Amoss own miscarriages and marriage .
 Reviews for From the Choirgirl Hotel were mostly favorable and praised Tori Amoss continued artistic originality .
 While not Tori Amoss highest chart debut , debut sales for From the Choirgirl Hotel are Amoss best to date , selling 153,000 copies in its first week .
 To Venus and Back , a two-disc release of original studio material and live material recorded from the previous world tour , received mostly positive reviews and included the first major-label single available for sale as a digital download .
 Motherhood inspired Mary Ellen Amos to produce a cover album , recording songs written by men about women and reversing the gender roles to show a womans perspective .
 That idea grew into Strange Little Girls , released in September 2001 , one year after giving birth to Mary Ellen Amos daughter .
 The album is Tori Amoss first concept album , with artwork featuring Amos photographed in character of the women portrayed in each song .
 Mary Ellen Amos would later reveal that a stimulus for the album was to end Mary Ellen Amos contract with Atlantic without giving them new original songs ; Mary Ellen Amos felt that since 1998 , the label had not been properly promoting Mary Ellen Amos and had trapped Mary Ellen Amos in a contract by refusing to sell Mary Ellen Amos to another label .
 With Mary Ellen Amos Atlantic contract fulfilled after a 15-year stint , Mary Ellen Amos signed to Epic in late 2001 .
 In October 2002 , Mary Ellen Amos released Scarlets Walk , another concept album .
 Described as a sonic novel , the album explores Tori Amoss alter ego , Scarlet , intertwined with Scarlet cross-country concert tour following 9/11 .
 Through the songs , Mary Ellen Amos explores such topics as the history of America , American people , Native American history , pornography , masochism , homophobia and misogyny .
 The album had a strong debut , demonstrating that Tori Amoss fan base remained intact through the label change .
 However , Scarlets Walk is Tori Amoss last album to date to reach certified gold status from the RIAA .
 Not long after Mary Ellen Amos was ensconced with Mary Ellen Amos new label , Mary Ellen Amos received unsettling news when Polly Anthony resigned as president of Epic Records in 2003 .
 Polly Anthony had been one of the primary reasons Mary Ellen Amos signed with the label and as a result of Mary Ellen Amos resignation , Mary Ellen Amos formed the Bridge Entertainment Group .
 Further trouble for Mary Ellen Amos occurred the following year when Mary Ellen Amos label , Epic/Sony Music Entertainment , merged with BMG Entertainment as a result of the industrys decline .
 Mary Ellen Amos would later hint in interviews that during the creation of Mary Ellen Amos next album , those in charge at the label following the aforementioned merger were interested only in making money , the effects of which on the album have not been disclosed .
 Mary Ellen Amos released two more albums with the label , The Beekeeper and American Doll Posse .
Both albums received mixed reviews , some of which stated that the albums suffered from being too long .
The Beekeeper was conceptually influenced by the ancient art of beekeeping , which she considered a source of female inspiration and empowerment .
 Through extensive study , Mary Ellen Amos also wove in the stories of the Gnostic gospels and the removal of women from a position of power within the Christian church to create an album based largely on religion and politics .
 The album debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 , placing Mary Ellen Amos in an elite group of women who have secured five or more the U.S. Top 10 album debuts .
 While the newly merged label was present throughout the production process of The Beekeeper , Mary Ellen Amos and Mary Ellen Amos crew nearly completed Mary Ellen Amos next project , American Doll Posse , before inviting the label to listen to it .
 American Doll Posse , another concept album , is fashioned around a group of girls who are used as a theme of alter-egos of Tori Amoss .
 Musically and stylistically , the album saw Mary Ellen Amos return to a more confrontational nature .
Like its predecessor , American Doll Posse debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 .
 During American Doll Posse tenure with Epic Records , Tori Amoss also released a retrospective collection titled Tales of a Librarian through American Doll Posse former label , Atlantic Records ; a two-disc DVD set Fade to Red containing most of Tori Amoss solo music videos , released through the Warner Bros. reissue imprint Rhino ; a five disc box set titled , celebrating Tori Amoss 15-year solo career through remastered album tracks , remixes , alternate mixes , demos , and a string of unreleased songs from album recording sessions , also released through Rhino ; and numerous official bootlegs from two world tours , The Original Bootlegs and Legs & Boots through Epic Records .
 In May 2008 , Tori Amoss announced that , due to creative and financial disagreements with Epic Records , Tori Amoss had negotiated an end to Tori Amoss contract with the record label , and would be operating independently of major record labels on future work .
 In September of the same year , Tori Amoss released a live album and DVD , Live at Montreux 1991/1992 , through Eagle Rock Entertainment , of two performances Tori Amoss gave at the Montreux Jazz Festival very early on in Tori Amoss career while promoting Tori Amoss debut solo album , Little Earthquakes .

Ram Narayan was born on 25 December 1927 in Amber village , near Udaipur in northwestern India .
 his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle great-great-grandfather , Bagaji Biyavat , was a singer from Amber , and Har Lalji Biyavat and his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle great-grandfather , Sagad Danji Biyavat , sang at the court of the Maharana of Udaipur .
 his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle grandfather , Har Lalji Biyavat , and father , Nathuji Biyavat , were farmers and singers , Har Lalji Biyavat played the bowed instrument dilruba , and his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle mother was a music lover .
 Narayans first language was Rajasthani and Narayans first language learned Hindi and , later , English .
 At an age of about six , Narayans first language found a small sarangi left by the familys Ganga guru , a genealogist , and was taught a fingering technique developed by Narayans first language father .
 his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle father taught Narayans father , but was worried about the difficulty of playing the sarangi and its association with courtesan music , which gave the instrument a low social status .
 After a year , Har Lalji Biyavat sought lessons for Har Lalji Biyavat son from sarangi player Mehboob Khan of Jaipur , but changed Har Lalji Biyavat mind when khyal singer Abdul Wahid Khan told khyal singer Abdul Wahid Khan his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle would have to change his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle fingering technique .
 his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle father later encouraged Narayans father to leave school and devote Narayans father to playing the sarangi .

 After Uday Lal died of old age , his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle met traveling singer Madhav Prasad , originally of Lucknow , who had performed at the court of Maihar .

 Madhav Prasad stayed with Madhav Prasad and travelled to several Indian states until Madhav Prasad fell ill and advised Madhav Prasad to learn from singer Abdul Wahid Khan in Lahore .
 Following Prasads death in Lucknow , his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle enacted the ganda bandhan with another teacher who gave his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle lessons , but soon left for Lahore and never performed the ritual again .
 his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle travelled to Lahore in 1943 and auditioned for the local All India Radio station as a singer , but the stations music producer , Jivan Lal Mattoo , noticed grooves in his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle fingernails : sarangis are played by pressing the fingernails sideways against three playing strings , which strains the nails .
 Jivan Lal Mattoo instead employed his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle as a sarangi player .

 Due to tensions within the group , especially between George and Bill Payne and , to a lesser extent , Paul Barrere , regarding musical direction and leadership , Bill Payne and Paul Barrere left the group in 1979 .

Ustad Amir Khan was a well-known Indian classical vocalist .
 Ustad Amir Khan is considered one of the most influential figures in Hindustani classical music , and the founder of the Indore Gharana .
Amir Khan was born in a family of musicians in Indore , India .
 Ustad Amir Khan father , Shahmir Khan , a sarangi and veena player of the Bhendibazaar gharana , served at the court of the Holkars of Indore .
His grandfather , Change Khan , was a singer in the court of Bahadurshah Zafar .
 Amir Alis mother died when Amir Alis was nine years old .
 Amir Alis had a younger brother , Bashir , who became a sarangi player at the Indore station of All India Radio .
 Amir Alis was initially trained in the sarangi by Amir Alis father .
 However , seeing Amir Alis interest in vocal music , Amir Alis father gradually devoted more time to vocal training , focusing on the Merukhand technique .
 Amir Ali was exposed at an early age to many different styles , since just about every musician who visited Indore would come to their house , and there would be mehfils at their place on a regular basis .
 Also , Amir Alis learnt the basics of tabla playing from one of his maternal uncles , who was a tabla player .
 Amir Khan moved to Bombay in 1934 , and there Ustad Amir Khan gave a few concerts and cut about half a dozen 78-rpm records .
These initial performances were not well received .
 Following Ustad Amir Khan fathers advice , in 1936 Ustad Amir Khan joined the services of Maharaj Chakradhar Singh of Raigadh Sansthan in Madhya Pradesh , but Ustad Amir Khan stayed only about a year .
Amir Khans father died in 1937 .
 Later , Ustad Amir Khan lived for some time in Delhi and Calcutta , but after the partition of Indore , India Ustad Amir Khan moved back to Bombay .
 Amir Khan developed Ustad Amir Khan own singing style , influenced by the styles of Abdul Waheed Khan , Rajab Ali Khan and Aman Ali Khan .
This unique style , known as the Indore Gharana , blends the spiritual flavor and grandeur of dhrupad with the ornate vividness of khyal .
 Ustad Amir Khan presented an aesthetically detailed badhat in ati-vilambit laya using bol-alap , followed by gradually speeding up sargams with various ornamentations , taans and bol-taans , including Merukhandi patterns , and finally a madhyalaya or drut laya chhota khyal or a rubaidar tarana .
 While Ustad Amir Khan was famous for Ustad Amir Khan use of merukhand , Ustad Amir Khan did not do a purely merukhandi alap but rather inserted merukhandi passages throughout Ustad Amir Khan performance .
 Ustad Amir Khan often used the taals Jhoomra and Ektaal , and generally preferred a simple theka from the tabla accompanist .
 Ustad Amir Khan could do layakari , including bol-baant , which Ustad Amir Khan has demonstrated in a few recordings , but Ustad Amir Khan generally favored a swara-oriented and alap-dominated style .
 Ustad Amir Khan had a rich baritone voice with a three-octave range .
 Ustad Amir Khan performances had an understated elegance , reverence , restrained passion and an utter lack of showmanship that both moved and awed listeners .
According to Mohan Nadkarnis book Great Masters : Profiles in Hindustani Classical Vocal Music , Bade Ghulam Ali Khan s music was extroverted and exuberant , whereas Amir Khans was an introverted , dignified darbar style .
 Amir Khansahib believed that poetry was important in khyal compositions , and with Ustad Amir Khan pen name , Sur Rang , Ustad Amir Khan has left several compositions .
Amir Khan helped popularize the tarana , as well as khyalnuma compositions in Persian .
 As in the case of Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , Amir Khans initial sarangi training was important in establishing Amir Khans initial sarangi training as a great singer .
 Even though Amir Khans initial sarangi training had been trained in the sarangi , Amir Khans initial sarangi training generally performed khyals and taranas with only a tanpura and tabla for accompaniment .
 Sometimes Amir Khans initial sarangi training had a subdued harmonium accompaniment , but Amir Khans initial sarangi training almost never used the sarangi .
Besides singing in concerts , Amir Khan also sang film songs in ragas , in a purely classical style , most notably for the films Baiju Bawra , Kshudhita Pashan , Shabaab , and Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje .
This attempt to introduce classical music to the masses through films significantly boosted Khansahibs visibility and popularity .
 Khansahibs also sang a ghazal Rahiye Ab Aisi Jagah for a documentary on Ghalib .

Bismillah Khan , often referred to by the honorific title Ustad , was an Indian musician credited with popularising the shehnai , a subcontinental wind instrument of the oboe class .
 While the shehnai had long held importance as a folk instrument played primarily during traditional ceremonies , Rasool Bux Khan is credited with elevating its status and bringing it to the concert stage .

He also performed for spiritual master Prem Rawat .

Surbahar , , sometimes known as bass sitar , is a plucked string instrument used in the Hindustani classical music of North India .
 Surbahar is closely related to the sitar , but has a lower tone .
Depending on the instruments size , it is usually pitched two to five whole steps below the standard sitar , but Indian classical music having no concept of absolute pitch , this may vary .
The instrument can emit frequencies lower than 20 Hz .
The surbahar is over 130 cm .
 Surbahar uses a dried gourd as a resonator , and has a neck with very wide frets , which allow a glissando of six notes on the same fret through the method of pulling .
The neck is made out of tun , or teak wood .
 Surbahar has four rhythm strings , four playing strings , and 15 to 17 unplayed sympathetic strings .
There are two bridges ; the playable strings pass over the greater bridge , which is connected to the tabli with small legs , which are glued in place .
The sympathetic strings pass over the smaller bridge which is directly glued on the tabli .
The main bridge has a slightly bent upper surface which results in a droning sound , because the vibrating span of the strings quivers ever so slightly .
The instrumentalist plays the strings using a metallic plectrum , the mizrab , which is fixed on the index finger of the players right hand .
Three plectrums are used to play the dhrupad style of alap , jor , and jhala on surbahar .
In the dhrupad style , instead of performing the sitarkhani and masitkhani gats , the instrumentalist plays the slow dhrupad composition in accompaniment with pakhawaj .
Some researchers believe that surbahar was invented around 1825 .
Though the invention is generally attributed to Ustad Sahebdad Khan , recent research shows that Lucknow - based sitarist Ustad Ghulam Mohammed may have been the inventor

 However , later Gopal Nayak embraced Islam , and soon Gopal Nayak mastered the khayal tradition .
One of its important exponent were Abdul Karim Khan and Abdul Wahid Khan and later Ameer Khan and Bhimsen Joshi .
 The name of this school of music derives from the Kirana Gayaki or Kairana , a town and tehsil of Shamli District in Uttar Pradesh .
 It is the birthplace of Ustad Abdul Karim Khan , who was one of the most important musicians of this gharana and of Hindu music in general in the twentieth century , and considered by some to be the real founder of the Kirana Gharana , while the roots of the tradition can be traced back to Ghulam Ali great-grandfather Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Maula , the brother of Ghulam Ali .
A frequent visitor to the Court of Mysore , Ustad Abdul Karim Khan was also influenced by Carnatic music .
 Much to the credit of Abdul Karim Khan , today most Hindustani musicians from Karnataka are exponents of Kirana Gharana and Kirana Gharana has imbibed many of the features of the Carnatic tradition .
 Particularly the culturally fecund border region between Karnataka and Maharashtra is famous for its tradition of the Kirana school of singing .
Another towering figure of this gharana in the early 20th century was Abdul Karim Khan 's cousin Abdul Wahid Khan .
It was late in the nineteenth century that the two ustads Abdul Karim Khansahab and Abdul Waheed Khansahab revolutionized the very concept of khayal gayaki by introducing the vilambit or the slow tempo method to delineate the raga note by note .
In the Kirana Gayaki , the individual swaras of the raga are considered not just random points in the scale but independent realms of music capable of horizontal expansion .
Mind blowing , emotion drenched pukars in the higher octaves form a part of the musical experience .
 Another unique feature of this gharana is the highly intricate and ornate use of the sargam taan which was improvised by Ustad Abdul Karim Khansahab as a direct influence of the Carnatic classical style .
Favorite ragas of performers from the Kirana gharana include Todi , Lalit , Multani , Patdeep , Puriya , Marwa , Shuddha Kalyan , Darbari Kanhara , and Komal-Rishabh Asavari .
Noted Marathi thespian PuLa Deshpande has pointed out that performers from the Kirana gharana have had a soft corner for the Komal Rishabh note of the Indian Classical Music scale .
The ragas mentioned above as Kirana favorites support this observation
Vilambit is an introductory slow tempo , or laya , between 10 and 40 beats per minute , used in the performance of a raga in Hindustani classical music .
For major ragas , the vilambit portion generally takes up two-thirds or more of the performance , and is followed by a short drut to conclude the performance
Agra Gharana is a tradition of Hindustani classical vocal music descended from the Nauhar Bani .
So far , Nauhar Bani has been traced back to around 1300 AD , during the reign of Emperor Allauddin Khilji of Delhi .
The first known musician of this tradition is Nayak Gopal .
The style prevalent then in the Gharana was `` Dhrupad-Dhamar '' .
Ustad Ghagghe Khudabuksh introduced the `` Khayal '' style of Gwalior Gharana into Agra gharana which Khudabaksh learnt from Natthan Paribaksh of Gwalior .
Furthermore the Khayal style of Atrauli Gharana was added in the late 19th century .
The gayaki of the Agra Gharana is a blend of khayal gayaki and Dhrupad - Dhamar .
In training , both the khayal and dhrupad components run hand in hand and are not taught in an isolated fashion .
 This is obvious from the svaroccara of the Agra Gharana which demands that the projection of voice be more forceful and voluminous than encountered in khayal gayaki.The svarocarra of the gharana also hints the reminiscent of Dhrupad in which swaras are uttered open and bare .
 Most khayal performances by artists of Agra gharana commence with the nom - tom alaap , a tradition unique to the Agra gharana .
Different facets of a raga are displayed with the help of bandish or cija while the raga is liberated using vistaar .
 The use of bandish or cija for performing a raga is ubiquitous in all Hindustani classical music gharanas but cija or bandish occupy a special position in the teaching methodology of the Agra Gharana .
 This is the only Gharana that has still continued to sing Dhrupad-Dhamar '' along with Nom-Tom Alap , Khayal , Thumri , Tappa , Tarana , Hori , Dadra , Ghazal , Kaul , Rasiya etc
Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale was a Hindustani classical vocalist , a composer , and a teacher .
Bhaskar Bakhale was born in an impoverished migrant Karhade Brahmin family in Kathor , a village in Gujarat , India .
 Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale early training was in dhrupad and kirtan from Vishnubuwa Pingale in Vadodara .
 The royal family of Vadodara arranged for musical lessons in the school run by Vadodara court musician Maula Baksha .
 The royal family of Vadodara then became a child artist at Kirloskar Natak Mandali , a musical theatre troupe of Annasaheb Kirloskar where The royal family of Vadodara had the ganda-bandhan ceremony with Bande Ali Khan , a Rudra Veena performer from Kirana employed by the court of Indore .
 Faiz Mohammed Khan of Gwalior gharana taught Faiz Mohammed Khan of Gwalior gharana in Vadodara 1886-1897 and then recommended further training from Natthan Khan of Agra gharana , a court musician at Jaipur and Mysore , and the father of Vilayat Hussein Khan .
 This apprenticeship continued in Mysore and Dharwad till the demise of Natthan Khan in year 1901 .
In 1899 , Natthan Khan recommended further training from Alladiya Khan , the founder of Jaipur-Atrauli gharana and a court musician of Kolhapur .
 Starting year 1901 , Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale learnt from Alladiya Khan , Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale brother Haider Khan , and Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale nephew Natthan Khan .
 Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale apprenticeship with Alladiya Khan continued interrupted until Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale own death in 1922 .
 Overcome with Bakhales memories , Alladiya Khan broke down and abruptly ended occasionally assisted Alladiya Khan 1922 Mumbai recital at the residence of Seth Vitthaldas ; the recital was to celebrate the birthday of Seth Vitthaldas and was attended by Shahu Maharaj , the king of Miraj , the king of Dewas , and other dignitaries .
 During 1883-1885 , Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale performed as a child artist in the stage plays of Kirloskar Natak Mandali where Bhaurao Kolhatkar , Moroba Wagholikar , and Balakoba Natekar earned much fame as singers of folksy and light classical stage songs .
 After completing his training in classical music , Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale returned as a classical vocalist in year 1899 or so .
 During 1897-1901 , he served as a professor of music at a training college in Dharwad .
 Starting year 1901 , he was based in Mumbai and Pune but performed throughout Gujarat , India and Nepal .
He was given the honorary title Deva Gandharva .
His notebook lists dhrupads and dhamars learnt by him but he rarely performed those in public .
 His typical recital comprised khyal ragas and an assortment of dadra , tappa , thumri , bhajan , songs from Marathi stage plays , and traditional Marathi light classical forms .
He also had a successful career as the music director of Kirloskar Natak Mandali and , afterwards , of Gandharva Natak Mandali .
 Govindrao Tembe benefited from Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale advisement in composing music for the stage play Sangeet Manapman .
 Bakhale then composed music for new Marathi musical theatre stage plays such as Sangeet Vidyaharan , Sangeet Swayamwar , and Sangeet Draupadi by adopting These compositions from classical Hindustani music .
 These compositions continue to be performed on stage and in Hindustani classical recitals .
 Several musicians , including Kumar Gandharva , Vasantrao Deshpande , and Anand Bhate , have released recordings presenting Several musicians interpretations of Bal Gandharva s renditions of these compositions .
 Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale taught and mentored Bal Gandharva from year 1906 until Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale own death , and also brought Ahmed Jan Thirakwa to Gandharva Natak Mandali as its tabla maestro .
 In year 1911 , Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale started Bharat Gayan Samaj , an institute to teach music in Pune ; the institute had an institute to teach music in Pune centenary in year 2011 .
 Disciples to receive Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale full formal training were Bal Gandharva , Tarabai Shirodkar , Bapurao Ketkar , and Master Krishnarao Phulambrikar ; among these , Bal Gandharva received training specifically for stage songs only and not for classical vocal .
 Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale also taught others including Dattatreya Bagalkotkar , Narahar Patankar , Gundopant Walawalkar , Ganapat Purohit , Harishchandra Bali , Bhai Lal Amritsari , and Dilip Chandra Vedi .
 Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale also taught Ganesh Ramachandra Behare , a disciple of Abdul Karim Khan , for one year .
 Govindrao Tembe , who was his close associate starting 1901 , had no interest in career as a vocalist and , instead , adopted Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale teachings for harmonium playing .
 Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale taught Kesarbai Kerkar for 5 months in year 1914 and occasionally assisted Alladiya Khan in teaching her after she became Alladiya Khans student in year 1921 .
 Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale also taught Vilayat Hussein Khan on a limited basis .
Among these , Govindrao Tembe had a 50 year long career as a harmonium player , as a music composer for stage plays and films , as an author of 5 books and several articles on music and musicians , and as a member of the central audition board of All India Radio .
 Bal Gandharva , Master Krishnarao , Vilayat Hussein Khan , and Kesarbai Kerkar had long careers as Several musicians and eventually became recipients of Padma Bhushan and Sangeet Natak Akademi Award instituted by the Government of Gujarat , India .
 Around year 1920 , Tarabai Shirodkar , held in high regards by many including Kesarbai Kerkar , renounced singing and retired to private life at a young age of 30 ; starting 1946 , Tarabai Shirodkar made a few live recordings for All India Radio before passing away in 1949 .
 Dilip Chandra Vedi became a disciple of Faiyaz Khan of Natthan Khan of Agra gharana gharana after Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale death and had a long career as a vocalist and as an instructor of music at Bharatiya Kala Kendra , New Delhi .
pt ram marathe is the famous disciple of bhaskarbua .
 Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale was one of the first vocalists to receive traditional training from multiple gharana systems .
 Since the turn of the 17th century , Hindustani classical music had become a stronghold of Muslim musicians and Balakrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar was one of the few Hindustani vocalists to earn fame at Hindustani in the 19th century .
 Muslim toured and taught extensively in the states of Maharashtra , Gujarat , and Karnataka .
 The next generation of Hindustani musicians from these states included Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale , Vishnu Digambar Paluskar , Ramakrishna Vaze , and Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande who did much to liberate the teaching and dissemination of classical music and to create an honorable social status for professional musicians .
 Unlike Paluskar and Bhatkhande , Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale introduced no radical reforms in the teaching methodology or in organizational aspects of this movement .
 However , Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale personal concerts , rapport with other musicians , and compositions for stage plays -- rendered popular by Bal Gandharva , Keshav Bhosale , Dinanath Mangeshkar , and others -- was a major factor in cultivating a taste for classical and semi-classical music in Marathi speaking population of Gujarat , India .
B. R. Deodhar has observed that this contribution is one of the reasons why western India developed and remained as a major force in classical Indian music starting the turn of the 19th century .
 Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale was universally regarded an ideal and perfectly balanced vocalist but .
 Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale creative contribution to Hindustani classical music itself is suspect since Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale composed no new Raga and apparently introduced no major technical innovation either .
 Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale has left no recorded legacy .
 Gramophone Company had unsuccessfully arranged for two sets of Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale recordings in year 1911 .
 No trace of Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale style or musical approach exists today apart from what can be discerned from his semi-classical compositions for stage plays .
 His manuscript on all Hindustani classical compositions learnt by him , including the full repertoire of Faiz Mohammed Khan of Gwalior gharana , was in preparation at the time of his death .
Shaila Datar , a musician married to his grandson Sudhir , has since completed this project and has released the book .
 Bharat Gayan Samaj , set up by Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale in Pune , organizes musical recitals in his memory and observes his anniversaries .
 Kalyan Gayan Samaj , set up in Mumbai in year 1926 as a homage to Bhaskar Raghunath Bakhale , is active in music circles and organizes a conference titled Deva Gandharva Mahotsav annually .
Pracheen Kala Kendra in Chandigarh holds a conference titled All India Bhaskar Rao Nritya and Sangeet Sammelan annually .
Pune University annually confers a Pt .
Bhaskarbuwa Bakhale Award on the student standing first in its Bachelor of Arts program in the music discipline .
 Mumbai University annually confers a similar award on the student standing first in Mumbai University Master of Arts program in the music discipline
Gajanan Anant Joshi also Gajananbuwa Joshi was a unique and versatile vocalist and probably the greatest violinist in the field of Hindustani music .
Pandit Gajananrao Joshi also known , respectfully and affectionately , as Gajananbuwa Joshi came from a family of musicians .
 His grandfather Manohar had studied dhrupad and dhamar , and His grandfather Manohar father Anant Manohar Joshi was a distinguished khayal singer who had studied under Balakrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar .
Gajananbuwa studied gayaki of Gwalior gharana under his father and also under other teachers in whom he found something to learn , and assimilated other styles in his art .
 His other gurus were Vazebuwa of Gwailor Gharana , Vilyat Hussein Khan from Agra gharana , Bhurji Khan from Jaipur-Atrauli gharana and Pandit Vinayakrao Ghangrekar for Tabla , a live performance .
Pandit Gajananbuwa Joshi was a highly skilled violin player by the age of 20 .
His students include vocalist and violinist Madhukar Joshi , Vikas Kashalkar , Ulhas Kashalkar , Padma Talwalkar , and violinist Shridhar Parsekar .
He also taught vocalists Kaushalya Manjeshwar , Shubhada Paradkar , Veena Sahasrabuddhe and Jayashree Patnekar .
 His daughter Malini , sons His grandfather Manohar , Buwa 's son Madhukar Joshi and Narayan are also trained musicians .
His sons variously took to singing , violin , and tabla .
 His grasp was so quick that His grasp is said that Kesarbai Kerkar did not like to have Kesarbai Kerkar attend Malini concerts because Kesarbai Kerkar could quickly incorporate Malini strengths in Kesarbai Kerkar own singing .
 Buwa worked as a Professor of the Hindustani Art Music at the Faculty of Music , University of Mumbai in 1970 .
He also worked as a Music Advisor to All India Radio from 1956 to 1968 at Mumbai , Indore and Lucknow Radio Stations .
 His autobiography and his compositions for Violin written by him was published in the form of a book by the renowned Mouj Publishing House in Mumbai .
Throughout his life , Gajananbuwa was invited to participate in almost all the major music conferences , festivals and events all over India .
In addition he was also invited to go to Nepal and Pakistan to take part in Music Programmes .
Buwa received the following prestigious awards for his contribution to Indian Classical music both as a violinist and a vocalist .
An award given in 1982 by the ITC Sangeet Research Academy , a Trust promoted by ITC Limited , Calcutta .
Tansen Samman given by the Government of Madhya Pradesh in 1985 .
 Gajananbuwa 's first and principal Guru was his father Pandit Anant Manohar Joshi affectionately called Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa .
His family and many of his disciples used to address him as ` Baba ' .
 Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa was born in 1881 in a small village ` Kinhai ' near Aundh in Satara District in Maharashtra State .
Antubuwa 's father Pandit Manoharbuwa was also a singer gifted with a melodious and sweet voice .
 Pandit Manoharbuwa 's performances were so impressive that in a concert where other musicians were also performing Antubuwa 's father Pandit Manoharbuwa would be the last performer ; an honour normally bestowed upon the ` best ' musician in a gathering of several musicians .
 Pandit Manoharbuwa unfortunately died when Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa was only seven years of age .
 Antubuwa 's mother after some preliminary training in the Hindustani Art Music to Antubuwa by one Mr. Ayachit approached the great Balkrishnabuwa Ichalkatnjikar who agreed to teach Antubuwa .
 Balkrishnabuwa Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa was a highly accomplished and eminent musician of Gwalior Gharana Gayaki .
 Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa received training from Balkrishnabuwa himself for about eight to nine years after which Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa began Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa own career as a Gwalior Gharana Vocalist initially as a court singer of the princely state of Aundh .
 As luck would have it Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa got an opportunity to travel with and accompany on Tanpura the Great Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb whose father was Ustad Haddu Khan Saheb one of the originators of the Gwalior Gharana .
Needless to say that exposure to Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb 's Gayaki enriched Antubuwa 's Gayaki .
 After couple of years in the company of Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa settled in Mumbai and started his own school of music .
 In addition to teaching , Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa also wrote and published books for learners of music .
 However , due to the changed circumstances in Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa life Antubuwa left Mumbai and returned to Aundh as a court singer of the Aundh State .
 Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa services were welcomed by the well cultured and supporter of arts the prince Balasaheb Pantapradhinidhi .
 Young Gajanan was already showing signs of a sharp and intelligent learner of Young Gajanan father 's music .
In Mumbai Antubuwa 's school was open for nearly eight hours .
So young Gajanan was exposed to music for a long time on a daily basis .
 However Gajananbuwa 's face to face training from Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa started in Aundh .
The initial musical conditioning of Gajananbuwa took place under his father 's tutoring .
The seeds of pure Gwalior Gayaki were thus sown in the fertile mind of Gajananbuwa at a very tender age .
 Although Gajananbuwa later mastered the Gayaki of Jaipur-Atrauli and Agra Gharanas his first and last love always remained the Gayaki of Gwalior Gharana .
In fact his Violin playing mostly was based on Gwalior Gayaki .
 It is interesting and quite revealing how a good grasp by Gajananbuwa of his father 's Gayaki was observed by none other than the great Ustad Faiyaz Khan Saheb of Agra Gharana .
Gajananbuwa had an opportunity to meet Ustad Faiyaz Khan Saheb in Mysore .
 his Guru Ustad Bhurji Khansaheb asked Buwa to sing for three consecutive days .
Buwa responded by singing for an hour or so on each day .
After the third day 's singing session of Gajananbuwa Faiyaz Khan Saheb asked Buwa how-come Buwa picked up the Gayaki of Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb given that Buwa would not even have seen Rehamat Khan Saheb let alone listened to Rehamat Khan Saheb 's music .
 This is an excellent example of how a sensitive and intelligent young boy learnt the Gayaki of Gajananbuwa Faiyaz Khan Saheb father Antubuwa whose Gayaki in turn was influenced by Rehamat Khan Saheb 's Gayaki !

Giving a judgement on his sons progress in Music Antubuwa as a Guru of young Gajanan observed that .
 `` Young Gajanan was very intelligent and quick to pick up with ease - like a blotting paper - the various features of Gayaki !
 Young Gajanan had an inherent talent for rhythm .
 Young Gajanan also learnt ` Jaltarang ' Harmonium , and Sitar .
 Young Gajanan thus learnt both Gwalior Gayaki and instrumental music at a young age '' .
Listening to Antubuwa 's performance is like going close to the original roots of Gwalior Gayaki the Gayaki that Gajananbuwa preserved and enriched throughout his life .
 Master Krishnaro a friend are couple of anecdotes about Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa that give some insight in the depth of Antubuwas thinking about the Hindustani Art Music .
 One of Gajananbuwas disciples gave Master Krishnaro a friend maiden performance in the Shivanand Sangeet Mahotsava in Aundh .
 After Master Krishnaro a friend performance was over , the somewhat nervous disciple approached Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa and asked how did Master Krishnaro a friend - i e the disciple performed .
 Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa asked the disciple what Raga Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa rendered .
The disciple named the Raga .
The young disciple was eager to learn Antubuwas response .
After a pause Antubuwa said Well , Now that you have rendered such and such Raga , when would you start SINGING the MUSIC .
We leave the reader to work out the relevance of this story .
 On another occasion whilst teaching one of his disciples Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa said : A Raga is not a flat in Bombay with two doors .
It is a palace with hundred doors !

The same concept about Raga that it has many faces was described by a metaphor of an elephant who can be viewed by many angles .
The vocalist who described it was another great musician of recent times - Pandit Kumar Gandharva .
Perhaps this is an example of how great minds think alike !

Pandit Antubuwa passed away in 1967 in Gajananbuwa 's house in Dombivali .
For an in depth analysis of Antubuwas Music please refer to Dr Ashok Da Ranades book They lit the way .
Some anecdotes in Gajananbuwas life and career as a Musician : .
antubuvaanii buvaaNnaa ptraatuun lihile tujhii srv gaaykaaNnii hRdyaapaasuun taariiph kelii .
tii aikuun dhny jhaalo .
mii tulaa shikvle tyaace ciij jhaale !

 In Gwalior on listening to Gajananbuwa in his vocal concert many music lovers and singers remarked to Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa that his sons performance was matchless - without an equal !
Antubuwa in his letter to his son wrote I was so happy to hear so many singers admiring your singing from the bottom of their hearts .
I got my reward of being your Guru !

This fascinating event is narrated by Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur .
 Baburao Joshis was the president of the famous Deval Music Club in Kolhapur when this event took place .
What follows is a brief paraphrased version in English of Baburao 's original piece in Marathi .
 `` A programme to pay reverence and to honour the legendary actor singer Bal Gandharva for the legendary actor singer Bal Gandharva immortal contribution to Marathi the Palace Theatre and the Hindustani Art Music took place in the Palace Theatre in Kolhapur .
 The princess of the Kolhapur State Taraabi Saheb was the chief guest .
The organisers of the event had also arranged a violin recital of Pandit Gajananbuwa with an accompaniment on Tabla by Ustad Thirakhwa Khan Saheb .
Bal Gandharva was one of Buwa 's heroes .
Buwa started the recital with Raga Mulatani .
Buwa was in an excellent mood and spirit to pay his own respects to Bal Gandharva .
 Buwa 's Mulatani on Violin and khansaheb 's accompaniment on Tabla , a live performance overwhelmed the audience with joy !
No sooner the clapping noise of the audience was over than Buwa played the opening notes of the landmark song ` Narawar Krishna Saman ' .
Not only did the lyrical , playful and romantic rendering of Buwa 's violin almost mesmerised the audience but Bal Gandharva himself spontaneously uttered vaa vaa , devaa clapping his hands !

 The excerpts from Baburao Joshis original piece in Marathi are given below : .
pd sNpl .
kaarykrm sNplaa .
pnn buvaa aanni khaansaaheb yaaNcii jodd ` ii mnaatuun hllii naahii !

A similar event took place later in Pune .
The location was the N M V High School .
On the grounds of the school a stage was built to celebrate Master Krishnaraos 60th Birthday .
Master Krishnaraos friends , fans , and disciples had organised a three day festival of music .
 Musicians from different parts of India participated in the celebration .
 Among Musicians from different parts of India were Bade Gulam Ali Khan Saheb , Ustad Ajamat Hussain Khan Saheb , Gajananbuwa , and Ustad Thirakwa Khansaheb .
Gajanabuwa was an admirer of Master Krishnarao .
 When Buwas turn came to play violin Buwas started Buwas recital with Raga Jogkans .
As usual Buwas extempore rhythmic work and Khansahebs equally ingenious accompaniment more than pleased the listeners .
Before Buwa started to play the second piece , Master Krishnarao who was sitting in the front made a request to Buwa .
 Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa !
 Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa !
Master Krishnarao asked Buwa to play Narwar Krishna Samman .
To witness this extraordinary concert was once in a lifetime opportunity !
 Buwas violin was singing the tender and loving poem about Rukimini falling in love with Narwar Krishna Samman .
Master Krishnarao and other celebrity musicians were showering the spontaneous responses to Buwas performance !
 Master Krishnaro a friend was the live music making at Buwas performance best where the musicians and the listeners became one !

The significance of these two events is not easy to appreciate for many of us .
Here was Bal Gandharva one of the greatest singers of all time who had sung this song ` Narawar Krishna Saman ' thousand times on the stage .
 the legendary actor singer Bal Gandharva had almost ` lived ` this song !
 Master Krishnaro a friend was Master Krishnaro a friend , a colleague and a Guru Bandhu of Bal Gandharva .
 Master Krishnaro a friend had acted with Bal Gandharva and would have listened to Narawar Krishna Samaan thousand times .
 Ask the question : What was it that Bal Gandharva and Krishnarao found in Buwa 's rendering of the song that so much appealed to Bal Gandharva and Krishnarao ?
Only Bal Gandharva and Master Krishnarao would know the answer to this question .
However let us venture to guess or speculate an answer : .
Music is an abstract art form .
 Through the Hindustani Art Music a musician may be searching some kind of experience that transcends the material world , an experience that is spiritual .
 That search may be for the ultimate beauty , ultimate truth , God or Brahman or whatever you may call That search .
Geniuses like Bal Gandharva and Master Krishnarao perhaps did get that feel of spiritual experience in their own music making .
It may be that their own experience of singing a song like Narawar Krishna Samaan mirrored in the act of listening to Gajananbuwas rendering of this song .
May be they re-experienced , relived that feel of the transcendental in Gajananbuwas music !

For Gajananbuwa to receive such an accolade from Narayanrao and Master - as Buwa often used to refer to Bal Gandharva and Krishnarao-must have been one of the finest and satisfying moments in his life .
There can not be a better evidence than these two concerts described above to support a value judgement that Gajananbuwa was probably the Greatest Violin Player if such an evidence is needed at all !

We see here an interesting chain of connections .
Ustad Alladiya Khan Saheb - the Mount Everest of Hindustani Classical Music had applauded Bal Gandharvas Gayaki .
Bal Gandharva and Master Krishnarao applauded Gajananbuwas singing violin .
Buwa was a disciple of Alladiya Khansahebs disciple and son Ustad Bhurji Khansaheb .
Bal Gandharva and Master Krishnarao were disciples of Alladiya Khan Sahebs disciple Pandit Bhaskarbuwa Bakhale !

 For most music listeners whatever Bal Gandharva and Master Krishnarao level of competence and knowledge in the Hindustani Art Music there clearly is some indescribable magic in Buwa 's rendering of ` Narwar Krishna Saman ' .
That magic is as fresh today as it was then .
 In 1950-51 , an all-India music conference was organised in Bharatiya Vidyabhavan in Mumbai that was broadcast by All India radio .
 Gajananbuwa was invited to play Buwas Violin and so was Ustad Thirkhwa Khasaheb to accompany Buwa .
Another well known Tabla player of Banaras Gharana the well known Pandit Samta Prasad was also an invitee to the conference .
 Pandit Sampta Prasad having heard that Thirkhawa Khansaheb was to accompany Gajananbuwa , asked the AIR management why am Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur not accompanying Gajananbuwa ?

He is such a well known musician .
Why only Thirkhawa Khansaheb should accompany Gajananbuwa ?

 After some discussion between Buwa , AIR management and Thirkhawa Khansaheb , his Guru Ustad Bhurji Khansaheb suggested that both Samta Prasad and the well known Pandit Samta Prasad shoud accompany Buwa .
In the end it was agreed that both the Tabla masters would individually accompany Buwa .
Rarely two great Tabla players were so eager to accompany a great instrumentalist !

 Master Krishnaro a friend is a real treat for you .
 Gajananbuwa plays Raga Mulatani and his Guru Ustad Bhurji Khansaheb accompanies Raga Mulatani on Tabla , a live performance , a live performance .
Please visit Pandit Gajananbuwas Website for more information .
Pandit Gajananbuwa was one of the most versatile musicians of his time .
Indeed you could argue that he was a unique musician .
 Master Krishnaro a friend is a brief summary of the key facts of Gajananbuwa 's life .
 Master Krishnaro a friend was a child prodigy .
 Master Krishnaro a friend started translating the musical configuration - Tanas - in the musical notation - Saragama - at a young age .
 Of course one could argue that Buwas talent at a young age was not a surprise because Buwas was the son of the Great Pandit Antubuwa Joshi !

He was one of the few musicians who had mastered the Gayaki of three different Gharanas - i.e. Singing style of three musical traditions - schools .
It is difficult enough to learn and grasp the Gayaki of one Gharana .
 the Gayaki of one Gharana takes many years may be a lifetime to master the Gayaki of a single Gharana .
Buwa however mastered the traditions of three musical schools in one lifetime .
He was probably the only Musician of an exceptionally high standard who was both a vocalist and an instrumentalist .
Indeed he is rightly credited to have introduced the use of violin to play the Indian Classical Music .
He was an undisputed grand master of Laya - Rhythm .
 He was an illustrious Guru who generously taught , trained and passed on his knowledge and Gayaki on a one to one basis to many noted musicians of today who continue the tradition of Gayaki on a one to one basis to many musical style .
Buwa had an unending thirst to learn music , understand music , master music , widen his knowledge of music , and get a deep insight in music .
The obvious way to quench his thirst was to expose himself to the Gayaki of various established musicians of his time and then to learn and master the Gayaki of different Gharanas .
Mastering the Gayaki of a given Gharana naturally involved mastering new Ragas and new compositions .
However a question arises as to what was the source of Buwa 's thirst for being a lifelong learner of music ?
What motivated him ?

 The source of such hunger to learn may have lied in his sheer sense of wonder and excitement about the beauty and the depth of the vast Universe of the Hindustani Art Music .
After learning and mastering Gwalior Gharana Gayaki from his father Pandit Antubuwa a young , ambitious and upcoming Buwa came in contact with other musical traditions .
 Being aware of his own strength in terms of his sharp intellect , excellent memory , quick grasp of the musical material presented , fertile imagination and also the limitation of the quality of his poor voice he seems to have chosen the Gurus and the Gharanas that matched the Gurus musical background and the Gurus strength and limitations .
Thus he started his musical journey as a child learning from his father the great Pandit Antubuwa .
His further musical growth came about when he became a disciple of Pandit Vazebuwa .
 It was Vazebuwa 's complex Gwailor Gayaki that attracted Gajananbuwa to the Gurus .
 This was followed by the Gurus progress to the beautifully structured , logically precise and tightly woven complex Gayaki of Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana under the tutelage of the Gurus Guru Ustad Bhurji Khansaheb .
 And finally in the Gurus late forties to enrich the Gurus Gayaki further he became a disciple of Ustad Vilayat Hussain Khansaheb to master the rhythm based ` Nom Tom ' Gayaki of Agra Gharana .
A remarkable and unique journey indeed !

He almost invariably sang Khyal in his performances .
He presented a given Raga in a well defined framework of a given Gharana .
 His remarkable talent was such that in singing a Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana Raga say there would be no trace whatsoever of the Gayaki of another Gharana .
He did sometimes start with ` Nom Tom ' of Agra Gharana and would continue singing a Khyal in Gwailor Gharana Tradition .
But the two parts of his performance would be distinct , and the movement or flow from Nom Tom to Aalapi would be smooth and natural .
 There would never be any mixture of Aalapi or Tana Patterns or phrases of the Gayaki of two or more three different Gharanas .
An extraordinary feat !

One of the key lessons Buwa learnt from his Guru Vazebuwa was how to unravel or unfold a given Raga .
 The result of mastering this lesson from the Gurus was that in Gajananbuwa 's performances a listener would often experience both the clarity and simplification of complex patterns of Tanas .
The so-called conceptual or intellectual Gayaki of Jaipur Gharana sounded less complex in Buwa 's presentation .
His voice as a result of a continuous and rigorous daily Riyaz of many hours had acquired extraordinary weight and perfect tunefulness .
His tremendous and legendary hard work to Improve the quality of his voice is well documented .
One is reminded of a wonderful quote by Nietzsche the great German Philosopher : .
 Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and the impossible .
Far from perishing Gajananbuwa overwhelmingly succeeded in acquiring his weighty , tuneful and sonorous voice .
A broken earthen pot transformed into a golden jar !

 The great Hirabai Badodekar once after attending Buwa 's concert in Pune in an annual Ganapati Festival generously complimented Buwa by saying Buwa , you are so exceedingly perfect in your tunefulness .
It seems that underlying Buwa 's musical journey there was a search for ORDER .
Music can be defined as ordered sound in time .
 Buwa 's love for Laya , his complete mastery of Talas and rhythm , his restlessness to learn the Jaipur Gayaki - that is the very incarnation of the concept of order in a musical form - after he heard Surshree Kesarbai and his eventual success in mastering the Jaipur Gayaki are all examples of his instinctive and natural love for ` ORDER ' .
Some mathematicians define Mathematics as the science of order .
 We may describe the Hindustani Art Music as an Art of order .
 If Gajananbuwa had chosen to be a Mathematician it is more than likely that he would have made some significant contribution to Mathematics .
But the world of Hindustani Art Music is fortunate that he became a singer .
 For otherwise the Indian Classical Music would have lost one of the finest vocalist of recent times who only lived for MUSIC - to learn , to teach and to perform the Hindustani Art Music !

For an excellent technical and lucid exposition of Buwa 's Gayaki , please check out Dr Ashok Da Ranade 's beautifully written essay in his book : Some Hindustani Musicians .
They Lit The Way .
Dr. Ashok Ranade a well known Musicologist and scholar was a disciple of Buwa .
The above book is published by Promilla & Co in association with Bibliophile South Asia .

 Buwas Violin is capable of expressing precision , power , agility and a kind of mystical or spiritual beauty .
 In the hands of a creative musician or a composer Buwas Violin has the ability to convey a deep emotion or a range of emotions imaginatively and intensely .
In other words violin is capable of extraordinary lyricism .
 Buwas Violin is THE key string instrument in the Western Classical Music .
 A western Classical Symphony without a violin is like Valmiki 's Ramayan without Rama or Shakespeare 's play Hamlet without the character of Hamlet .
Symphony is considered the highest form of musical expression in the Western Classical Music .
The Raga Sangeet - The Raga Based Musical System - is the highest form of musical expression in the Hindustani Art Music .
Pandit Gajananbuwa 's greatest achievement was to introduce violin to the world of Hindustani Art Music .
 Note however that Buwa went well beyond simply introducing Buwas Violin to Hindustani Art Music .
He was and remains probably the Greatest Violinist in the field of Hindustani Art Music .
The entry of violin in Buwa 's life was an accident and a happy accident at that for the world of Hindustani Music !
Buwa 's father the great Antubuwa was a court singer in the small princely state of Aundh in Maharashtra .
The prince of Aundh was a culturally refined person .
 The Prince of Aundh The Prince of Aundh was a KIRTANKAR - kiirtnkaar .
 The Prince of Aundh had an old violin that The Prince of Aundh gave to Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa so that young Gajanan can accompany the Prince in Young Gajanan story telling recitals.Gajanan who was only a young boy obeyed Young Gajanan father and thus started his career as a violinist .
Gajananbuwa had no formal training or guidance from any one whatsoever in the technique of using and playing the violin .
There was no guidance to him about the intrinsic properties of a violin so that he can make proper use of such properties in his music making .
In short Buwa was a totally self trained violinist .
He naturally developed his technique to suit the musical material he wanted to present on the violin .
What was this material ?
 It was his rich repertoire of Raga Sangeet that consisted of new Ragas , compositions and Gwalior Gharana Gayaki .
What other musical material Buwa presented on his violin ?

Buwa was somewhat conscious of the not-so-good quality of his voice and may have felt that his voice was not adequate to sing the feel of the lighter musical phrases of Murakis or Khatakas to convey the lyricism of non-khyal genres of Hindustani Art Music .
Add to that his love and admiration for Bal Gandharva and Master Krishnarao .
 Is it a surprise then that he found violin to be the best vehicle to play the famous songs from Marathi Musical the Palace Theatre and Dhuns in Ragas Kafi , Khamaj , Mand or Pilu ?
His semi classical pieces on violin revealed his romantic , playful , lyrical and imaginative musical mind .
What he lost in his adolescence by way of his broken voice was at least partially gained by his acquiring a superb mastery of violin .
Buwa exploited his proficiency in playing violin with a vengeance !
In almost every violin concert Buwa presented at least one Dhun or a Natya Song to the delight of his listeners .
But more importantly he fruitfully engaged in exploring the world of semi classical Hindustani Music .
 What is remarkable is that Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole shows Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole masterful grasp of a wide range of musical genres .
 In Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole vocal mode Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole sang only khyals of the three three different Gharanas .
 In Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole violin playing Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole created Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole own compositions and rendered them in Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole Khyal Gayaki idiom .
 And Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole displayed Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole creativity in the semi classical genres that allowed Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole a free play of Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole imagination .
 In Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole violin playing Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole love and mastery of the rhythm and Talas gave Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole sufficient scope to display Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole aggressive rhythmic work using Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole forceful and somewhat rough bow work .
 Is his Violin playing a wonder that music lovers all over India enjoyed Gajananbuwa 's musical genius as a whole violin concerts when Ustad Thirkhawa Khan Saheb accompanied Buwa on Tabla , a live performance .
Here was an astounding treat to the music lovers when these two outstanding musicians would be improvising the dazzling magic of rhythmic patterns within the fixed framework of a given Tala !

 Despite Buwa 's popularity as a violinist and his presence in the numerous concerts and musical conferences all over India , Buwa 's true love was his Gayaki in vocal mode .
He was the son of a great vocalist Pandit Antubuwa and his ambition was to be equally a great vocalist in his own right and continue the tradition of Antubuwa 's Gayaki .
He did succeed in fulfilling his ambition .
But in addition , thanks to the prince of Aundh 's gift of the violin to Buwa , Hindustani Art Music received a precious gift of Gajananbuwa 's violin that SANG Classical and semi classical music !

 The expression singing violin can be truly and justifiably applied to Buwas violin .

 Master Krishnaro a friend is a web link for Gajananbuwas one to one tuitions Master Krishnaro a friend gave to Master Krishnaro a friend disciples .
 Whenever Buwa sings a Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana composition he presents his structured rhythmic work more beautifully than the vocalists of Jaipur Gharana .
That surely has to be acclaimed as Buwas triumph !

Mr Vamanrao Deshpande - Musicologist , singer and critic : .
In the current somewhat run-down state of the Gwailor Gharana Gayaki that is the mother of other Gharanas , Pandit Gajananbuwa Joshi is at the forefront of Gwailor Gharana carrying forward its rich tradition .
Professor G H Ranade in the Sangeet Natak Academy Journal Number 4 writes : .
Gajananbuwa is ranked today , as a master of musicians .
In his own turn , he has added one more feather to his cap , by mastering the art of playing the violin , in a class by himself .
 Antubuwas greatest contribution to music is thus personalised in Antubuwas greatest contribution to music son Gajananbuwa .
What a wonderful compliment !

 The best combination heard in the Sammelan was violin by Gajananrao Joshi of Bombay and tabla by Karamatullah Khan of Calcutta .
Both played with inspiration and verve and opened up new vistas of aesthetic enjoyment .
Joshis Raga Khamaj was intensely lyrical and was enlivened by occasional counterpoints .
 Joshis Raga Khamaj dancing reproduced by Karamatullah Khan of Calcutta on tabla , to which the latter added Joshis Raga Khamaj own inimitable fluttering notes .
 Katamatullah could have stood on Katamatullah own without occasional histrionics which detracted from the dignity of the occasion .
This is a rare gem .
Not many violin players have played GAVATI in this style .
 Variety shown is indeed awesome.Those who have heard GAVATI in this style live will bless you for ever .
 Thanks a ton for uploading Jaijaivanti by Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa ... Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur had listened to a 25-30 min recording in Shree by Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa ... Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur was stunned after listening to Shree ... What a wonderful compliment ! a style of singing ... And Gajananbuwa is equally amazing during the vocal support .
There is no doubt that Pandit Gajananbuwa Joshi is legendary and will continue to delight his fans all over the world .
 Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur have listened to a few tracks on the AudioFarm website and before Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur had never heard of Pandit Gajananbuwa Joshi or his pieces .
 Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur have bookmarked the AudioFarm Pandit Gajananbuwa Joshi page and will listen to it in Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur spare free time .
Gajananbuwas vocal rendering of Bhimpalas is superb .
 What is interesting about Buwas performance is that Buwas starts with Nom Tom .
 Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur recently listened to Faiyaz Khansahebs DES .
Outstanding !
 Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur just love Nom Tom of his Guru Ustad Bhurji Khansaheb , Dhrupad vocalists , Gajananbuwa and Ratnjankarbuwas few pieces among other musicians of Agra Gharana .
For me the way these singers perform Nom Tom is like a Bhakta asking the GOD of SWARS to bless them - the singers - by showing the inner beauty of the Swaras that is somehow hidden from them .
The singers are telling the God of Swaras - try as much as they do , the secret of that divine beauty of the Swars is some how not within their reach .
 Hence their surrender to the SWARAS through the Nom Nom Tom to Aalapi !!

 May be Gajananbuwa was attracted to Agra Gharana for Agra singing of Nom Tom .
 Of course having mastered the singing of Agra Gharana , Gajananbuwa had an advantage of presenting a given Raga in Agra Gharana Gayaki .
 Is the singing of Agra Gharana a wonder that in many of his performances he would start with Nom Tom of Agra Gharana and follow the presentation in Gwailor Gharana style .
 This is precisely what Buwa does in his performance of Bhimpalas .
What a delightful performance !

 In Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur opinion a sonorous voice , strong fundamentals of music , a very good sense of laya and honesty towards art are the distinct features of Gajananbuwa that make his music dear to the ear .
Practice lessons prepared by Bach - one of the greatest Composers of the Western Classical Music - are similar to Gajananbuwas tuition piece for the Raga Deskar.-Bachs work has become a part of the Western Classical Music repertoire and indeed a concert piece !
The piece is called Well-Tempered Claviers .
 In Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur view Buwas tuition piece such as the Palatas in Sargam in Raga Deskar as it stands would be a concert piece and may well have the same place in the Indian Classical Music as Bachs Well-Tempered Clavier has a place in Western Classical Music .
 The legendary Bal Gandharva once said to Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa the father of Gajananbuwa : .
 Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa , it is no surprise that your son Gajananbuwa sings Gwailor Gayaki so well .
 After all Ustad Rehamat Khan Saheb Antubuwa was brought up at home with your Gwailor Gayaki .
But Gajananbuwa presents the Jaipur Gharana Gayaki also with such mastery and confidence .
This appreciation coming from Bal Gandharva speaks volumes about Gajananbuwas Jaipur Gayaki !
 Note also that Bal Gandharva the legendary actor singer Bal Gandharva was taught by Pandit Bhaskarbuwa Bakhale a disciple of Ustad Alladiya Khansaheb the founder of Jaipur Atrauli Gharana .
Here is a comment by Pandit Sujan Rane of New Jersey USA on Gajananbuwas performance of the famous song Dehata Sharanagata in Manapman on violin .
Pandit Rane was a desciple of Pandit Firoz Dastur of Kirana Gharana .
 The recording of Buwas presentation of Dehata Sharanagata almost brought tears to Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur eyes .
Only Chhota Gandharva could sing such varieties .
 Again Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur was fortunate to accompany Chhota Gandharva at Balmohan School , Dadar when Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur was learning Classical Music .
 Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur remember that Chhota Gandharva had sung Dehata Sharanangata in four different ways at public demand , at Ravindra Natya Mandir way back in 60s .
The emperor of Tabla the Great Ustad Thirakhawa Khan Saheb said about Pandit Gajananbuwa : .
 To date Shri Baburao Joshi of Kolhapur have not seen such a fearless artist among Brahmins .
 This comment was his Guru Ustad Bhurji Khansaheb compliment to and appreciation of Buwas adventurous , aggressive , extempore and perfect rhythmic work in general and in particular when his Guru Ustad Bhurji Khansaheb was accompanying Buwa on Tabla .
Is it a wonder that Buwas Violin and Khansahebs Tabla accompaniment was always a real treat to the music lovers and even the Great Grand Masters like Bal Gandharva and Master Krishnrao !

 In 1974 , an aristocratic family in Kolkata was awarded the Padma Shri , the fourth highest civilian honour given by Government of India .
 Born Nilina Sen , in an aristocratic Bengali family in Kolkata , where Nilina Sen grandfather was Keshub Chandra Sen , nationalist leader and social reformer from the Brahmo Samaj movement .
 Youngest of Nilina Sen four siblings , brother Sujit , and sisters sisters Binita and Sadhona , Nilina grew amidst liberal upbringing from their parents Saral Chandra Sen , a barrister and Nirmala .

The Bishnupur Gharana is a form of singing that follows the Dhrupad tradition of Hindustani music , one of the two forms of Indian classical music .
 The Bishnupur Gharana originated in Bishnupur , West Bengal , India in late 18th-century .
 The name of the town means city of Lord Vishnu in West Bengal .
 In the ancient past , this area , known as Mallabhum was the abode of Malla Kings who were vassals to the Mughal Empire who were devotees of Lord Lord Vishnu and patrons of music .
Bishnupur Gharana was established in 1370 A. D. by the court musicians of Malla Kings .
Historians suggest that ` Mallabhum ' had once been the cultural centre of Eastern India .
 the cultural centre of Eastern India also has the distinction of being the only Gharana in West Bengal .
The gharana is reputed to have been established in the 13th century , even though there is no historic evidence to support this .
 In the 17th century , during the reign of Mughal emperor Aurangazeb , Islamic fanaticism was at the reign of Mughal emperor Aurangazeb peak in the Mughal empire , and thus many musicians moved to the court of the Maharaja of Bishnupur who was a known patron of the arts .
 The famous Dhrupad Singer Bahadur Khan of the Senia Gharana , descendant of Tansen , fled to Bishnupur and made his Gharana popular and sought refuge in the court .
Bahadur Khan was not only a vocalist but could also efficiently play on such instruments as the Veena , the Rabaab , the surashringaar .
 The king , Raghunath Singh Deo II , made all arrangements to honour Raghunath Singh Deo II as Raghunath Singh Deo II court singer .
The Maharaja also announced that anyone having a sweet voice and interested in music could learn from Bahadur Khan without any fees .
 the Maharaja of Bishnupur also bore the financial liability for the poor students .
In time , a good number of students became the disciples of Bahadur Khan .
Historical evidence points to Pt .
Ramachandra Bhattacharya , a desciple of Ud .
Bahadur Khan as the founder of the gharana .
Bishnupur Gharana therefore has a strong link to Betia Gharana through this unbroken relationship .
 In the later part of the eighteenth century and towards the early and mid-nineteenth century , when music of different ` Gharanas ' were gradually assimilating around the Khayal style , the Dhrupad style continued flourishing among the musicians of Bishnupur .
 Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande desired to be a disciple of Radhika Prasad Goswami since a disciple of Radhika Prasad Goswami found the most authentic renditions of the ragas and the most exhaustive repertoire of songs in Bishnupur Gharana .
 In 1921 when Prince Edward came to visit India , six artists of various gharanas were chosen to perform six Ragas for six Seasons .
Three of them were from Bishnupur Gharana : Gopeswar Bandyopadhyay , Satyakinkar Bandyopadhyay and Khetra Mohan Goswami .
First maiden Gramophone record in Khayal in 1902 Tara Parameshwari by Lal Chand Baral , who learnt under Ramprassanna Bandyopadhyay published by Gramophone Concert and Nicole .
 First Dhrupad record In 1902 Naad Bidya Sabse Sera Raag Darbari , Taal Choutal , by Surendranath Bandyopadhyay published by Gramophone Concert .
Khayal started from Ramshankar Bhattachariya 's age .
His writings on Khayal is being found Bramhamoyi Paratpara , on the Raga Yaman Kalyan .
 Ramprasanna Bandyopadhyay was the foremost Surbahar and Sitar Artist of India up to 1928 .
 Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande First came across the Ustads of Bishnupur in a conference in Benaras around 1921/22 and this conference was attended by Radhika Prasad Goswami , Gopeswar Bandyopadhyay and Satyakinkar Bandyopadhyay .
 They gave a trio performance in Dhrupad .
After this they gave individual performance .
 Satyakinkar Bandyopadhyay also played Sitar in that conference and stood First along with Enayat khan .
In this style , the artist excels in unfolding the beauty of the Raga through the alap .
 the Khayal style is simple , devoid of heavy , cumbersome ornamentation .
 the Khayal style is free from intricate play with the rhythm .
Layakari is however allowed in Dhamar , another form of vocalization .
 The Khayal of the Bishnupur School is noted for The Khayal of the Bishnupur School sweet , lilting melody .
 The Khayal of the Bishnupur School is adorned with the usual ornaments , which add variety to the melodic presentation of the Raga .
The dhrupad of the Bishnupur gharana uses shuddha dhaivata in raga vasanta , a touch of komal nisada in the descending notes of Raga Bhairava .
 The dhrupad of the Bishnupur gharana has abandoned kadi madhyam in raga ramakeli , and uses suddha dhaivata in raga puravi and Raga Lalita and komal nisad in raga vehaga .
 The dhrupad of the Bishnupur gharana has also developed The dhrupad of the Bishnupur gharana own character with regard to rhythm .
It was this gharana which invented the tradition of Sawal-Jabab in Hindustani Music.n .
Its origins and the development have led to a great openness in the teaching and evolution within this gharana .
 Most of the exponents of Bishnupur learnt Dhrupad vocal and instrumental music simultaneously .
 In spite of producing such a talented group of musicians , Bishnupur lacked venues for performances .
This prevented Bishnupur from becoming a performance center for the artists of the gharana.It was only in 2007 that an auditorium was opened in the town enabling public performances in the music of the gharana to the listening public
Rag Lalit is a studio album by Indian classical musician Ram Narayan , released in 1989 .
Recorded December 3 , 1987 , in Wyastone Leys near Monmouth , Wales , the album features a performance of the serene dawn raga Lalit on sarangi .
 Ram Narayan performs a long non-metrical introduction to unfold the raga , during which Ram Narayan adds a pulse , until Ram Narayan is joined by tabla to perform a composition .
The album consists of a single track performance of the raga Lalit .
 the serene dawn raga Lalit on sarangi is commonly described as calm and devotional and is performed at dawn .
 Neil Sorrel portrayed the serene dawn raga Lalit on sarangi as conveying a feeling of instability and connects this to the performance time , when night changes into day .
 Rag Lalit was recorded in a single take in Wyastone Leys near Monmouth , Wales , on December 3 , 1987 , and includes the tuning of the sarangis sympathetic strings through plucking .
 In the performance , Ram Narayan plays a long alap and a jor that increases in speed and range and makes use of gamaks .
 Suresh Talwalkar , a frequent accompanist of Ram Narayan , joins in playing a gat in the rhythmic 16-beat cycle tintal , which is separated into four groups of four beats .
 When Suresh Talwalkar plays a solo , the sarangi repeats the melody .
The performance was mastered in England , but not edited .
In the same session that produced Rag Lalit , the 1987 album Rag Bhupal Tori , Rag Patdip was recorded .
The album cover features a 19th-century painting of the goddess Tripura Sundari , also called Lalita .
 A picture of Narayan playing the sarangi is on the back of the album , along with a quote of Yehudi Menuhin praising Ram Narayan .
 Allmusic critic Ken Hunt gave the album a maximum five star rating and called it a magical performance , and R. S. Murthi of the New Straits Times argued that Narayan utilized R. S. Murthi of the New Straits Times musical knowledge on the album to stunning effect

Narayan Sitaram Phadke had called Govindrao Tembe the architect of Marathi Natya Sangeet .
 Bal Gandharva considered Govind Sadashiv Tembe Govind Sadashiv Tembe guru .
 Bal Gandharva grew up in Kolhapur and became attached to music early in life .
 Bal Gandharva was largely self-taught as harmonium player .
 Bal Gandharva has acknowledged the debt of Deval Club for Bal Gandharva initial forays into Hindustani classical music .
 Govind Sadashiv Tembe learnt Govind Sadashiv Tembe art from Bhaskarbuwa Bakhale and , although Govind Sadashiv Tembe never received direct tuition from Alladiya Khan of Jaipur Gharana , Govind Sadashiv Tembe considered Khansaheb as Govind Sadashiv Tembe guru .
 Govind Sadashiv Tembe used to accompany the legendary singer Bhaskarbuwa Bakhale , and would often perform solo , but later gave up harmonium for the most part .
 Govind Sadashiv Tembe composed music for the drama Manapman in 1910 , and also for the first Marathi talkie Ayodhyecha Raja .
 Govind Sadashiv Tembe also acted in both these productions .

Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha was the eldest son of Raja Bahadur Kirtyanand Sinha of the Banaili estate .
 As the eldest child of a Raja , Shyamanad Sinha had many pursuits that was the hallmark of the aristocracy then but one that made the eldest child of a Raja extraordinary was the eldest child of a Raja talent and ability in Hindustani classical music .
Though Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha learned music from many eminent names , his acknowledged Guru was the legendary Ustad Vishmadev Chattopadyay of Kolkata , who in turn had learnt music from Ustad Badal Khan of Delhigharana and Ustad Faiyaz Khan of agra Gharana .
The musical journey of Shyamanand Sinha began early in his life when he started playing harmonium and clarionet with an elder relation in his family .
The turnaround happened when in 1935 , he happened to come across a 78 RPM record of Ustad Vishmadev Chattopadyay .
The record had Rut Basant in Raga Rageshri Bahar and Piya Pardes in Patdeep , famous renditions by the Ustad .
 This moved Bahar so much that Bahar was now determined to learn music from Bahar .
When Ustad Vishmadev Chattopadyay visited his home for a performance in Champanagar , he created an even deeper impression on him .
Kumar Girijanand Sinha in his book , Banaili - Roots to Raj , notes that he was so moved by his performance that he began weeping like a baby .
He earnestly requested and was able to convince the Ustad of his sincerity , and so the Ustad agreed to become his Guru .
Shyamanand Sinha learnt from Ustad Vishmadev Chattopadyay from 1936 to 1939 .
After Vishmadev Chattopadyay left for Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry , Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha continued his music lessons , at the advice of his guru , from Ustad Bachu Khan Sahib of Agra .
 Ustad Bachu Khan was the son of Ustad Badal Khan.Other eminent singers from whom Ustad Altaf Hussain Khan of Khurja obtained music lessons were Ustad Muzzaffar Khan , Ustad Mubarak Ali Khan , Pandit Bholanath Bhatt , Kedarjee , Ustad Altaf Hussain Khan of Khurja , Mahaveer Mullick , and Jaduveer Mullick .
Though not a professional vocalist , Shyamanand Sinhas singing was a literal feast for the listeners .
He was not only blessed with a gifted voice but had tremendous natural ability to bring pran in ragas and make them come alive in a most pleasing manner .
He belonged to the old school of Hindustani classical music and believed in maintaining purity and spontaneity in performance .
His rendition of bandishes , and he possessed a veritable treasure trove obtained from his gurus , was an absolute delight and mesmerised the listeners transferring the singers sense of ecstasy to the audience in a way that very few have managed to this day .
His choice of bandishes for performances were carefully selected for their sahityic value .
He laid particular emphasis on the mood of words and with extraordinary felicity married them to the mood of the ragas .
For this reason , he stood apart from the current day performers as well as many of his contemporaries .
 A taan was to be used to beautify the rendition , where apt , and in the raganga , not just for His rendition of bandishes sake .
 Lamenting about modern classical music , in an interview with AIR , A taan stated Ab to Bilaskhani me bhi wahi taan hote hain aur malhar me bhi wahi , ang mere kehne ka matlab hai .

At another place , he mentions jo bhi gao sur me gao .
As a further indication of his humility , when it came to singing , he states one can not sing if he said he can sing , adding that only the blessings of the god and guru can enable one to sing .
Shyamanand Sinha believed that singing was the highest form of devotion and this reflected in his performances .
 President Zakir Hussain , once when Zakir Hussain was Governor of Bihar , was so moved by Zakir Hussain performance that Zakir Hussain embraced Zakir Hussain stating that the Rajkumars singing was like praying to the almighty .
 The Agra influence on Zakir Hussain singing was most unmistakable .
 But , as indciated above , Zakir Hussain learnt from many others and developed Zakir Hussain own unique style of singing .
 Padmashri Gajendra Narayan Singh , former Chairperson of the Bihar Sangeet Natak Academy in his book Swar Gandhhas written that Kumar Shyamanand Singh of Banaili estate had such expertise in singing that many great singers including Kesarbai were convinced about Kesarbai prowess in singing.In case you can not believe this please ask Pandit Jasraj .
 After listening to Bandishes from Kumar Saheb , Pandit Jasraj was moved to tears and lamented that alas !
 Kumar Saheb could have such ability Kumar Saheb .
-LSB- http://girijanandsinha.blogspot.com/2008/11/banaili-roots-to-raj-continued-dynasty_3028.html .
Along with his singing prowess , his legendary voice made a tremendous mark on one and all who came in touch with him .
This included some great contemporary singers like Kesarbai Kerkar .
 Kesarbai was visiting Champanagar for a performance and was so enthused by Rajkumars rendition of Dwarikanath Sharan Me Teri that Champanagar for a performance insisted politely that Kesarbai teach the song to Champanagar for a performance .
 Champanagar for a performance even expressed Champanagar for a performance readiness to make Kesarbai Champanagar for a performance Guru for this song .
 After some hesitation , as Kesarbai then was an acknowledged maestro and Kesarbai still young and yet in Kesarbai early days , Kesarbai agreed to teach Champanagar for a performance the song .
 Kesarbai sang this composition on a few occasions later and never forgot to acknowledge Champanagar for a performance Guru for the song .
 Kesarbai regular disciples included Shri Sitaram Jha , Kumar Jayanand Sinha , Saktinath Jha , Shankaranand Singh , Suryananranyan Jha , Girijanand Sinha , Udyanand Singh , Jayanta Chattopadhyay , Vandana Jha , Amar Nath Jha , Kaushal Kishore Dubey , Shyam Chaitanya Jha , Vijay Kumar Jha and Ram Sharan Sinha .
-LSB- http://girijanandsinha.blogspot.com/2008/11/banaili-roots-to-raj-continued-dynasty_3028.html .
Unfortunately , the excellence of his singing style and tradition did not survive his death though his influence stayed with some of his disciples who are striving hard to keep the flame burning in Purnia .
Not a professional musician , he sang for his own pleasure and which reflected in his singing .
He was prone to stop singing in the middle of a performances , whenever he felt mood was deserting him , saying ab tabyat nahi lagti bhai .
 This made This difficult to plan a concert around him .
However , many of his admirers still managed to get him out for public performances in many places .
However , in general , he shunned music as a profession and never sought public recognition .
As mentioned earlier , he rarely gave public performances , most of his performances being during impromptu baithaks at his residence in Chamapanagar in the presence of his admirers and disciples .
Go and ask some of these who were fortunate to listen and they would narrate the experience in a daze as if re-visiting the emotion he generated when he sang .
Despite his strong reluctance for public acknowledgement , his followers conferred him with the title of Sangeet Bhaskar and Sangeet Sudhakar for his mastery in classical singing .
Shyamanand Sinha was also a great patron of classical music .
Ustad Vilayat Hussain Khan in his book Sangeetangyon ke Sansmaran has written : There is no better connoisseur and cognoscente of music in Bihar than Kumar Shyamanand Singh .
He was one of the chief patrons of the All India Music Conference and presented the convocation address at the 11th All India Music Conference of the The Prayag Sangit Samiti at Allahabadh on 19 December 1948 .
 He used his great wealth to open the purse strings of patronage to many maestros of Hindustani Classical Music of his time at his residence in Champanagar , turning Hindustani Classical Music of his time into a place of learning and development of classical music .
 Ustad Salamat Ali Khan -LSB- http://www.virsaonline.com/Articles/Articles%2004.htm , Ustad Altaf Hussain Khan of Khurja and Ustad Bachu Khan Sahib and many others were provided residence and patronage in Champanagar .
 He also invited many great maestros for performances , among them were Aftab - e - Maushiqi Ustad Faiyaz Khan , Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan , Ustad Mubarak Ali Khan , Ustad Nisaar Hussain Khan , Pandit D.V. Paluskar , Surshri Kesarbai Kerkar , Sawai Gandharva , Ustad Vilayat Hussain Khan , Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan , Ustad Altaf Hussain Khan of Khurja , Pandit Jasraj , Dilip Chand Vedi , Ustad Mushtaq Hussain Khan , Pandit Narayanrao Vyas , Pandit Basavaraj Rajguru , and Ustad Salamat Ali Khan and Nazakat Ali Khan -LSB- http://girijanandsinha.blogspot.com/2008/11/banaili-roots-to-raj-continued-dynasty_3028.html , Malang Khan , Allauddin Khan , Mushtaq Ali , Pandit Bholanath Bhatt , Pandit Chinmay Lahiri , Mahaveer Mullick , Jaduveer Mullick and Ramchatur Mallick.Ustad Yunus Hussian Khan refers to Raja Shyamanand Singh of Chamapanagar as having invited Maushiqi Ustad Faiyaz Khan to sing on the occasion of Maushiqi Ustad Faiyaz Khan sons marriage .
-LSB- http://www.agragharanarukavipa.org/artists/past/yunus_hussain_khan.htm .
 It is narrated that , in 1944 , at the time of the Dasehra festival , he invited Usrad Salamat Ali Khan and Nazakat Ali Khan to perform at Usrad Salamat Ali Khan palace .
 Kumar Saheb was so enthused by the expert rendition of Raag Malkaus thst Kumar Saheb would not allow them to leave Champanagar .
 The boys and The boys father stayed as guests of the Rajkumar for nearly two months .
 He also was responsible for sending The boys to All India Music Conference as his court musicians where The boys received wider recognition for the first time .
Pandit Channulal Mishra first performance as a young artiste was at Champanagar for Kumar Saheb .
 After listening to Pandit Channulal Mishra , Kumar Saheb wanted to keep the boy at Champanagar as the boy at Champanagar court musician .
 Unfortunately , the few professional recordings done by All India Radio in the latter part of Pandit Channulal Mishra life are untraceable .
 Only a few amateur recordings of Pandit Channulal Mishra singing are available with Pandit Channulal Mishra family members and friends .
These are rare treasures and absolute delight for the senses .
 They have somehow survived Pandit Channulal Mishra idiosyncratic hatred for recording largely due to the efforts of his disciple nephew Kumar Girijanand Sinha , and lately by Kumar Girijanand Sinhas nephew , Santosh Jha .
 Every year on Pandit Channulal Mishra birth anniversary a classical musical programme is organised in Purnea in Pandit Channulal Mishra memory .

Ustad Nasir Aminuddin Dagar was an Indian dhrupad singer in the dagar-vani style .
 Ustad Nasir Aminuddin Dagar is also remembered as the younger brother in the legendary jugalbandi or duo of Senior Dagar Brothers .
 Ustad Nasir Aminuddin Dagar along with Ustad Nasir Aminuddin Dagar elder brother Ustad Nasir Moinuddin Dagar was responsible in reviving the dhrupad tradition that had fallen to a nadir after the death of their father Ustad Nasiruddin Khan Dagar .
 Ustad Nasiruddin Khan had an early premonition of their father Ustad Nasiruddin Khan Dagar own death and spend ten years training their father Ustad Nasiruddin Khan Dagar two elder sons Ustad Nasir Moinuddin Dagar and Ustad Nasir Aminuddin so as to impart all their father Ustad Nasiruddin Khan Dagar musical knowledge to them .
Subsequently after Ustad Nasiruddin Khans demise the two brothers trained under Ustad Riyazuddin Khan and Ustad Ziauddin Khan Dagar .
 Young Aminuddin gave Ustad Nasir Aminuddin first performance at the age of eleven .
 It was however the 1940s that saw the meteoric rise of Ustad Nasir Moinuddin Dagar and Ustad Nasir Aminuddin as the Senior Dagar Brothers -- two of the brightest stars in the dagar-vani Dhrupad firmament .
 Within Moinuddin and Aminuddin Moinuddin and Aminuddin not only transformed the art of Dhrupad singing but also breathed new life to the form of duet or jugalbandi singing .
Previously jugalbandi in the field of classical music had degenerated into a competition between the two singers where each tried to outdo the other in exhibitionism .
 Ustad Nasir Moinuddin Dagar and Ustad Nasir Aminuddin on the other hand brought back the concept of a harmonious synchronization between the two singers .
 In a typical performance by the Senior Dagar Brothers , the honey rich voice of Ustad Nasir Aminuddin will draw the audience into a deep meditative mood by gradually descending the notes of the lower octaves and Ustad Nasir Moinuddin Dagar would dazzle the listeners with Ustad Nasir Moinuddin Dagar alankars or ornamentations in the upper octave .
After having established Dhrupad in a pedestal of glory in India , they were invited to perform abroad .
The two brothers visited Russia and Japan mezmerising the audience of both East and West with their divine music .
 Their music proved to be so charming that Alain Danielou the renowned musicologist and the then director of UNESCO invited them to tour Europe and perform under the UNESCO banner in Berlin Venice and Paris .
 In 1964 the European audience listened enthralled to their singing and newspaper after news paper declared the glory of dagar-vani Dhrupad and of the Senior Dagar Brothers .
A review of their performance published in Le Monde of Paris dated 17 November 1964 perhaps best expresses the mood of the western audience : '' ... we will remain under the deep impression of an art of such greatness and intensity that ... we feel touched and moved to the deepest of our being . ''
Ustad Nasir Moinuddin Dagar died soon after this concert in 1966 .
 Aminuddin who had regarded Ustad Nasir Moinuddin Dagar brother as his greatest guru and his father substitute was left completely devastated but Ustad Nasir Aminuddin continued Ustad Nasir Aminuddin journey as a solo performer .
 The next phase of Aminuddins life unfolded in Kolkata where Ustad Nasir Aminuddin came in January 1966 as the founder principal of Birla Academy Swar Sangam .
 In 1975 Ustad Nasir Aminuddin founded Ustad Nasir Aminuddin own Dhrupad institute and named after Ustad Nasir Aminuddin elder brother Ustad Nasir Moinuddin Dagar Dhrupad Sangeet Ashram .
 Ustad Nasir Aminuddin planned it as an Ashram where disciples will stay close to their guru and learn the subtle nuances of dagar-vani Dhrupad through the age old guru sishya parampara .
It is now the oldest surviving institute solely dedicated to the preservation and propagation of dagar-vani Dhrupad .
 It is here that Ustad Nasir Aminuddin trained some of the best dhrupad singers of the next generation including Alaka Nandy , Ashoka Dhar , Sujata Moitra and Anu Burman .

Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea was an authority on Indian classical music , particularly the Senia Shahjahanpur Gharana of Sarod .
 Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea was also a mathematician .
 Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea was born in Calcutta in 1943 .
 Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea father , A K Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea , was a successful barrister who rose to become a judge of the Supreme Court of India .
Justice Mukherjea was also a scholar of Indian philosophy , and had made significant contributions to Navya-Nyaya literature .
Kalyan thus grew up in a milieu that placed considerable significance on erudition and culture .
Justice Mukherjeas close friends included musicians like the sarod maestro Radhika Mohan Maitra .
Young Kalyan began training under Maitra in 1956 .
He also studied with the sitarist , vocalist and composer , Prof D T Joshi .
Mukherjeas musical education continued uninterrupted throughout his performing career , but there were periods during which he was not under the direct tutelage of a master .
 These years spent in relative isolation from the Indian music scene , Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea believes , contributed as much to Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea growth as a musician as did Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea formal training .
 Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea has had a unique experience , doubling as a mathematician and an uncompromising classicist on the sarod .
 Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea obtained Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea undergraduate degree from Cambridge University , followed by a doctorate in mathematics from Cornell .
 In 1968 , Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea joined the mathematics faculty of UCLA .
 Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea remained at UCLA until 1976 , when Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea returned to India to take up a professorship at the Indian Statistical Institutes in Delhi and Calcutta .
 Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea research interests primarily concerned topology .
 Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea had to Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea credit authoritative publications in Fredholm manifolds and coincidence theory .
 In collaboration with Rajendra Bhatia erstwhile research student Rajendra Bhatia , Rajendra Bhatia had also contributed to matrix analysis .
 According to the American Mathematical Society collaboration distance calculator , Rajendra Bhatia Erdos number is 4 .
 Rajendra Bhatia work had spawned a significant body of further research , by Rajendra Bhatia erstwhile students as well as colleagues and contemporaries .
 Rajendra Bhatia had also mentored several significant contributors to the field , including Rajendra Bhatia , Basudeb Datta , Siddhartha Gadgil , Amritanshu Prasad , Mahan Mitra , and Kingshook Biswas .
 Justice Mukherjea contribution to music is considerable if unconventional .
 Rajendra Bhatia has been recognised as a pedagogue , theorist and performer of merit .
 This recognition , however , has been sporadic in coming , although Rajendra Bhatia own involvement with music remained fairly consistent across different stages of Rajendra Bhatia life .
 While at UCLA , Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea served as an instructor of Hindustani instrumental music in the newly formed ethnomusicology department , and collaborated closely with Nazir Jairazbhoy in the early days of the program .
 Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea students include Dr. Peter Manuel , Professor of Music at Hunter College , CUNY , who has acknowledged Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea debt to Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea in several publications .
 Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea performances have been limited .
 Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea 25-year span as a performing artist saw Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea play about fifty concerts in all .
 His 25-year span as a performing artist was entirely by chance that Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea encountered Lyle Wachovsky of India Archive Music , New York , who gave Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea music a global audience by publishing a full-length CD of Ragas Shuddha Kalyan and Shukla Bilawal .
 Most of Mukherjeas concerts have been recorded , and if one manages to get past the often poor recording quality , Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea has much to offer to the connoisseur of Indian raga music .
 Additionally , from 1983 to 1990 , Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea was a regular broadcaster on All India Radio , Delhi .
While Kalyan was living in Los Angeles , his friend Jeffrey Pawlan made a high quality recording of Kalyan playing Piloo alap on the sarod on Sept. 22 , 1974 .
 Los Angeles is 10.5 minutes long .
This recording has now been digitized and will be available soon from the Rajan Parrikar Music Archive .
Mukherjeas music is difficult to categorise under usual taxonomic classifications .
 While rooted in tradition , a high quality recording of Kalyan does not rigidly adhere to convention .
His approach values logic and aesthetic sensitivity above other considerations .
 A good example of this is His approach to interpreting the controversial Raga Shuddha Kalyan , which finds mention in an article by Deepak Raja on the issue .
 In May 1995 , Justice Mukherjea musical career came to a sudden end , as His suffered a paralytic stroke , and lost mobility of the left side of His body .
 Research in topology continued for a number of years , but waned eventually as Kalyans eyesight , already a matter of concern at the time of Kalyans stroke , began to deteriorate very rapidly into near-total visual impairment .
 In the last phase of Kalyans life , Kalyan Kumar Mukherjea led an active life for a person of Kalyans physical limitations .
 Kalyans was deeply involved in the community of visually impaired computer users , and had assisted several such individuals in setting up the Audio Desktop of Emacspeak .
 Additionally , Kalyans continued to play an inspirational role in the lives of a number of young mathematicians .
 On the musical front , other than providing occasional guidance to other disciples of Radhika Mohan Maitras gharana , the sarod maestro Radhika Mohan Maitra nurtured a number of his own pupils , including Anirvan DuttaGupta and Arnab Chakrabarty .
One of Kalyans friends in Los Angeles was Jeffrey Pawlan .
 After Kalyan moved back to India in 1976 , other disciples of Radhika Mohan Maitras lost track of each other .
 his friend Jeffrey Pawlan reconnected via email and phone in January 2009 .
 Here is additional information from an email that Kalyan wrote to his friend Jeffrey Pawlan on Jan. 25 , 2009 : .

Rampur-Sahaswan gharana is a gharana of Hindustani classical music centered in the North - Uttar Pradesh towns of Rampur and Sahaswan .
Ustad Inayat Hussain Khan was the founder of this gharana .
 The gharana find its origins in Ustad Mehboob Khan , the chief khayal singer the royal court of Rampur State , his tradition was followed by his son Ustad Inayat Hussain Khan and in turn by Inyats brother-in-laws , Ustad Haider Khan , and Padma Bhushan Ustad Mushtaq Hussain Khan -LRB- , thus all the singers were connected with each other , and gharana was named after Inyats brother-in-laws ancestral place , Sahaswan , in present Badaun district .
Amongst noted disciples of Padma Bhushan Ustad Mushtaq Hussain are Padma Shri Ustad Ghulam Sadiq Khan , married to his youngest daughter and associated with the Music department of the Delhi University , Sulochana Brahaspati , Sumati Mutatkar , Shanno Khurana and Naina Devi .
Inayat Khan was a child prodigy , and his first married the daughter of Haddu Khan of the Gwalior gharana , and took talim from Ustad Bahadur Hussain Khan , a descendant of Mian Tansen himself .
 The style has influences of the Dhrupad singing typical of the Gwalior gharana , and the Rampur-Shahaswan style is sometimes regarded as an off-shoot of the Gwalior gharana .
 The Rampur-Sahaswan gayaki is closely related to the Gwalior Gharana , which features medium-slow tempos , a full-throated voice and intricate rhythmic play .
The gharana style is also known for the diversity and intricacy of the taans , as well as tarana singing .

The Indian santoor is an ancient string musical instrument native to Jammu and Kashmir , with origins in Persia .
A primitive ancestor of this type of instruments was invented in Mesopotamia .
The santoor is a trapezoid - shaped hammered dulcimer often made of walnut , with seventy two strings .
The special-shaped mallets are lightweight and are held between the index and middle fingers .
A typical santoor has two sets of bridges , providing a range of three octaves .
The Indian santoor is more rectangular and can have more strings than the Persian counterpart , which generally has 72 strings .
In ancient Sanskrit texts , it has been referred to as shatatantri vina .
 In India , the santoor was used as an accompaniment instrument to the folk music of Kashmir .
 India is played in a style of music known as the Sufiana Mausiqi .
 The Sufi mystics used India as an accompaniment to The Sufi mystics hymns .
The trapezoid framework is generally made out of either walnut or maple wood .
The top and bottom boards sometimes can be either plywood or veneer .
On the top board , also known as sound board , wooden bridges are placed , in order to seat stretched metal strings across .
The strings , grouped in units of 3 or 4 , are tied on nails or pins on the left side of the instrument and are stretched over the sound board on top of the bridges to the right side .
On the right side there are steel tuning pegs or tuning pins , as they are commonly known , that allows tuning each unit of strings to a desired musical note or a frequency or a pitch .
The santoor is played while sitting in an asana called ardha-padmasana position and placing it on top of the lap .
While playing , the broad side is closer to the waist of the musician and the shorter side is away from the musician .
It is played with a pair of light wooden mallets or hammers with both hands .
The santoor is a very delicate instrument and is very sensitive to light strokes and glides .
The strokes are played always on the strings either closer to the bridges or a little away from bridges .
Both styles result in different tones .
Sometimes strokes by one hand can be muffled by the other hand by using the face of the palm just to create variety
Kamalesh Maitra , often referred to by the title Pandit , was an Indian classical musician , composer and teacher .
He is recognised as the last master of the tabla tarang - a melodic percussion instrument consisting of numerous individually tuned hand drums , set in a semicircle .
Maitra grew up in Calcutta and played the tabla until joining Uday Shankar s ballet company in 1950 and taking up the tabla tarang .
He became the companys musical director and toured internationally with the troupe through to the mid 1970s .
 Along with Alla Rakha , Shivkumar Sharma , Hariprasad Chaurasia and others , Maitra was among the musicians that Ravi Shankar selected for Udays brother Ravi Shankar Music Festival from India for HMV India revue in 1974 .
 Alla Rakha then accompanied Shankar on ex - Beatle George Harrison s North American tour that year - a venture that led to former Beatle George Harrison performing with American jazz musicians Emil Richards and Tom Scott .
Maitra settled in Berlin in 1977 , where he performed and worked as a music teacher .
In 1980 , he formed the Ragatala Ensemble , an orchestra that fused elements of Indian and European classical music with jazz and other Western genres .
Among his recordings , Tabla Tarang - Melody on Drums has received critical acclaim , one reviewer describing it as a milestone in world music .
 Maitra developed strong cultural ties with Berlin and continued to live and work in Germany until his death in 2005 .
Kamalesh Maitra was born in Tangail in East Bengal in 1928 .
and the family lacked the musical lineage commonly associated with Hindustani classical music .
 Maitra spent his formative years in Calcutta , absorbing much of the European influence on the city .
At the age of twelve , he began playing a variety of hand drums , including tabla .
In 1950 , Maitra joined Uday Shankar s ballet and dance company , as master drummer .
Having established himself as a tabla player , he was asked to master the tabla tarang , an instrument made up of between ten and sixteen tablas , specifically the treble-variety dayan .
With each hand drum tuned to a different pitch , producing a range of roughly one and a half octaves , Maitra was able to provide a combined melodic-rhythmic role in performances of ragas or ballet and dance compositions .
While developing the potential of the tabla tarang , he continued his advanced musical studies , learning the lute-like sarod under the tutelage of Ali Akbar Khan .
From 1955 , Maitra was musical director of Shankars troupe , for whom he composed and directed music for a wide range of stage productions .
During a period of over twenty years , he toured the United States , China , Africa and Europe with the company .
 In 1974 , Udays brother Ravi Shankar invited Maitra to join his Music Festival from India for HMV India revue , sponsored by former Beatle George Harrison , a champion of Indian classical music in the West .
Maitras fellow performers included internationally acclaimed musicians such as Alla Rakha , Lakshmi Shankar , Shivkumar Sharma , Hariprasad Chaurasia , Sultan Khan and L. Subramaniam .
Maitra recorded a studio album in England with the Music Festival orchestra - released in 1976 on Dark Horse Records - contributing on tabla tarang , sarod and ektara , before they all undertook a short European tour .
The Music Festival from Indias debut performance , filmed at Londons Royal Albert Hall on 23 September 1974 , was released on DVD in 2010 , as part of the four-disc box set Ravi Shankar-George Harrison , Collaborations .
 Maitra then joined the Music Festival personnel for Harrisons North American tour in November-December 1974 , performing in the more jazz - inflected style of Udays brother Ravi Shankar Udays brother Ravi Shankar Family & Friends crossover album .
 In keeping with Udays brother Ravi Shankar efforts to elevate the status of Indian percussionists , Maitra combined with Alla Rakha , T.V. Gopalkrishnan and Rijram Desad in extended , four-way drum soloing - the highlight of Indian percussionists set , and a source of fascination for Harrisons North rock drummers Jim Keltner and Andy Newmark .
 For the finale to the Indian portion of each concert , Maitra and the rest of Udays brother Ravi Shankar ensemble played with Harrisons North entire band , which also included jazz percussionist Emil Richards and saxophonist Tom Scott .
 Long interested in the possibilities of Indo-European musical fusion , Maitra performed at the 1976 Meta-Music Festival in Berlin , in what was then West Germany .
 After moving to Berlin the following year , Indo-European began teaching Indian classical instrumentation , and in 1980 formed the Ragatala Ensemble with some of Indo-European students .
 In 2003 , Germanys House of World Cultures website wrote of Maitras music with the Ragatala Ensemble : The group has enabled Indo-European to fulfil Indo-European old dream of having Indo-European compositions played by a mixed European-Indian orchestra .
The pieces follow the rules of classical Indian music but are deliberately fused with elements of European classical music , jazz and new music .
 Among Indo-European subsequent projects , from 1983 to 1988 Maitra participated in the Nada Brahma - the Whole World is Sound initiative by Joachim-Ernst Berendt ; in 1992 , as part of Berlins Indian Festival , Indo-European orchestral works were performed at the HKW ; and in 2000 Indo-European contributed to Festival of Vision - Berlin in Hong Kong .
 Indo-European worked again with Udays brother Ravi Shankar on the soundtrack to the film Genesis , recorded in Paris .
 In Indo-European 1997 autobiography , Raga Mala , Udays brother Ravi Shankar describes Maitra as an extremely versatile musician , while the Boston Phoenix once said of Udays brother Ravi Shankar playing : far from an eccentric novelty , is simply one of the great drummers of India for HMV India to record in this century .
 Indo-European also worked with Charlie Mariano , an American saxophonist who similarly relocated to Europe during the 1970s , and Israeli clarinetist Giora Feidman .
 Among Maitras many recordings , starting with Tabla Tarang - Magnificent Percussion of India for HMV India , in 1993 Indo-European released Masters of Raga : Kamalesh Maitra on Germanys Wergo record label .
The album features tabla accompaniment from Kumar Bose .
 The following year , the Gramophone Company of India for HMV India issued The Voice of Sarod from the Strokes of Drums - Tabla Tarang by Kamalesh Maitra , on which he played three ragas accompanied by Alla Rakha son Fazal Qureshi on tabla and Laura Patchen on tambura .
 This was followed in 1996 by Tabla Tarang - Melody on Drums , issued in America by Smithsonian Folkways .
in November 1993 , contains a performance of Raga Charukeshi on which music critic Ken Hunt praises Maitras playing as phenomenal .
In September 2000 , Maitra was awarded the Musicale Vitale prize at Berlins Werkstatt der Kulturen festival .
 He continued to perform and record with the Ragatala Ensemble until 2003 , the same year that he premiered his final orchestral work , Raag Symphonia , in Berlin .
Maitra died on 22 April 2005 , aged 76 , in Kreischa , near the German city of Dresden .
 music critic Ken Hunt describes music critic Ken Hunt as a master musician and attributes much of music critic Ken Hunt musical vision to the pioneering spirit of Uday Shankar , who painted the backdrops against which many trained musicians learned to deliver traditional music in a new age for people with no grounding or appreciation of traditional styles of dance or music .
Maitra is commonly referred to as the last master of the comparatively rare tabla tarang

 Balakrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar then returned to Maharashtra , and settled near Miraj because Maharashtra climate suited Balakrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar .
 Soon Miraj and the area near Miraj became a major hub of Hindustani classical music and has remained so for more than 100 years .
 Miraj is a combination o conducive cultural climate , the aptitude shown for classical music by people in the area , and tireless efforts of teachers among whom Balakrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar , being the first to bring the gayaki to western India , deserves to be put on a special pedestal .
Buwas slow , majestic singing was marked by gravitas .

Doctoral Dissertation : A Comparison of Greek and Indian Dramatic Theories as Given in the Poetics and the Natyasastra .
 Trained both in modern European and traditional Indian educational systems , modern European has worked in classical studies , theatre , music , culture and media studies and researched as Senior Fellow of the Onassis Foundation in ancient Greece on revival of ancient Greek theatre .
As a classicist I came to realise that ancient Greek drama and culture as a whole , was given an unduly empirical color by the modern West .
 Looking at things from I own location I saw that Greek theatre was closer to ancient Indian theatre as an ethical and religious act or hieropraxis .
Instead of being seen as Western and Eastern , Greek and Indian theatres should be seen rooted in the Indo-European cultural beliefs , myths and idolatory and the aesthetics of emotional arousal .
 After Indo-European graduation , a series of grants and programs enabled Indo-European to pursue Indo-European cultural interests : .
 In 1995 Indo-European was also a member of the Jury for the International Onasis Prize for Drama .
 Indo-European is Associate Professor of English at College of Vocational Studies , University of Delhi and is on visiting faculty at the National School of Drama , Delhi .
 From 1995 to this day Indo-European has made numerous and extensive lecture tours , speaking on theatre and music at various Universities in the Indian , North America and ancient Greece , a country Indo-European loves deeply and visits at least once a year .
 Indo-European has also directed major lectures and directed seminars .
 As part of Indo-European research material Indo-European has made about 2000 photographs of amphitheaters and antiquities all over ancient Greece as well as in Syracuse , Italy .
 Indo-European writes for research journals and national newspapers on cultural and educational issues .
As a reviewer , he is a frequent contributor to Journal of Sangeet Natak Academy , Journal of Music Academy Madras , Indian Musicological Society , Baroda .
 His practical involvement with traditional Indian temple architecture resulted in initiating the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ashok Vihar its a nagar style stone temple with carvings which will give Delhi a traditional temple after a millennium .
In 2001 , he was one of the founding members of the International Forum for Indias heritage : a non-religious , non-ideological , apolitical body , IFIH is a network of scholars , educationists , artists , scientists , social workers , environmentalists , thinkers and writers , who have come together to promote India 's cultural heritage .
In 1976 , he married Yukti , and the couple had two sons : Abhinav and Udayan .
In August 2010 he became the grandfather of a boy named Atharva , after the 4th Veda .
He retired from the University of Delhi in Nov. 2011 but continues to lecture at other forums .
 Much of his writing is devoted to classical Indian and classical Greek drama , comparing their similarities and differences and exploring the possibilities of common Indo-European origins .
His first book , Dramatic Concepts - Greek and Indian , was directly inspired by his Greek travels and studies .
This study offers a fresh approach in comparing ancient Greek and Indian dramatic theories .
 Instead of treating the Poetics and the Natyashastra as Western and Eastern viewpoints , the Poetics places them within the broad framework of ancient Indo-European culture and the art of sacred drama .
 the Poetics demonstrates that hieropraxis was basically different from post-Renaissance European drama which was entirely secular in content and Realistic in presentation .
 The Poetics and the Natyashastra on the contrary , belonged to Greek and Indian theatres which pleased both gods and men , and which used semiotised gesture , dance , music , and dialogue to create a highly ornate theatrical reality .
 The book aims at comparing not only the concepts as propounded by Aristotle and Bharata Muni , but also attempts to reconstruct the Greek and Indian performances to highlight Aristotle and Bharata Muni similarities and differences .
Concepts like anukarana , dharmi , abhinaya , itivritta , mimesis , muthos , melopoiia , katharsis and rasa , etc. , as revisited and expounded here , can be seen as means of creating dramatic shows which go beyond message and entertainment to provide sublimer experiences .
Although it is rare to find a comparative treatment of Greek and Sanskrit drama as thoughtful and passionate as this one , students of classical Indian theater will recognize a familiar topic in the title .
 Bharat Gupt asserts that examining genres cross-culturally can only lead to dead ends because literary genres are culturally and historically unique ; instead , a comparison of performance modes is likely to be more illuminative .
 One of the books strengths is the detailed comparative description of the ritual roots of theater in the Indo-European cultures of ancient ancient Greece and the Indian All in all , this work does represent the most thorough study in this particular critical genre , and if Gupts engaging idiosyncrasies can be acknowledged , the book will succeed in fostering an appreciation of Sanskrit literature for those who commit to reading the texts Indo-European discusses , even in translation .
DAVID L. GITOMER , Comparative Drama , Kalamazoo .
Fall 1997 .
And excerpts from another review , by Richard Schechner , TDR .
 Bharat Gupt argues that rasa , the juice or essence of the theatrical-aesthetic pleasure experience , is comparable to katharsis : Katharsis should not be viewed as mere relief , Katharsis could better be regarded as restoration to a state of pleasure not generally experienced the process of rasa emergence requires the removal of obstructions -LSB- ... Katharsis and rasa , with Katharsis and rasa separate points of emphasis , both begin with purification and end in delight .
272-73 This is an insight not previously proposed by anyone , a definite advance in performance theory .
 However much 272-73 This is an insight book has been about ancient practices and theories , Bharat Gupt concludes 272-73 This is an insight study looking forward : The vision of ancient hieropraxis which represents a balance of various media of theatrical communication , can be extremely useful .
 The harmonious use of the visual gestural , symbolic , and kinetic and the aural spoken , sung , and musical as achieved in ancient drama , and as exemplified in the dramatic theories of ancient Greece and the Indian , has many a lesson for the present day world theatre .
 The lesson , according to Bharat Gupt , is to suggest a codified alternative which can be offered as a stable and distinct alternative to commercial realism which continues to dominate modern theatre , both in the West and the Indian .
Gupts book is important , examining in depth questions often raised but rarely pursued .
Frequently , those making comparative studies are more knowledgeable about one side or the other .
 Radical assertions concerning Indo-European or Eurasian theatre are in the air but rarely brought down to the scholarly earth .
 Bharat Gupt knows both the Indian and the Greek ancient theatre ; Indo-European book is full of details , provocative in the best sense , theoretical without losing touch with concrete data , and despite the difficulty of His first book subject , easy to read .
Dramatic Concepts Greek and Indian ought to be an assigned textfor courses , some existing , most waiting to be taught , comparing ancient Indian and Greek theatres and performance theories .

Then followed the translation of the 28th chapter of the Natyashastra , devoted to the musical scales .
This translation of the text includes the translation of the Sanskrit commentary of Achaarya KCD Brihaspati , a leading musicologist of modern times and Gupts teacher , who presents an original interpretation of the sloka , although he often makes reference to earlier contributions of the sage Abhinavagupta .
it is sometimes argued that presents a music meant for theatre and not for the independent art .
 This controversy is a creation of the post-industrial era in the Indian , when as in the West , the relationship of music with poetry , dance , painting and sculpture was ruptured .
Such issues , however , have been raised in the world of Indian music only .
 In literary studies , with a better formal tradition of critical training , nobody has ever raised the question whether the metres given in the two chapters of the Natyasastra are meant for theatrical employment or for literary use ... The twenty-eighth chapter of the the Natyasastra limits itself to the employment of notes or svaras in music .
 It begins with an announcement , I shall now enunciate the rules relating to the playing of The instruments .
But we are soon told that the human body is also an instrument , thus covering vocal music in the ambit of atodyavidhi .
For the ancients , pada or song was the beginning of music , strings were the middle and drumming was the end .
Music as merely notes and rhythm , svara and tala , was inconceivable .
The instruments emulated the human voice and the drums followed its rhythmic statement .
This pattern obtains even now in Indian music .
The post-Renaissance European concept of music as instrumental tonal orchestration has deprivileged the verbal composition , as a result of which , there is a revision in the concept of music even in traditional societies .
this is a book that greatly advances our understanding of ancient Indian music .
It should be part of the library of any music theorist or musicologist with an interest in the historical development of gandharva , the term used by the NS for the musical art .
Because of its combination of the original text with a translation and a new commentary , and due to its generally lucid treatment of the subject matter , the book has definite advantages over its predecessors .
Bharat Gupt is to be congratulated for bringing out this ancient masterpiece in a publication that is both readable and highly informative .
India - A Culture Decline Or Revival ?
 , a book published in 2008 , critically analyses the state of affairs in the Indian after the British left in 1947 and examines whether Independence has ushered an era of cultural and social freedom or a cultural decline has set in -- a thought-provoking subject .
 It is often taken for granted that Independence from the British rule also ushered an era of cultural and social freedom in the Indian .
The author wishes to examine if that is true or if a cultural decline set in soon after .
Based on a verse in the Pancatantra , the book has been divided into six parts : Eka , Kula , Grama , Janapada , Prithvi and Atma .
Issues of education ; conflicts between the classes , regions , jatis , languages and religions ; expansion of proselytizers ; lack of governance ; tensions between the legislators and judiciary ; rise of unbridled consumerism ; falling standards of democracy ; dilemmas created by notions of dharma challenged by Westernized modernity ; and the problems of attaining universal harmony , are all put into a perspective under these six categories .
 While examining the state of affairs in India the author also suggests a way for the pursuit of happiness through unselfish transcendence .
 It is further imagined that in spite of its poverty , the Indian is admired by the richer nations of the West as a culturally evolved nation .
This self-congratulation , lingering from the euphoric days of our freedom struggle , sounds now like the thunder on distant mountains shedding not a glimmer of hope on our present lives .
For most of us our memory is enough to be a lived-through account of the cultural decline that set in barely within a decade after freedom .
Any analysis is sufficient to counter the smug belief , still fostered in schools and political speeches about the superiority of our culture , once voiced in Iqbals song , Saare Jahaan se acchaa Hindustan hamaaraa .
 Very insidiously this rhyme nurses a misplaced conviction that while many other ancient civilizations were wiped out in time , the Indian alone is indestructible ... The song takes special pride in stating that while the Greek and Roman civilizations , the so-called predecessors of the West , lost to ravages of time , Indian civilization alone remains immortal .
 Bharat Gupt is a vocal activist for the revival of Indian Heritage and the revival of Indian Heritage comeback in the educational system .
The following is an excerpt from his polemic article Who is afraid of Sanscrit ?
: .
 the Indian alone excels in belittling the Indian classical heritage as it has unfortunately codified it as its `` Hindu past .
This classification began in the colonial period when non-European cultures were primarily seen in religious denominations as non-Christian coloured races further divided into two broad categories , primitives or static cultures .
 Within the western world these approaches were countered first by the Orientalist and later by Modernists , both opponents of Newtonian rationalism .
 But while the Orientalist contributed to the discovery of the East by the West , Modernists also succeeded in creating a somnambulist reassurance in the minds of many Indians who never tire of revelling in praises of the Indian by Schopenhauer , Max Muller , Blavatsky , Whitman and the like .
 In spite of the the Orientalist , administrators like Macaulay forged for the Indian an education system which had little or marginal place , not only for Sanskrit literature , but for all the traditional arts and sciences like music , poetry , dance , theatre and painting , Ayurveda , Rasayan , Jyotisha , metrics , etc. .
This dichotomy continued well into the semi-century of independence and flourishes strong as ever .
 In the book Globalization & identity : cultural diversity , religion , and citizenship by Majid Teranian & B. Jeannie Lum , The editors -RRB- , where Bharat Gupt contributed the essay Religious plurality in education , passionately arguing that religious - multi-religious - education should come back to schools , in order to promote understanding of other faiths .
The editors note , in the introduction : .
 Bharat Gupt provides several recommendations for the transformation of Indias school system in teaching the Heritage Curriculum as Heritage Activity that incorporates many of the activity-based modes of instruction we associate with progressive education .

Tim Reynolds is a Grammy nominated multi-instrumentalist known as both a solo artist and as a lead guitarist for the Dave Matthews Band .
One reviewer has declared Reynolds an under-rated master .
Reynolds plays the guitar , piano , sitar , drums , violin , bass , keyboards , ethnic percussive instruments , solo djembe , harp , uses drum machines for special effects , and sings , although his performances are primarily instrumental rock music .
 As well as being the founding member of the band TR3 , the founding member of the band TR3 is one of the musicians who performed at Millers , in Charlottesville Virginia , befriending and encouraging the bartender , a young Dave Matthews , to form a band of a young Dave Matthews own , introducing a young Dave Matthews to local musicians , several of whom make up the Dave Matthews Band .
While Reynolds declined the offer to join as an official member , he recorded and toured as a sideman with the Dave Matthews Band from its inception until late 1998 , rejoining them as a permanent member in June 2008 .
He often tours with Dave Matthews as an acoustic duo , in addition to performing as a member of Dave Matthews & Friends .
Reynolds was born in Wiesbaden , Germany , where his father , a career military man , was stationed .
He says he hails from nowhere , because the family moved so often .
 Some of the places the family lived include Germany , a farm in Indiana , then on an army base in Alaska , then to Kansas , then to Missouri , where Some of the places the family lived lived longer than any other place until Some of the places the family lived was old enough to move away as an adult .
 Both parents were extremely devout Christians and Christians says Christians grew up with Christian music all around Christians .
 However , Christians older sister owned some albums from The Beatles , which Christians says , even as a very young child , Christians loved instantly , playing air guitar to Both parents music .
Upon reaching adolescence , Reynolds was able to learn guitar and electric bass guitar , so he could perform in the familys local Church choir three times a week , with the secret added bonus that he was able to begin experimenting with learning what eventually became second nature ; adding riffs infused with rock and roll , funk and soul music by the age of twelve .
 Upon graduation from high school , he moved away from home , and after moving from the Midwestern States , landed in Charlottesville Virginia , Charlottesville Virginia , finding jazz , jazz fusion , and experimental music enthusiasts there .
Reynolds found the college town a more welcoming environment for him to branch out musically there than in any of his previous homes , and added to his experimentation other musical influences to his repertoire , including sixties psychedelic rock , citing some of his early influences as Jimi Hendrix , Carlos Santana and Led Zeppelin .
By the 1990s , he had formed the Tim Reynolds Three or TR3 , and had added other influences to his repertoire ; music from Nine Inch Nails , Bob Marley and Marilyn Manson .
In addition , he continued to learn to play other instruments , including the sitar , sarod , the mandello , keytar , tubular bells and other exotic instruments that are not commonly seen in Western rock artists of the rock and roll musicians of the time .
 Reynolds was performing in Charlottesville in the late 1980s when his old college roommate , Nic Cappon , encouraged Nic Cappon to perform at a local bar , Millers , where Nic Cappon met bartender Dave Matthews .
 Reynolds explains : I played there in Charlottesville Virginia all the time .
Dave Matthews was the bartender .
 I knew the rest of a young Dave Matthews band way before that .
 We played together in Charlottesville Virginia since I moved there in 1981 .
 I would play with LeRoi Moore and Carter Beauford .
 a young Dave Matthews moved to town in 1987 .
 When the Dave Matthews Band started , I already had I own band .
 I told a young Dave Matthews , `` Ive got a band and I kind of like the way it is .
 You should start You band .
 I could see that a young Dave Matthews needed to do a young Dave Matthews own thing .
In 1993 , Reynolds and Dave Matthews started playing a few acoustic duo sets .
 These featured a young Dave Matthews music , stripped down to just the acoustic guitar , paired with Reynoldss guitar , and Reynolds occasional use of slide guitar .
During these sets , Reynolds would play between one to four of his own pieces that spanned his own catalog of work .
 After a few years these shows gained popularity , and in 1996 a young Dave Matthews and Reynolds embarked on These first full tour together as a duo .
In 1999 , coinciding with the release of the 40-date tour , Live at Luther College was released .
 After a short break , Reynolds toured again with a young Dave Matthews as a duo in 2003 .
 Reynolds and a young Dave Matthews then reprised These duo shows as an opening act for the Dave Matthews & Friends tour in 2003 and early 2004 .
 These played several shows together in 2006 and 2007 .
 Reynolds joined a young Dave Matthews on a mini-tour of Europe in February and March 2007 .
 On August 14 , 2007 , a young Dave Matthews and Reynolds released a live CD/DVD set , Live at Radio City , including the songs Stay or Leave , Gravedigger , Cornbread , and Dancing Nancies , among others .
 August 14 , 2007 also includes two of Reynolds own songs ; You are I Sanity and Betrayal .
The Radio City show was also released in high definition on Blu-ray Disc .
In 2008 , Reynolds once again joined Dave Matthews Band for the recording Big Whiskey and the Groogrux King with producer Rob Cavallo .
 It was the Tim Reynolds Three first recording collaboration with Matthews since 2003s Some Devil and the Tim Reynolds Three first with the Dave Matthews Band since 1998s Before These Crowded Streets .

The shehnai , shahnai , shenai or mangal vadya , is a double reed oboe , common in India , Pakistan , Bangladesh and Iran , made out of wood , with a metal flare bell at the end .
 Shehnai sound is thought to create and maintain a sense of auspiciousness and sanctity and , as a result , is widely used during marriages , processions , and in temples , although Its sound is also played in concerts .
Shenai is similar to South India s nadaswaram .
This tubular instrument gradually broadens towards the lower end .
 This tubular instrument usually has between six and nine holes .
 This tubular instrument employs one set of quadruple reeds , making This tubular instrument a quadruple reed woodwind .
By controlling the breath , various tunes can be played on it .
The shehnai has a range of two octaves , from the A below middle C to the A one line above the treble clef .
The ancestor of North Indian shehnai is believed to be from Persian Surna .
The shehnai is thought to have been developed by improving upon the pungi .
There are varying legends of the shehnais origin .
In one of these , a shah initially banned the playing of the pungi in his court due to its shrill sound .
A barber , belonging to a family of musicians , improved on it and created the shehnai .
 As it was played in the Shahs court and giving due reference to the nai or barber , the new instrument was called Shehnai .
Another theory of the origin of the shehnai is that the name is a modification of the word sur-nal .
The word nal/nali/nad is used in many Indian languages to mean pipe or reed .
The word sur means tone or tune -- musical note or simply music -- and is used as a prefix to the names of many Indian instruments .
 The sur-nal is said to have given The sur-nal name to the surna/zurna which is the name by which the reed-pipe is known throughout the Middle East and eastern Europe .
Shehnai is usually played at traditional North Indian weddings and is associated with the bride leaving her parental house for her husbands house .
Sometimes , two shehnais can be tied together , making it a double shawm similar to the ancient Greek aulos .
Whereas the counterparts played in West Indian and Coastal Karnatka are indigenous to the territory .
Shenai players were/are an integral part of Goan/Konkani and temples along the western coast and the players are called as Vajantri and they were alloted lands for services rendered for the temples

The Gwalior Gharana is one of the oldest Khyal Gharanas .
The rise of the Gwalior Gharana started with the reign of the great Mughal emperor Akbar .
 The favorite singers of this patron of the arts , such as Miyan Tansen , first amongst the vocalists at the court , came from the town of The Gwalior Gharana .
 During the time of Mughal kings Ustad Nathan Pir Bakhsh and Ustad Nathan Pir Bakhsh maternal grandsons were the legendary Ustad Nathan Pir Bakhsh , Hassu Khan and Nathu Khan .
The main musician in the court at the time was Ustad Bade Mohammad Khan who was famous for his taanbaazi .
Both Ustad Bade Mohammad Khan and Ustad Nathan Pir Bakhsh belonged to the same tradition of Shahi Sadarang .
 Some sources believe that Ustad Nathan Pir Bakhsh settled in The Gwalior Gharana and evolved the style features that led to this gharana .
Others claim that individuals named Nathan Pir Bakhsh and Nathu Khan founded the gharana .
The accepted version is that Nathan Pir Baksh left Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh to escape the professional rivalry with Ustad Shakkar Khan that had taken an ugly turn .
 Nathan Pir Baksh arrived in The Gwalior Gharana with Nathan Pir Baksh maternal grandsons Haddu Khan and Hassu Khan .
 Another great khyal singer , also originally from Lucknow , was Ustad Bade Mohammed Khan who brought the Taan into khyal singing .
 Haddu Khan and Hassu Khan further enhanced the style of the The Gwalior Gharana gharana as we recognize the Gwalior style today .
Hassu Khan died prematurely .
 Haddu Khan s son , Rehmat Ali Khan was a widely acclaimed singer who liberated the The Gwalior Gharana style from the methodical form the Gwalior style followed to the emotional style that Ustad Nathan Pir Bakhsh preferred .
 A distinguishing feature of the gharana is A distinguishing feature of the gharana simplicity , and one means to this is the selection of well-known ragas so that the listener is saved the effort of trying to identify the raga .
While the khyal singer does include Raga Vistar and Alankar to enhance the beauty and meaning of the raga , there is no attempt to include the Tirobhava feature in the interest of adding interest or mystery to the listeners experience .
 The singing The singing places Bandish at the heart of the presentation because of the gharanas belief that the full melody of the raga and guidance on The singing singing is provided by the bandish .
The asthayi section is sung twice before the antara , to be followed by swar-vistar in medium tempo .
This slow rendition of the notes is known as the Behlava , and is sung from Ma in the lower register to Pa in the higher register , following the pattern of the Aaroha and Avaroha of the raga .
The behlava is divided into the asthayi and antara .
The Dugun-Ka-Alap follows in which groups of two or four note combinations are sung in quicker succession but the basic tempo remains the same .
The Bol-Alap is next in which the different words of the text are sung in different ways , to be followed by Murkis in which notes are sung with ornamentation to a faster pace .
Bol-Taans entail the formation of melodic sequences with the words of the song .
 The other The Sapat Taan , including the Gamak , follow .
 The Sapat Taan is important to the The Gwalior Gharana style and refers to the singing of notes in a straight sequence and at a Vilambit pace .
 Both Dhrupad and khyal singing evolved in The Gwalior Gharana and there are many overlaps .
In the khyal style there is one form , Mundi Dhrupad , that incorporates all the features of dhrupad singing but without the Mukhda .
Common ragas include Alhaiya Bilawal , Yaman , Bhairav , Sarang , Shree , Hameer , Gaud Malhar , and Miya Ki Malhar
The tambura , tanpura , tamburi is a long-necked plucked lute found in different forms in Indian music culture .
Hindustani musicians speak of tanpura whereas Carnatic musicians say tambura ; tamburi is a smaller instrument used for accompanying instrumental soloists .
For practical use , all these types are called tanpura in the text .
 The body shape of the tanpura somewhat resembles that of the sitar , but The body shape of the tanpura has no frets - as the strings are always plucked at their full lengths .
One or more tanpuras may be used to accompany vocalists or instrumentalists .
 One has four or five wire strings , which are plucked one after another in a regular pattern to create a harmonic resonance on the basic note or keynote .
Tanpuras form the root of the ensemble and indeed of the music itself , as the tanpura creates an acoustic dynamic reference chord from which the ragas derive their distinctive character , color and flavor .
Concerning its history , a quote from A. D. Ranade : The first unambiguous reference to the tanpura is in Sangit Parijat .
It is neither mentioned by the earlier texts nor does it find a place in sculptures .
An electronic tanpura , a small box that imitates the sound of a tanpura , is often used in contemporary Indian classical music performances instead of , or in addition to a tanpura .
 One or more tanpuras come in different sizes and pitches : larger males , smaller females for vocalists , and a yet smaller version is used for accompanying sitar or sarod , called tamburi .
 Male vocalists pitch Male vocalists tonic note , often at C # ; female singers usually a fifth higher , though these tonic notes may vary according to the preference of the singer , as there is no absolute and fixed pitch-reference in the Indian classical music systems .
The male instrument has an open string length of approximately one metre ; the female is three-fourths of the male .
The standard tuning is 5-8-8-1 or , in Indian sargam , PA-sa-sa-SA .
For ragas that omit the fifth tone , pa , the first string is tuned down to the natural fourth : 4-8-8-1 or Ma-sa-sa-Sa .
Some ragas require a less common tuning with shuddh NI , NI-sa-sa-SA .
With a five-string instrument , the seventh or NI can be added : PA-NI-sa-sa-SA or MA-NI-sa-sa-SA .
The name tanapura is probably derived from tana , referring to a musical phrase , and pura , which means full or complete .
 Both in The name tanapura musical function and how it works , the tanpura is unique in many ways .
It does not partake in the melodic part of the music , but it supports and sustains the melody by providing a colourful and dynamic harmonic resonance field based on one precise tone , the basic note or key note .
Also , it is not played in rhythm with the music , as the precise timing of plucking a cycle of four strings in a continuous loop is a determinant factor in the resultant sound .
The special overtone-rich sound and the audible movement in the inner resonances of tone is achieved by applying the principle of jivari or jawari which creates a sustained buzzing sound in which particular harmonics will resonate with focused clarity .
 Jiva refers to soul , that Jiva gives life , implying that the tanpura embodies an animated tone quality .
Another linguistic reference is sawari which means saddle .
The principle of jivari can be compared to the prismatic refraction of white light into the colours of the rainbow , as its acoustic twin principle at work , amplifying the inner resonances of a tone to audible harmonics .
To achieve this effect , the strings pass over a wide , arched bridge , the front of which slopes gently away from the surface of the strings .
When a string is plucked , it has an intermittent periodical grazing contact with the bridge ; this intermittent grazing of the string on the curved bridge will move around in the sonation process , as the points of contact will gradually shift , being a compound function of amplitude , the curvature of the bridge , pitch and string tension .
When the string is plucked , it has a large amplitude , moving up and down and contacting the bridge on the down-phase .
As the energy of the strings movement gradually diminishes , the contact point of the string with the bridge slowly creeps up the slope of the bridge like a wave out of the sea spending itself on the beach .
Depending on scale and pitch , this can take between three and ten seconds .
This dynamic process can be fine-tuned using a cotton thread between string and bridge : by shifting the thread , the grazing contact sequence is shifted to a different position on the bridge , changing the harmonic content .
 Every single string produces This dynamic process own cascading range of harmonics and , at the same time , builds up a particular resonance .
 According to this principle , One or more tanpuras are attentively tuned to achieve a particular tonal shade relative to the tonal characteristics of the raga .
These more delicate aspects of tuning are directly related to what Indian musicians call raga svaroop , which is about how characteristic intonations are important defining aspects of a particular raga .
 The tanpuras particular setup , with the cotton thread as a variable focus-point , made The tanpuras particular setup possible to explore a multitude of harmonic relations produced by the subtle harmonic interplay in time of The tanpuras particular setup four strings
