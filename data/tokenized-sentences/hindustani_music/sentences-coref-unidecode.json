{"sentence": "The rubbing and its proper technique ensures that the layers are each uniformly thick , tapering slightly at the edges to smoothly merge in the layer below."}
{"sentence": "The process of rubbing generates heat in the paste applied and achieves the function of drying the paste and also the frictional vibration of the surface with the stone results in a fine latticework of cracks leaving grains of syahi attached only to the base of the layer below."}

{"sentence": "A shruti is considered the smallest interval of pitch that the human ear can detect."}
{"sentence": "To know the real meaning of Shruti , it is important to know the various contexts in the history of Indian music where the term is used."}
{"sentence": "Bharata uses Shruti to mean the interval between two notes such that the difference between Shruti is perceptible."}
{"sentence": "He formulates jatis , which are classes of melodic structures."}
{"sentence": "These can be further grouped into two gramas -- shadja-grama and madhyama-grama."}
{"sentence": "The notes are separated by intervals , which are measured in terms of shrutis."}

{"sentence": "Bharata also describes an experiment to obtain the correct physical configuration of shruti in shadja grama , Sarana Chatushtai."}

{"sentence": "Shruti is only mentioned as a perceptual measure in the music of Bharatas time."}

{"sentence": "The 53-TET approximation has an maximum error of 1.5 cents , while the perfect fifths approximation has an maximum error of 2 cents."}
{"sentence": "The table below shows the Harmonic scales into Shruti :."}

{"sentence": "Theres not multiples of 7 , 11 , 13 , 17 , 23 , etc. , just of 19 so thats too weird."}
{"sentence": "Really its not 19 , but 19.2 , because 19.2 / 32 = 3/5 , which means that when we use the harmonic 19.2 , it becomes the harmonic 3 , and all of the harmonics multiplies up by 5."}
{"sentence": "By the time Venkatamakhin formulated the melakarta system , the grama system was no longer in use."}
{"sentence": "Unlike the grama system , the mela system uses the same starting swara."}
{"sentence": "it forms the scales by varying the intervals of the subsequent swaras , and does not specify a fixed interval for a swara in terms of shrutis."}
{"sentence": "For example , the intervals of kakali-nishada and shuddha-madhyama would vary depending on the dhaivata and the gandhara that precede them , respectively."}
{"sentence": "The interval of kakali-nishada would be of three different shruti values depending on whether shuddha , panca-sruti or shat-shruti-dhaivata preceded it."}

{"sentence": "Some scholars have attempted to fit such perceived new tones into the non-contextual Bharatas 22 shrutis , which lead to confusion and controversy over 22 shrutis."}
{"sentence": "the non-contextual Bharatas 22 shrutis was also wrongly attributed to Bharata , who proposed Shruti in a completely different context."}
{"sentence": "There is scientific evidence that shows that these intermediate tones perceived in the contemporary rendition of a raga does not hint at the existence of 22 shrutis."}
{"sentence": "The number 22 is of no practical significance in the current performance of Carnatic and Hindustani music traditions , partly because different musicians use slightly different shrutis when performing the same raga."}
{"sentence": "The phenomenon of intermediate tones is pursued as an active area of research in Indian Musicology , which says the number of perceptible intermediate tones may be less or even much more than 22."}

{"sentence": "Tala , Taal or Tal , is the term used in Indian classical music for the rhythmic pattern of any composition and for the entire subject of rhythm , roughly corresponding to metre in Western music , though closer conceptual equivalents are to be found in the older system of rhythmic mode and its relations with the foot of classical poetry , or with other Asian classical systems such as the notion of usul in the theory of Ottoman/Turkish music."}

{"sentence": "However , melodies do not always begin on the first beat of the tala but may be offset , for example to suit the words of a composition so that the most accented word falls upon the sam."}

{"sentence": "The tala is indicated visually by using a series of rhythmic hand gestures called kriyas that correspond to the angas or limbs , or vibhag of the tala."}
{"sentence": "These movements define the tala in Carnatic music , and in the Hindustani tradition too , when learning and reciting the tala , the first beat of any vibhag is known as tali and is accompanied by a clap of the hands , while an empty vibhag is indicated with a sideways wave of the dominant clapping hand or the placing of the back of the hand upon the base hands palm instead."}

{"sentence": "He was one of the few musicians who had mastered the Gayaki of three different Gharanas - i.e. Singing style of three musical traditions - schools."}

{"sentence": "Mastering the Gayaki of a given Gharana naturally involved mastering new Ragas and new compositions."}
{"sentence": "However a question arises as to what was the source of Buwa 's thirst for being a lifelong learner of music ?"}
{"sentence": "What motivated him ?"}
{"sentence": ""}
{"sentence": "The source of such hunger to learn may have lied in his sheer sense of wonder and excitement about the beauty and the depth of the vast Universe of the Hindustani Art Music."}

{"sentence": "Being aware of his own strength in terms of his sharp intellect , excellent memory , quick grasp of the musical material presented , fertile imagination and also the limitation of the quality of his poor voice he seems to have chosen the Gurus and the Gharanas that matched the Gurus musical background and the Gurus strength and limitations."}
{"sentence": "Thus he started his musical journey as a child learning from his father the great Pandit Antubuwa."}
{"sentence": "His further musical growth came about when he became a disciple of Pandit Vazebuwa."}
{"sentence": "It was Vazebuwa 's complex Gwailor Gayaki that attracted Gajananbuwa to the Gurus."}

{"sentence": "He did sometimes start with ` Nom Tom ' of Agra Gharana and would continue singing a Khyal in Gwailor Gharana Tradition."}
{"sentence": "But the two parts of his performance would be distinct , and the movement or flow from Nom Tom to Aalapi would be smooth and natural."}
{"sentence": "There would never be any mixture of Aalapi or Tana Patterns or phrases of the Gayaki of two or more three different Gharanas."}
{"sentence": "An extraordinary feat !"}
{"sentence": ""}
{"sentence": "One of the key lessons Buwa learnt from his Guru Vazebuwa was how to unravel or unfold a given Raga."}
{"sentence": "The result of mastering this lesson from the Gurus was that in Gajananbuwa 's performances a listener would often experience both the clarity and simplification of complex patterns of Tanas."}
{"sentence": "The so-called conceptual or intellectual Gayaki of Jaipur Gharana sounded less complex in Buwa 's presentation."}
{"sentence": "His voice as a result of a continuous and rigorous daily Riyaz of many hours had acquired extraordinary weight and perfect tunefulness."}

{"sentence": "Some mathematicians define Mathematics as the science of order."}
{"sentence": "We may describe the Hindustani Art Music as an Art of order."}
{"sentence": "If Gajananbuwa had chosen to be a Mathematician it is more than likely that he would have made some significant contribution to Mathematics."}
{"sentence": "But the world of Hindustani Art Music is fortunate that he became a singer."}

{"sentence": "it is sometimes argued that presents a music meant for theatre and not for the independent art."}
{"sentence": "This controversy is a creation of the post-industrial era in the Indian , when as in the West , the relationship of music with poetry , dance , painting and sculpture was ruptured."}
{"sentence": "Such issues , however , have been raised in the world of Indian music only."}

{"sentence": "This pattern obtains even now in Indian music."}

{"sentence": "While examining the state of affairs in India the author also suggests a way for the pursuit of happiness through unselfish transcendence."}
{"sentence": "It is further imagined that in spite of its poverty , the Indian is admired by the richer nations of the West as a culturally evolved nation."}
{"sentence": "This self-congratulation , lingering from the euphoric days of our freedom struggle , sounds now like the thunder on distant mountains shedding not a glimmer of hope on our present lives."}
{"sentence": "For most of us our memory is enough to be a lived-through account of the cultural decline that set in barely within a decade after freedom."}
{"sentence": "Any analysis is sufficient to counter the smug belief , still fostered in schools and political speeches about the superiority of our culture , once voiced in Iqbals song , Saare Jahaan se acchaa Hindustan hamaaraa."}
{"sentence": "Very insidiously this rhyme nurses a misplaced conviction that while many other ancient civilizations were wiped out in time , the Indian alone is indestructible... The song takes special pride in stating that while the Greek and Roman civilizations , the so-called predecessors of the West , lost to ravages of time , Indian civilization alone remains immortal."}
